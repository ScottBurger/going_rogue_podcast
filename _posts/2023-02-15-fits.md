If we FITS then we SITS down to listen to this week's episode on Fights in Tight Spaces! Drop into a room with a bunch of very patient and polite criminals for this highly stylized deckbuilding roguelike. Keep your momentum up, sharpen up those high heels, and watch those replays of the spinning roundhouse kicks yeet those biker gangs right out the door!
