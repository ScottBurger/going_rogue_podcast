Season 2 has come to an end with an impressive slate of top-tier rogue games! If you've never listened to the show before, these recap episodes are a great place to start. This year we see how well our new #1 overall rated game of Slay the Spire will hold off contenders like Vampire Survivors and Balatro. We revisit some oldies and goodies with games spanning releases all the way back to 2003! We have some great listener comments sprinkled throughout, including some of the devs from games that we've covered. So go get a corndog (grogdog?), a #1 fan foam finger or two, and strap in for our longest, and therefore best podcast episode to date.

Our finalists include: 
* [Blue Prince](https://grogpod.zone/2025-06-04-blue-prince/)
* [Caves of Qud](https://grogpod.zone/2025-11-05-caves-of-qud-gameplay)
* [Deadzone: Rogue](https://grogpod.zone/2025-10-08-deadzone-rogue/)
* [Elden Ring Nightreign](https://grogpod.zone/2025-08-27-elden-ring-nightreign/)
* [Hades](https://grogpod.zone/2025-01-17-hades/)
* [Halls of Torment](https://grogpod.zone/2025-12-03-halls-of-torment/)
* [Hero's Hour](https://grogpod.zone/2025-09-24-heros-hour/)
* [Noita](https://grogpod.zone/2025-03-12-noita/)
* [Path of Achra](https://grogpod.zone/2025-05-07-path-of-achra/)
