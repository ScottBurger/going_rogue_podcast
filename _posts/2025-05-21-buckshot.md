Draw! This week we go akimbo with two high-caliber games between the college project wild west themed deckbuilding hit Forty-Five and an Estonian Eurotrance solo dev effort in Buckshot Roulette! We'll spin the barrel on what makes a free game good, if board games are roguelites (because what isn't at this rate?) and whether or not we fired six shots, or only five. Are you feeling lucky enough to go double or nothing?
