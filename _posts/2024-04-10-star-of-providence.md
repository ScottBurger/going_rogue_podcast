What else would you expect from the bullet hell game that is Star of Providence? A charming, NES-inspired modern throwback, Star of Providence puts us to the test with harrowing boss fights, secret endings, and more guns than you can shake a sword that shoots bullets at! 

Team D-13 were kind enough to give a quick Q&A on how Star of Providence came about for us. Give it a look-see here!
