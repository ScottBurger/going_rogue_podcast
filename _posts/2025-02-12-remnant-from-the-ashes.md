This week in "wait, that's not a roguelike!" we tackle the Souls-like shooter Remnant: From the Ashes! A lot of high-budget games that aren't rogue-first have been coming out with rogue modes and Remnant is no exception with it's DLC-based mode: Survival. Join us to complain about getting bodied by bosses, watching out for archers, and trying to figure out just how much chocolate you need in a cake before you call it a chocolate cake.
