If the weather outside is fightful, than curl up in front of the fireplace with your favorite roguelike games! That's how the song goes, right?

With only one day's worth of ticket time this year, we had to cram as much into one recording as possible before familial duties took precedence. Check the timestamps below for interviews with friends of all sorts and their games and studios.
