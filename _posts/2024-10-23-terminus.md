The dead walk! It's after midnight and something evil's attacking your town in Terminus: Zombie Survivors. A turn-based, grid-based, permadeath RPG with open-world survival crafting, Terminus turns the spook factor up for this ghoulish episode with Walkers galore. Barracade that door, cover the windows with some bloody rags and cozy up in a corner of a pharmacy with your favorite roguelike podcast! And though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to shiver! For no mere mortal can resists, the evil of the Terminus! (Vincent Price laughter)
