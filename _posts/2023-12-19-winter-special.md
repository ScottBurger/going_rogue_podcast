The end of season 1 of the podcast is here and to celebrate we are pitting our top games in a playoff tournament fight to the death!

With a wide range of categories from platformer rogues, to solo dev efforts, to squad management simulators, there's something for everyone today. Thanks to all the listeners that voted as well!
