Clap! Bow! Clap! Clap! Bow! Not even 6 days of power outage can stop this week's attempt at exorcising demons of the world, as we visit fictional 198X Japan's World of Horror. We explore a manga-style 1-bit Shiokawa, where a spooky lighthouse is causing something strage in the neighborhood. Evil Eldritch gods are awakening to turn our shower water into black goo, the townsfolk into bloodthirsty cultists, and even our apartment neighbors against us! Together, we can help solve the mysteries of "Spine-Chilling Story of School Scissors",  "Freaky Feature of Found Footage", and many other awesomely alliterative manga mystery thrillers. There's very vew problems a crowbar and kicking can't solve! Especially when they're sourced from a happy Shiba Inu dog vendor.
