OwO it's VTuber time! This week we grab out pet aligators and wrap them in a trench coat to investigate the wild world of Holocure - Save the Fans! We're talking jazzy beats, explosions of color, shrimp simps, skeletons with baseball bats, and (you guessed it!) six-legged monsterific horrors that would be well at home in any HR Geiger film. To navigate this deep sector of internet a-pog-rypha, we're joined by VTuber and friend of the show Daniru17! We'll need all the help we can get unraveling the mysteries of the Shubangelion and where exactly that character upgrade tab in the shop is.

Here's where you can find Daniru17 on the interwebz!
