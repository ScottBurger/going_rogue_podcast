description: "Lousy Smarch weather! Come in from the cold and warm up with an episode on the recent hit citybuilder roguelite Against the Storm. We've got biscuits and pie, jerky, and a nice dry roof to keep your resolve high. There's lots to talk about between lizard happiness, a Queen that no one has confirmed exists or not, and everyone's favorite topic: supply chain logistics! Man it's wet out there. Check me through will you?
