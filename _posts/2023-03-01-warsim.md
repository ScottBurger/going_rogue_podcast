description: "This week is a podcast episode so cunning you could brush your teeth with it! We finally answer the question: what if Dwarf Fortress, Zork, and Black Adder all joined forces into a game made by a single person in a 70,000 line long single program? Why of course the answer is Warsim: The Realm of Aslona! In our most widely divergent podcast thus far, we talk about goblin arena fighting statistics and gambling addictions, failing history exams of the Far North, and of course, the Doomstone!

1:20 - game stats
3:03 - one sentence summary
1:04:49 - rankings and final thoughts
