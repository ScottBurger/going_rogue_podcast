## How did the four members of the team first meet? 
Sup, thanks for reaching out!
We were all part of the same community during our formative years, it was centered around a sandbox shmup creation program called Fraxy. There are a lot of videos from that time still on youtube.
In a sense we've been doing a form of game development as a hobby for a very long time now thanks to that thing.

## What challenges arose from managing a small and highly international project?
We already talk every day through communication software like Discord and stuff like Skype or IRC back then, so keeping in touch is not a problem like one would expect. We try to keep things simple and just work on things we like as they come and that has worked so far, though not being able to work the same hours side by side does hurt the schedule sometimes. Really I can't think of anything that presents a significant challenge to the way we work otherwise.

## Why a SHMUP roguelike?
Me and Pure have been playing Binding of Isaac since the flash version first came out and it had a lot of impact on us. One doesn't need to look closely to see the resemblance. Really, the project started as a way to see if we can make something like that on our own, back when we barely knew anything about coding, drawing and whatever. A lot of shmup elements got thrown into the pot because that's what we liked and knew best when working it out.

## Now that the title is Star of Providence, do you hope to be able to launch on Playstation and Xbox after the Switch release?
No plans yet.

## Thanks for such a great game and best wishes for the upcoming launch on Switch!
Likewise, thanks and take care!
