Greetings friends and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast where each episode of this we land on a roguelike game, we strip it for lewd and craft some kind of opinion on it at the end of the episode for our end of season recap at the end of the year.
0:54
I am your trilby wearing mutated space BLOB host of a podcast Scott Burger and with me are my Deep Space Convict Co hosts.
I'm some kind of a horrible FPS mutant.
Andrew Hirshman.
And I'm calling a sandwich you found on that ship.
1:14
Today we are jumping into the void with Void Bastards FPS game released on May 29th, 2019 that you can sort of find everywhere between PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch.
And it was published and developed by Blue Manchu Games who are based out of Australia and quite the pedigree LED who who are led by Jonathan Che who is the former director of Bioshock one and two.
1:45
A game you may have heard of.
Blue Manchu has also developed a free to play tactical RPG card game called Card Hunter.
And as we record this September 9th, 3 days from now, we are getting the spiritual spiritual successor to Avoid Bastards, Wild Bastards.
2:03
Also developed by Blue Manchu, this game was published by Maximum Entertainment I think, who have also published a number of other notable rogue titles such as One Step from Eden, Wizard of Legend, Ring of Pain, and Crying Sons.
2:21
Avoid Bastards crashes into the space whale at #180 of the most popular roguelike games on our list with 5137 total reviews.
Andrew, this time you have the the honor of this, or of describing what one does in Void Bastards with the limited amount of oxygen you have left.
2:46
Well, fortunately in the six hours I've played, this game, never run out of oxygen ever.
So I could theoretically introduce this game for an extended period of time with 0 problems.
I I have no idea what happens when the oxygen runs out.
3:06
I'm guessing you die.
Total kind of you know what I well they're like oxygen consoles they can do anyway all right so the you are you assume the role in this randomly generated procedurally generated FPS game quirky FPS game with a quirky sense of humor and quirky British accents and things of that nature where in you play a space criminal who's been brought out of cryostasis and has been given the opportunity to reduce their sentence by performing various tasks for some kind of group.
3:42
I'm not totally sure.
And those tasks involve going out in the far reaches of space and attaching yourself and docking with derelict space stations that are infested with various, well, not splicers, but like space mutants of various kinds.
4:04
And it is up to you to loot is it is very much it's it's kind of like a looter shooter, except the loot is boring and the shooting sucks.
So that being said, I couldn't help but enjoy a fair bit of my my time with this game.
4:20
But yeah, procedurally generated space game where you play quirky characters with quirky traits, some of which are interesting, which can't always be said for randomly generated, randomly assigned traits.
Boyd bastards.
Which I mean, the sequel is like totally different setting.
4:38
And so I'm interested to see like how much of that DNA pulls over.
Yeah, transfer though.
It is.
It is.
Yeah.
It is.
Like it's like Wild West robots in space with kind of a lot of the same like humor and like artistic direction, but.
4:57
Like what the world esque in terms of like space western?
Yeah, but I would say even more like robot Y or like or sci-fi Y 'cause there's like a guy with like a flaming head.
There's like 1 character who's just like a straight up spider lady.
I don't.
5:13
Like Wild Wild West, the Will Smith movie from the early.
The Will Smith documentary, actually, yeah, I was.
I was excited to jump into this.
I was also excited to accidentally skip over the most important part of my preamble, which is how long people have played this game.
5:29
Your average player is about 13 hours in it.
There, I did it.
Yeah.
I was kind of excited to to jump into this when Andrew picked it.
So I'm like aha yes I remember noodling around with this with Xbox Game Pass way like 2-3 years ago.
I'm like yeah I remember it being pretty fun but I don't remember why I hadn't thought about it much since.
5:49
And because recently the Void or the Wild Bastards demo had come out a few months ago.
Has that been removed from the Internet?
'Cause I believe so.
I think it was.
I think it was for one of those time limited Steam demo fests 'cause yeah, it was like, man, I one thing I I took a note in my my dog here was like, all right, while playing void bastards.
6:13
Am I just going to be wanting to play wild bastards the whole time?
And maybe we'll we'll come back to it in a minute.
But but yeah, I thought like the the the interesting aspect of wild Bastards, I'm like, OK, yes, let's jump back into Void bastards.
6:29
It's been out a while.
It's had some time to settle.
We'll see what that's like and how it's going to kind of set us up for success later this week.
I thought the the first hour or so that I played at this was pretty good, was pretty good.
I don't know, I mean.
Interesting the first hour 'cause the first hour for me was like the worst part.
6:50
Followed by I agree with Scott, like I, I thought the I think the art of this game is really interesting.
And I found the first hour or two to be like, oh, this is thrilling.
This is like fun and interesting.
And then it was that that that was it.
7:07
Well, it was.
It was Colin.
You like that?
Well guess what?
We got another 15 hours of that exact same thing for you.
Yeah, that, yeah, that's far from ideal, that's for sure.
Well, what happens in that first hour, pray tell, which I'm sorry, before we get into that real really quick, did you see it was #180?
7:27
It is scroll, scroll, scroll.
Yes, the 180th most popular roguelike game on Steam 5000 reviews.
That is pretty surprising.
Pretty surprising I.
Wish that we could do something that like normalizes based off year of release because I think definitely like the late well, although I guess this.
7:49
Is kind of.
Five years ago now, right?
In a way, yeah, it released 2019.
In a way it kind of self normalizes because like I feel like if a game is good enough, it will continue get like garnering reviews over time.
And and Even so, like if we do find one of these diamond in the rough games where it's like, you know, it's like, you know #500 or something on our list, just scrolling through our our previous episodes here, like some some games are like in the one thousands, like pineapple smash crews at the bottom of our list here, popularity at the 1330 ninth most popular game.
8:28
Some of them are using hand WAVY magic, but still like there's there's yeah, like I don't know, like review volume is one way to kind of garner popularity.
There's there's a million different metrics, but like that one I felt has always been kind of the most consistent for.
8:45
I can see how this game I I can see how this game could get a large number of reviews specifically.
Right.
Yeah, I think that's a big part.
Of it, it is like Andrew proposed a couple of games for this week and this one absolutely popped out to me as like, oh, that looks interesting.
9:03
I wanted to play this game like it looked like I was excited to get into it because it's got a really cool looking art style.
It it's got AI mean.
Maybe it's just got a good trailer.
It looks snappy and poppy from the gecko.
9:19
And I felt like, you know, for the first half an hour for the first hour, like I I was 100% convinced that it was succeeding in its promise.
So I can see why you could get people drawn in long enough to either decide to like it or not and then review it.
9:39
Versus I think there's a lot of other games that I've liked a lot that you like them despite their visual appeal or their initial, you know, they're they, they make a poor sell for the the quality of the game.
I think this one, like, sells itself extraordinarily well, perhaps too well.
10:02
I think we we talk a lot about visual visual fidelity as like a first impression with games, and I think like there's a lot of games, traditional rogue likes especially, that have a bad problem with like, you know, the graphics don't matter.
It's all about the gameplay.
10:18
But then you don't have that hook that like that immediate.
You know, you're on the store page like, Oh, this looks interesting.
You really have to kind of invest the time into understanding the game places and just kind of get it.
Whereas this, you know, we're we're, you know, talking about a a very visually distinct comic book art style in space that has kind of like a hard chunky, like dirty Star Warsian cartoon.
10:43
A.
Little bit of a cartoon vibe to, I mean explicitly cartoon in the story stuff.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
And you know, good segue into how our story begins here with you being woken up into some sort of bureaucratic prison ship where you're desiccated remains are rehydrated and you're given the goal of well, the ship has classic Star Trek trope floated into a nebula and some wild nebula shit has happened.
11:17
You get a restart the the the FTL drive get us out of here and you're you're running around this tutorial ship, which is yeah, I think this is a pretty good tutorial for what the game is going to entail.
Running around your your type.
You're like clicking on stuff to get some loot and then pirates attack and then all of a sudden you are running away from Glaswegon.
11:38
Limies show accented pirates who are hunting you down.
And I think, I think you're forced to die in this sequence.
I don't remember but kind of kicking you.
Are.
Yeah, yeah.
But like, I felt very.
Cheated because I thought.
I got away.
11:54
Yeah.
Well, the the deaths, yeah, the death screen pops up so fast in this game.
You're just like, wait, what happened?
And then, yeah, the IT kind of kicks you off on the loop of all right, the pirates have kind of quote UN quote, you know, taken care of this derelict vessel and moved on.
12:12
But luckily there's thousands of other prisoner like dehydrated milk packages that are restarted.
And this is how this is kind of your character loop of like, oh, you're going to start a new character, huh.
Well, let's get a new dry powder packet to to dump into the boiling water.
12:32
And then you are you are sent on our favorite thing that we like to encounter in these games, an FTL style node traversal map where you're, I think it's this is this is, I think pretty well done where you are given a mission of you got to go find Mac guffin #1 and you have your node map laid out in front of you.
12:58
And there's a little like blinking, pulsating objective of you got to you got to go in this direction.
And I think it's pretty good about directing you where to go.
And you have all these different colorful spaceships to click on and say, all right, well, am I going to travel to this one?
Am I going to spend the fuel to get here and the food necessary?
13:15
Am I going to board this guy to loot it?
It starts to open up all the action space and and really kind of kick off the game's mechanics.
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, like explanation of, of where you're going.
I thought the the ships were, they had a pretty good job of explaining like what kind of things you might find on this ship.
13:36
Yeah.
And then you traverse to that ship you you board it through one of the airlocks and then the goal is to get whatever loot you can off of the ship without.
At first I thought it was dying, but really it's without taking too much damage because like many roguelikes, the damage is permanent and it's somewhat difficult to heal it.
13:59
So like I was like, ha, ha, I got off the ship with three HP and then I was like, that's actually not great.
I'm going to get absolutely immediately killed on the next Oh, Oh, and I'm dead.
Like I had one one shot and I guess I got one shot post like 15 HP from you get from or or however much you get from like resting during the jump and eating a sandwich.
14:23
But yeah I got like 2.
Shot so, and importantly conserving your ammo too, because this game has a bit of a meta progression curve to it.
Where you are, you're collecting stuff and that stuff builds into things and those things build into guns and components to guns and lots of others.
14:46
Shooty Mcshootums and I see this game or I'm going to open up this can of worms here.
I see this game compared a lot to immersive Sims.
I don't.
Know what that means?
That is, well, like, so.
I mean, you've played.
You've played like Ding, Ding, Ding.
15:02
This is an immersive SIM.
I mean, this is by like an immersive SIM guy.
Yeah.
And we're right out of the gate.
Here's how you know it's an immersive SIM.
This is the only requirement to be able for this big laundry list, right?
Check it out.
All you need is right click is use like that's.
That's an.
15:18
Immersive SIM.
Have you played Deus Ex?
Like the original Deus Ex or any of the Dishonored games?
It's like a game where it's like here's a semi open environment and there are like multiple ways for there are multiple systems that exist for the player to use to achieve their goals and the.
15:36
There's a game I play where right click is used as Minecraft Immersive.
SIM.
Well, it's like, it's very popular with like, you know, well, basically the Deus Ex and series and Bioshock and System Shock and all that jazz and, and.
15:51
The the recent Prey remake and I guess I should maybe also mention Cruelty Squad, everyone's favorite visual barfamatic style arfamatic.
Is right, but sorry back to your point Scott, so you see this compared to immersive Sims.
I I don't think it quite, you know, achieves the immersive SIM.
16:13
It doesn't quite climb that mountain and like get to the top and and I'd really deliver on that.
But theoretically there are like different ways to achieve things like you don't always have to fight.
You can stealth, you can hack stuff.
They're like, you know, stuff There's there's things like that.
So it's kind of there, but I, I don't, I don't know if this game had enough time or enough of a budget to really nail it.
16:33
Well, I feel like the.
Problem is that maybe that it it's immersive SIM in that there are different ways that you could do it over the course of time perhaps, but it's it's the same regardless.
Like each each time you die, you don't reset your loot, you keep the same like overall items you have.
16:54
So whatever strategy you you've, you've worked your way towards, you end up kind of keeping that strategy.
So it's like, Oh no, you got a new guy.
Oh, he coughs.
Now it's like.
Cool.
Are you in a different build?
It's like, well, no, because you have the same items you had before.
17:11
So whatever was your good Strat that last run is your strategy is going to essentially be the same thing Like, oh, I'm going to poison dart this guy.
I'm going to like hack these turrets.
Like maybe you put some work into getting a different, you know, oh, I, I, I really tried hard to make sure that I could hack the turrets or something, but.
17:29
Yeah, it's not so much, it's not so much that like your build is defined by the stuff that you pick up along the run.
You're like, OK, now like it's that, it's that cardinal thing of like being able to like define what your build is at the start and like following a build order basically.
17:46
And instead of just like, ah, yes, I've picked up this this wild thing along the way.
How can like, what can I do around that to change my play style for this?
I don't really think it hits hits that note, but it's it's a hard note to hit because like I feel like what Andrew was talking about with immersive Sims, it's like you have you have a very bespoke pre designed puzzle that has a lot of different roots to solve it, which is like almost it's almost like the opposite of a rogue like game in a way.
18:15
And well, actually, you know, what game did do immersive SIM and rogue like meshing very well was streets of Rogue where, you know, you had like an objective.
He was like, go, go and get this key from this gorilla or something.
Very kind of silly objectives and the options that you had available were kind of all over the place.
18:35
You know, your your character as a hacker.
You could hack into stuff in order to free the gorillas, who would then pummel all the scientists to death.
And then who would then, you know, break out and then you could get the key from the gorilla by pickpocketing or something like that.
Could be.
A gorilla and just be like hello gorilla bro, let's break out together, right?
18:54
Exactly, and while I was playing Void Bastards, I kept think like, am I going to be wanting to play Wild Bastards instead?
I think I wanted to play a game that is is kind of what Void Bastards is going for, but does everything better.
19:11
Well, most things better.
A little game called Heat Signature and that is the game that was developed by Tom Francis who just recently released Tactical Breach Wizards.
And yeah, I, I was very sad when I realized that we really couldn't justify playing that on this podcast because I want I, I'm, I, I feel like we still might just be like, fuck it, it's not a rogue leg, but it feels like it could be.
19:39
So let's just play it and review it anyway.
We'll.
Save that for the for the Patreon exclusive content.
I think like heat signature, it's it's a space boarding game where you can do all of those kind of sandboxing immersive SIM elements to much better degree.
19:54
But I think that like like Voidmaster is like is really good in that is it is a first person shooter game, but I feel like it's super limited because of that technology because like there's so much visual complexity with like a three-dimensional environment that like if you tried to do like half the things that you wanted to do in Streets of Rogue or.
20:18
Heat signature like like the most, the most normal objective and heat signature.
One of the runs I did yesterday was like attaching onto a ship, stealthing around like teleport, like swapping positions with enemies to like stealthily kill them and steal their key cards.
20:35
And then like blowing up sections of the ship so I could like jump across the void of space to the other side.
Like it was just like, I'm just like, how on earth would you program any of that into a first person shooter?
It'd be like almost impossible but.
Or at least.
It'd be impossible for a small indie team.
20:52
Like that's true.
Maybe do it if you were have like Baldur's Gate three budget, but it'd be a different game.
Yeah, like.
The the recent, the recent or quote UN quote recent, the more recent Prey game kind of did that where it was like, you know, you have these like outside the ship space traversal elements and you know, you have like non lethal takedowns and a lot more like stealth oriented, like pacifist play style things like, you know, picking up like very half lifestyle solutions of like picking up a thing like barricading a door with A to keep the enemy from getting in.
21:31
I feel like at least in the little mid of time that we've put in and we I think we all kind of got the nebula depth too.
So we all I need to know what this game's about.
But like it didn't seem like a lot of those options were available.
It's just like gun gun, bigger gun.
21:47
That's kind of slightly.
Different gun.
Honestly, I don't feel like it was the IT was for me.
It was run around, click on green thing, which is whatever.
Like I, I like at first I thought it was like, oh, it's really clever.
They've got the like color coding for all of the loot.
You know, wherever you go in a room, it's green to you find like they've got a wide variety of things that you can loot from and that they've always got the little green to show what what's lootable.
22:13
But then it ended up just becoming like color scan across room, find green, click green, leave, interact with nothing else in any other way and.
Then trying to figure out which which of that stuff I picked up was Plas well.
22:30
No, I didn't even matter.
Like I didn't.
I would like to get to the end of a, a, a like a ship and be like, I wonder what I got like I, I don't, I wouldn't even look at the like, Oh, you picked up something.
I was like, I don't it, it makes no difference to me what I'm picking up in, in the, the during the mission, like I'm going to grab whatever's there.
22:52
There's no indication on the map of like what the things are so that you can't make informed decisions on this.
You're just going and finding whatever crap's lying around and you're taking it all back.
You don't have an inventory, you don't have a weight limit.
Like there are no decisions to be made except for try to get more loot or call it quits and go back to the ship.
23:13
Yeah, I might fight back.
Just a touch on that because fuel at the very least is shown on the map and like there are sometimes where you do have to kind of make a tactical decision, a very light one of like, all right, I have two minutes of oxygen.
23:30
This place is swarming with bad guys and stationary turrets.
What route am I going to take through this ship to get some fuel, maybe get some staples or handgun bullets?
23:46
Yeah, but the thing.
Is like if you see them but there's no way of you'll, you're going to grab everything that's on your route regardless of if it's bullets because it's there.
By the time you get to see if it's bullets or not, you're there and there's no, there's no downside for picking that up.
24:07
There's not an encumbrance.
There's not.
There's which?
I I got to say, thank God there's not encumbrance.
There's.
Yeah, no, I, I that would have been.
Dreadful.
But I I know what you're saying.
It's like you're not really making an interesting decision about like what to take There is.
24:23
Since since will, since will has been, you know, liquefied and ejected in the vacuum space and isn't here today, I have to, I have to, you know, project through the something about interesting decisions.
For sure, for sure.
And the on paper the IT does, it seems like this game should be full of interesting decisions like which which wreck which space Hulk and it's floating in the nebula.
24:51
Am I going to stop at and invest time and potentially my life in trying to get the items from and like, I, I think that's a really like cool concept for a game, but it doesn't unfortunately quite work in this one.
And that there was, as you said, it's got a bit of a tactical decision of like going in and trying to find the correct route.
25:12
And often times, you know, I would, I would go to a ship and I would, you know, go to the FTL, of course, because that's where the, that's where the fuel is.
And I do, you know, try to get to the, the helm to activate the map and, and get food, because those are those the two main things that you kind of are required to have is you, you need fuel to make your space jumps.
25:36
If not, you can't get around quickly and all your food goes away and you die and you got to have the food or else you die.
So yeah, it's again, I'm I'm super curious about the development cycle for this game.
25:53
It kind of seems like the the visuals and like the art style are intentionally kind of streamlined like they look good, but they're streamlined so that the game could have like a super massive amount of depth, but that is not there.
So I don't know again ran out of time, ran out of money etcetera etcetera.
26:11
Not sure I.
Almost feel like I, I, I think I agree.
And I almost feel like Boyd Bastards is like the tech demo set up for Wild Bastards in a way, because, and I'm hoping that this is true.
We'll find out in three days.
But from what I played of the demo for Wild Bastards, I'm like, man, yeah, this is this is like it has the great art style, has the great voice acting, voice, voice acting in Void Bastards, by the way, top notch.
26:38
Or should I say, oy, top notch.
Yeah.
And just like the sound design, I think that like it's, it's like firing on all cylinders except for like gameplay maybe or like, or like compelling gameplay.
26:55
And when I was playing wild Bastards, I'm like, OK, this has kind of like maybe a more sort of like counter strikey style duel to it as opposed to looting a ship.
But it did feel like it had more interesting decisions.
It felt like it had more of kind of a narrative drive to it.
27:13
And so I feel like the the aspect of like developing Void Bastards, they probably came up with a lot of things that they wanted to do, but we're like, maybe we should save that for the sequel.
And I'm hoping, fingers crossed, that Wild Bastards will kind of deliver on all these things that we're sort of complaining about with, you know, limited, limited options in the game.
27:36
And I think the story.
You.
Know I'm going to say like coming up coming off of Arsal the Spire episode, I think that you can get away without having you can still be a very, very, very good game without having a story, but you have to make up for it something else.
27:55
I'm fine with the game having like no story.
I feel like I'm less fine with the game having a bad story or something that like makes me feel like, well, like what was the point of that?
Where like with Slay the Spire, like that's it's the title of the game, like you, that's the your goal.
28:14
That is your thrust to do the thing.
There's not really like.
It's just it's just to give you hear your quest.
Go do it A.
A talking space whale gives you a quest and you're like, all right, Yep, can't argue with that versus not.
Not enough space whales in this space game.
28:30
I feel like is is is is there.
Like a space whale that goes and eats ships somewhere.
Yeah, you better have some tigers.
You get eaten by a space whale.
I, I was on a pretty good run and I had a lot of ammunition and I was having a good time and I was kind of hard on the looting earlier.
28:47
I I kind of enjoy the gameplay loop and the, and the that flow you get into.
But anyway, yeah, I got eaten by the whale and it does tell you like this whale eats ships, but I mean, it was in the direction I wanted to go and I'm like, oh, cool.
29:06
Like so it'll it's going to like trigger some kind of special event or like it's going to just.
Got rid of like nodes that you could go to.
No, it just it just I clicked on it and it said you have died.
I was like, well, why didn't you you've.
29:21
Been eaten by a group.
Yeah, It's like, Are you sure you want to go there?
You will die if you do that.
It's like.
Why'd you even give me the option like this?
Seems totally awesome or what?
What would be a fun idea is like, it eats ships, so then you board the whale and you have to fight yours way out of it.
Sure.
I feel like there is there's a lot of things that I wanted out of this game that I feel like the kind of the tech would probably limit it because, yeah, like first person, like a procedurally generated first person shooter environments are probably super hard to do.
29:54
And like we saw, you know, with Nightmare Reaper, the kind of style of like Void Bastards has it's, it's very deceptive in that it is a, it's a kind of like a 2.5 D game where all the all the character sprites are like the flat 2D thing, but they have so much character to them that you're just like, Oh yeah, of course that was a 3D monster that I was fighting.
30:15
I will make a.
Comment on that though is that they only have like 3 animation frames and it does become apparent after a while that is they're like they they like hover and then they they flash into their next thing and then when you kill them they like down and it's you don't notice it at first, but then later as as you defeat the same enemy over and over again, you're like you really aren't like fully animated.
30:47
You're you're key framed with nothing in between which which is the 2.5 D and it the the game does a very good job of like making you feel like it's 3D except for and those enemy sprites.
31:03
Yeah, which I think would be.
Hard on a living internal whale spaceship.
Sure.
I think the animations are, are, are fine.
What I do not think are fine is I, I, I think, well, the art might be good.
31:19
I think the character designs are all like pretty abysmal.
You mean like?
The.
Almost all of them.
The like the janitor enemy is, is like for me when it comes to FPS design, like you got to nail like your your bread and butter enemies that you're going to be seeing a lot of them.
31:40
You're going to be fighting up.
They need to be they need to look good, they need to sound good.
They got to be fun to kill and they need to be like not too hard, but not too easy.
I think the the, the cultist monks in the game of blood are like the perfect example.
31:56
It's like they are so fun to kill and they've got all sorts of fun animations, exciting stuff.
They make funny noises, but they're also like fairly capable.
So like you do need to be, you do need to run some.
Elites in Halo.
They're absolutely interesting, very distinctive 1. 100% and and as a result, it's like, well, they're not completely, you know, they're not, they're not total pushovers.
32:18
So you do feel good about having having bested them.
And I think the janitor is like a total miss.
It's this like floating guy who shoots bolts of like plasma out of his mouth or something.
And and then you've got like the the Juves, which are like these little kids who.
32:36
The voice acting is.
Good and charming, but they don't have enough lines.
They just keep saying I see a butt face or or whatever surprise butt face.
Boy, you and.
Then like the other, the other like bread and butter enemy is the tourist, which is a, a person who went out to space as a tourist and then got like, you know, stuck and infected with, with space mutation or space radiation or something and is now like this.
33:04
It's it's, it's a person with a hat and like sunglasses and like a coat like they're a tourist and they're kind of, they look kind of cute.
But here's the here's the downfall with this particular enemy design is that they're just annoying as as hell.
They explode and it's like a huge radius and it's like huge they're.
33:20
Like versus at least they're walking in a Roximity minds basically.
Yeah.
They're not super fun to fight, they're not hard, but they just make you backtrack a lot.
In my experience, my, my early playthroughs until I got like upgrades and enough ammo to deal with them.
33:38
It's like initially, I don't, I don't know about you all.
I was like, it was like playing like a survival horror game, like I didn't have enough ammunition to do anything and I couldn't be wasting bullets on on blowing up these little tourist people.
But anyway, that's that's my little, I don't know, FPS design corner.
33:58
Yeah, and I, I feel like we kind of touched on like the the crafting system and the progression unlocks of the weapons sort of being a like an anti pattern with how we've seen other rogue games do like, oh, you reroll a new character, this person has a crowbar, a a glue gun and a teleporter device or something like that.
34:23
All right, what can I, what can I do with these things throughout this run in order to be successful versus just like, Oh well, I've unlocked the the shotgun, this other thing and this other thing and I'm just going to use the shotgun the whole time.
There might, there's no, there's synergy, but there's not like synergy within your run.
34:43
It's like synergy over the entire game.
Yeah, and I'm sure that people who've beaten this on like Hard Bastard, Super Iron Man mode are just like, well, I mean, if you just unlocked the 65 weapons that are in the game, then you'll know about all the different items synergies, which is probably fair.
35:00
But I don't think the game delivers that incentive early enough to players.
Where This is why we saw the the average player has about 13 hours in this game.
Is that.
Yeah, like I could totally see you play like 10 hours of this guy.
All right, I got it.
35:15
I'm going to go play Spelunky for another 75 hours straight.
But very possible possible.
Aren't there that many guns?
Surely not there I.
Thought there?
Well, there's, there's guns and there's also equipment, right You have.
35:32
Like 3 item slots, yeah.
You have like 3 item slots and I'm trying to click around to find the answer to this, but I think it was like, I don't know, like an 8 by 8 grid of stuff and yeah, here, here we go.
We got 123456.
35:47
Wait 123. 37 things it's.
A yeah, like a 7 by 7 grid of things like the rift hunter or well, I guess to be clear, half of these aren't weapons.
Some of these, so like for example, your your bread and butter, your pistol that you start with has a, an add on called the bullet hunter, which at first I was like, OK, great, this is going to make like my bullets curve around doors or like it's going to make my, my gun like shoot through walls and stuff that I believe unlocks the ability for you to find bullets in your later runs.
36:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
I I do remember that actually.
That node, yeah.
And I, I remember unlocking that.
I'm like OK and.
I felt well, I, I just wanted to, I guess talk about the weapons and the potential of synergies.
I I found two things that you could maybe call synergies, which were the throwing a a grenade, a bushwhack, as they call it, a mine onto a turret and then shooting said mine with my gun to set it off.
37:02
And then the other one was switching to the the Taser, the electric weapon and tasering a robot and then switching to my shotgun and getting close and shotgunning it.
So I mean there there are like some combos to be had in those things were like, you know, fun to do.
37:20
Or you ZAP, you ZAP the turret, then you go up and you reprogram the turret so it's on your side.
This is true and then.
You lure an enemy into it like that's OK.
That was like some interesting, fun gameplay.
Totally.
That that is the first couple times you do that is neat.
This is true.
37:36
It's just unfortunately those like interactions between the systems aren't quite I I feel like they need to be a little bit deeper and they're like fun like little.
And for a game that takes place in space, barely any amount of, like, shunting enemies out of airlocks, which, yeah, what was the.
37:54
Point of the of the airlock thing.
Can you lure people?
Into the air.
The point of the airlocks is you get you can get the gun that lets you suck them up and like put them into void space and then you unvoid them into the airlock and then you can blast them out into space.
38:10
I.
See, I think that is a great example.
So sometimes in your randomly generated ship layout of a ship that you dock onto, which is I I done pretty seamlessly and pretty well.
And I think it's good and it is very difficult to do, especially in like an FPS to like make the, the level design interesting when it's done like randomly.
38:29
So sometimes in your random layout you get a room with like a, a airlock chamber all like alien or aliens and you can press a button and anything in the chamber gets shot at into space.
But like generally there's I think that's just a good example of like, I'm sure they had grander plans for that and that they were going to figure out more ways to to utilize that other than enemies that just happened to spawn already in there and waiting for you to airlock out into space and enemies that could be placed there with the with the void gun that you're describing, Colin.
39:06
A very common tactical maneuver in Heat Signature is to like grab your objective and then throw yourself out the airlock or or like shoot out a window and jump out the spaceship and then detach, like remotely detach your your spaceship and have it come and like rendezvous with you and pick you up.
39:24
I think like 50 like 50% of all missions that I do in Heat's signature are like that.
And it's just like, it feels so good.
And I feel like this game is just like, you know, there there's so much you could do in this space.
And that's why I think that like, wild bastards might might be better because it's maybe more grounded in like in that kind of possibility space.
39:47
We're like, oh, yeah, you're just like, you're on a planet.
OK, great.
You don't have to worry about oxygen.
You don't have to worry about all these other wacky systems.
Again to be clear, I I never worried about oxygen.
I think this would be mechanic.
So are there Is there a map in in Wild Bastards?
40:04
There's yeah, there's the a ship map that when you first talk, I mean, that's the first thing that I check whenever I first dock onto another thing, where's the helm?
Where's the main computer so I can download all the loot locations of the loot and well, I guess yeah.
40:20
You also have your like your FTL node traversal map.
But like the ship map itself is, is interesting because it has like, you know, a randomly kind of like laid out.
I think there's some like pre predefined ship designs, but like generally randomly connected things between like your generator, your atmosphere zone, your, your hab, your theater, all sorts of things were like in those zones.
40:46
I guess maybe you need those, those unlocks in order to reliably find like the the bullets and sandwiches in them.
But you go in there and, you know, like some of the doors might be locked, some of like the power might be out in parts of the ship or the whole ship.
41:02
And there's, I think like the game does a pretty good job of like that kind of thematic element of like, all right, I'm boarding the ship.
There's no like power to any of the doors.
They're all wide open.
I can't close any of them until, until I put the power back on.
But if I turn the power back on, then the turrets are going to come back online.
41:20
There's some like, there's some good amount of decision making there.
But yeah, I mean, I really just wanted to be able to like, oh, man, All right.
I've, I've hacked into the security camera system on the opposite side of the ship.
I'll make like a thunking noise to draw all the enemies over, and then I'll sneak around them to get to the power lockout and lock them all into that room.
41:41
And then I'll just like, set up some explosives and blow off that part of the ship.
Like heat signature has just ruined me for those kinds of expectations.
Whereas with this like, you know, I I'm not saying that this holy.
Moly.
Yeah, I know.
I I'm not saying this game needs it, but that's like when you're saying something is an immersive SIM that's kind of like, yeah, I mean, like that's at least that's, that's the kind of like options that I want.
42:07
And I feel like even even Prey had that kind of stuff of like, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to like spec my character in this direction.
And then like, yeah, I'm going to be like this stealthy cyber hacker or I'm just going to be like a brutish, like melee punisher kind of thing.
42:24
And yeah, like different game budgets, of course.
But yeah, I mean.
I'm going to say the same thing that like I say, for solo dev efforts, like, well, if you can't, if you can't manage your ambition to do it, then you shouldn't do it.
42:40
Well, if if you're if you're, if your studio isn't going to have the budget to make to implement the things that you need to have a fun game, then you should make a different game.
They.
Yeah, I guess.
You don't know if it's going to be 1/2 baked idea until like halfway through development though.
Fair, fair.
42:56
Well, OK, fine.
You're you're around to it, but I don't have to like it.
That's.
True.
No, you do have to like it.
That's.
That's true.
That's true.
You've.
Changed my mind.
Indeed, the game sort of, I don't know, seems to I don't know if it necessarily like promises like, hey, this is going to be an immersive SIM where you can, you know, do all this wild, wacky, cool stuff and like really creatively come up with ways to use the environment and your tools against the enemies.
43:30
I don't know if it necessarily is making that promise, but like a lot of a lot about the game suggests that that was in the design document that was like and that they didn't quite get it get it done like they couldn't even get the windows to work properly.
43:46
You can't jump through windows consistently.
Like what what is going on there?
I just stopped trying to even go through windows.
All right, I'm, I'm a little bit curious about y'all's early game experience because my experience was like, I ran out of ammo immediately.
And, and I, I yeah, I ran out.
44:04
I ran out of bullets immediately.
And so I was having to like run around enemies instead of shooting the little exploding tourist guys.
I had to like trigger them and then run as quickly as possible and jump at the last minute to get out of the range.
Very unpleasant.
44:22
But yeah, so I ran out of ammo.
And then I was in this horrible loop of, like, trying to find ammunition, not really wanting to engage with the game stealth mechanics because I found them incredibly boring.
And yeah, and it wasn't until I got enough unlocks and got enough additional health and some better weapons and more weapons and started getting into runs where I was able to, like, go to shops and buy a bunch of ammo.
44:51
It wasn't until I started stockpiling ammo and upgrades that I started having fun with the game.
And I was like.
Two hours in, 2-3 hours in, I feel like I.
Had a a the opposite experience.
I mean I I I did have the the tension of ammo which did force me to change my gameplay style.
45:12
I was initially just run and gun and shoot at them until they die.
And it was a little bit more like stealth pop pop run away.
If you see like the big enemies, just run, do not engage.
But I maybe I just got one of the ships that provides a lot of ammo pretty early because I felt like I enjoyed the that that the early tension.
45:37
And then as I started to get some of the upgrades, I was like, well, I'm not.
The upgrades made me better at the game, but did not satisfy me.
Like this isn't making me play differently.
It's just making like the game is getting easier from this perspective, but then the enemies are getting slightly tougher and it's we're going in lockstep and therefore I'm not like changing anything there.
46:06
Was there was one funny aspect where I was on one ship?
Like very survival horary trying to hideaway from like the the steps.
But like, again, the sound design in this game is great 'cause you can like like 3D auto, like audio, like pinpoint where in the next room, like the enemy is walking around like, OK, I know he's going to be coming around that corner.
46:30
And then I'll try to like sneak stealth my way around the other way.
And like in one vessel playing like very strategic and stealth oriented.
And then then in the next vessel, I was like random, like trying to unload as many bullets into this barking dog robot as I possibly could, trying to get it to to drop its loot stuff.
46:48
And I just thought that like this is, this is a very funny visual of me just like chasing this barking dog like bam, bam, bam.
And yeah, I think that like there were there were elements where the, the limited ammunition had me making decisions of like, OK, do I take the poison dart gun this time?
47:08
Or do I take a shotgun?
Do I take the the grenades?
Do I take this other thing?
And I think that like that was, that was OK, but it wasn't I, I, I wanted that the engineer level decision making of like, aha, yes, I can construct a thing to like block off passages or hack into stuff.
47:32
And it just felt it felt more shootery as opposed to cause like in Dave's acts or other M SIM games.
But you have those options.
You have that like, you know, I'm going to I'm going to just like spider man my way around the ship and try to like cling to the ceiling and avoid everybody in this mission or I'm going.
47:50
To sneak through the air ducts, yeah.
Yeah, like the fact that there's no air ducts or like there.
Are there are, but there There are a few, but there's not really that's not expensive enough to be a viable way to play the game and you.
Would think if you're just running on your own personal oxygen, you could just like clamber around the outside of the ship until you got to a window and then like shoot through it and then get into the ship that way.
48:13
But anyway, that's.
Way outside of scope now.
OK, well, interesting.
OK, so at least you know, we were the game did support a few different play styles kind of sort of ish because our early game experiences were very different.
Now you're talking about how like the equipment doesn't really the equipment in the unlocks you both mentioned do not encourage like a new gameplay styles, new new strategies and things.
48:40
That's that is I think in my experience was pretty true.
But something that I did want to mention that I think the game does pretty well is that when you generate, when you get assigned a new character, I think you get like different starting resources.
48:57
I didn't notice a huge difference.
But more importantly, you get different starting DNA, gene, genetic traits, genetic works.
And I applaud the game for having little random quirks that actually make a tangible gameplay difference.
49:17
And they.
Yeah, actually.
And they were interesting.
They and they were interesting, like I was telling you about how frustrated I was getting with not having enough ammunition to deal with the exploding tourists and having trouble dodging their abilities.
I eventually in my early runs got a random trade which was does not trigger tourist explosions I.
49:41
Was like what A?
Godsend, this is incredible.
This is so useful.
This is so helpful and and so that was that was fun.
Some other specific traits to call out.
There's a there are different heights.
Yeah.
Did you?
I was gonna.
Ask did you get the short short?
I got the.
Odd.
Yeah, I got the odd job.
49:57
Rd. also and there.
Was the tall height and like it's simple but it makes a significant difference your perspective in the 3D environment and like wow, it was so.
Startling when I finally died on the short guy run and I went to the next run.
I'm like.
Oh, whoa, wait my.
50:13
Perspective is substantially different I.
I found myself once I got to the like four or five hour mark and I was starting to get to this really fun like FPS and looting flow.
I found myself longing for the shortest stature trait because I thought it might make Bunny hopping better because the because I was Bunny hopping around and in certain rooms you hit the ceiling and it like slows you down.
50:42
So I'd like to, I'd like to experiment with that at some point.
What else?
There's a trait that highlights loot like there's, there's, there's specific like loot nodes on the map where which are outlined in like green, as you say, like the different chests and things and lockers and pieces of luggage.
51:00
There's also just randomly sitting on the ground.
And if that's less noticeable, so there's there's a trait that highlights it and there's something else here about now that all that being said, the absolute worst trait in my opinion to get is the color blind trait, because then you cannot see those green.
Oh.
51:15
No.
Oh, I never got.
That one that sounds beautiful.
I got that one several times and it just makes the world black and white and it was like, Oh no.
So I I appreciate that the game did that and it's also fun that randomly generates the cougher.
Or what is it smoker or coughing, right?
51:31
And that one was.
That one, I thought that was really interesting.
Like it.
Absolutely messes up trying to do stealth stuff.
The thought was like, oh, this, That's where that's what frustrated me because I was like, OK, this is something that could drive a different type of gameplay.
51:50
It's like an anti synergy which forces you to go down a certain path, but then they don't build on it because there's not really a way to like change out your kit.
It's like, well, it drives me to like pick different weapons when you start off from the ship.
I guess it would.
Be better I think as like an item that like you start with like you start with cigarettes that you can use to identify like laser grids or things like the very Metal Gear Solid scenario, but it makes some cough just.
52:17
Something that interacts with it in a way like the different.
It's like, oh, it's like this very interesting trait that changes your gameplay style, but then there's no way for you to react to it.
Right.
There's no decision that's based off of that, except for I guess I'm going to shoot more because now stealth thing is less effective.
52:36
Indeed, yeah.
I, I, I agree.
I agree.
I do wish that there was a little more, a little more depth with that.
It's unfortunate.
I mean, I and I, I, gosh, I wasn't even thinking about that, like until you until you mentioned it.
52:54
There's very little what what is the term for this?
Like your drops in forming your strategy.
Like you having to make interesting strategic decisions based on what you are randomly assigned or what you randomly come across, I mean.
I feel like in other games I'd end up calling it synergy eventually, but I feel like it doesn't quite get to the level of.
53:15
Synergy and, and we were talking about it, even though I complained about how I felt the synergies were kind of camouflaged and hidden.
We were talking about it all over the last episode where it's like you're on a run and you, you get a specific selection of cards and go, oh, I'm going to, or a specific relic.
53:31
And now I got to do a Chevron.
Now I got to do a, a poison run, etcetera, etcetera.
And those types of moments in a, in a run are exciting and fortunately not, not quite here.
Did either of you get to, I think I got to Nebula Level 3 baby.
53:56
But I, I embarrassingly like it didn't get many of the key quest items.
And I kind of expected that.
Well, when I get when I assemble the ID card, surely I'll go back to the hab or whatever and they'll be like some sort of a bespoke story section or like a special event that some kind of.
54:18
Breather sequence and like.
At least there was like a cinematic, so that's something.
But I was thinking about Will discussed a while back about there being bespoke sections in Seven Days to Die where it's like here's like, you know, sort of a tailor made cool cinematic sequence, like a set piece section.
54:40
And I was expecting I was hoping for something like that.
And at some point, Scott, you sent us like a little review about void bastards that sort of eliminated that.
Apparently there's nothing like that.
There are like special random events where it's like, oh, pirates show up or oh, the security bot has been activated and we'll end your life shortly.
54:57
Thank you for your understanding.
And those that stuff is like cool when you're on the ship and like unexpected things happen that do make you change your plans, which is great.
But apparently there's no like boss battles or, or anything or like special like I was, I was hoping for like milestone ship encounters of some kind, which I guess don't exist.
55:19
And that's very disappointing to know.
I feel like this game is is the other side of the coin from our Lone Star episode where that game was like it was nothing.
It was just like the boss battles effectively.
And you had like, you know, you had some like interesting spins on the FTL style, like non combat event encounters.
55:39
I mean, there's like there's basically no ADVENT encounters in this game.
But whereas Lone Star, I feel like the art style was a little, I don't know, like not there yet or like not engaging.
The art style here is super engaging, but the gameplay really isn't there.
And so I feel like if you just combined those two games together somehow into some, you know, Unholy Trinity or Unholy Duality, then like then yeah, like it would be, it would be something cool 'cause like, yeah, I was, I was super pumped.
56:07
Hey, I've I missed getting the the first Mac Guffin thing the first time because I had like a split path where like one path was going to go down into a mine.
And if I did that I would die, which again is another problem that I have.
It's like, give me give me some like way to like strategize around that, right?
56:25
Like even if.
Your strategy around that, Just make sure that you have enough health not to die, yeah.
But I don't think that's as interesting as like a pop up.
That's like, all right, you've you've landed on the mine thing or you've entered the minefield.
Are you going to like, you know, you have a one in five chance of making it through which path are you going to pick?
56:43
Like click, click, click, click.
Oh, you know, through the thank, thank the dice rolls that I got through.
But like in the in the node traversal thing here, there's confusingly like.
Well, yeah, I don't know, like I misread the map and I thought I.
57:01
Could go back.
And I couldn't and I was like, God damn it.
So I restarted and then I finally got to the Mac Guffin of Act one, picked it up.
I'm like, all right, something's going to happen.
You know, I think it played like one of the like the comic book style things of like the stuff popping up, which is neat.
57:17
It's fun, it's cool.
But I'm like, all right, now what?
Like I'm going to go back to the ship and do something.
And then I just kept exploring and then I kept going to the second Mac Guffin.
I picked that one up and it was the same kind of deal.
And I'm like, all right, what are we building up to here?
57:34
And yeah, there's no big boss fight.
There's no big bad it really.
Killed my motivation.
When you posted that, I was like, oh, this is it.
This is this is all we're getting, Yeah.
Like like I'm, isn't it kind of a no brainer to be like, well, at least, you know, once you collect all the FTL parts and you get all of the bureaucratic items that you need, your ID card and your printers and etcetera, etcetera.
57:58
Like it feels like a no brainer to bastard.
You have to fight the void bastard or you have to be on the ship and like guard it from an attack while.
TL.
Powers up right like that's that's like so obvious that's like the default option and it's up to you game designers to do something interesting with that or come up with something else interesting, but it's a.
58:20
Decision.
It's just like that at this point.
Yeah, and again, feels like they're right out of time.
Yeah, I mean, there's there's some good ideas here with like space pirates.
I think that the space pirates kind of allude to some sort of story element of like, you know, you have to imagine that I'm I'm from God.
58:40
What is what is the what is the Lemis show bus?
You have to imagine that I'm from Yolka and you know, I'm a I'm a space, I'm a space pirate and that the space pirates elude that you know, Oi, what's going to happen when the when I'm glad that no, no, people from from Scotland are listening at this point because they've all tuned out after the the first bad impression that we tried doing, but bad.
59:12
Oh, come on, you know the what?
What's going to happen when the when the main space vessel that you're the player characters and.
They're like.
You know, they're going to fond us and and blow us to, you know, bits they are.
59:30
And I'm like, OK, that's like, that's some kind of story thing, but like, right.
Sure.
They they are invested in keeping you here.
Yeah.
Like, shouldn't the pirates have more of an outsized impact on like the gameplay and stuff?
But, you know, they just, they just kind of show up to, to wreck stuff every so often.
59:49
And they and they absolutely wrecked me like the one proper pirate encounter I had.
I was shocked.
It's like how tough the only way to.
Win is not to play with Pirates.
Yeah, and I, I, I really should have hoofed it.
I tried to I, I had the heartbeat update, so like or upgrade.
1:00:07
So I got killed once and then when I came back, I was like time to run.
But they were very quick and that kind of stuff, those random events and stuff.
I I I so appreciate and a rogue a game.
The one random event I don't like is that sometimes you'll be on your way to the exit after having looted and then suddenly the power on the ship will go out and you have to go all the way back to the power area.
1:00:28
You got to backtrack.
It's like the worst type of FPS backtracking, backtrack and reactivate the power.
And then and sometimes occasionally it's interesting because there's a few enemies that you left or whatever, but like, please give me like a little countdown or something and that would be exciting.
Like, oh, the power is going to go down in 10 seconds.
1:00:44
I really got to move it to the to the exit or whatever.
Yeah, so.
So at the end.
So there you have it.
And I was excited to try.
At a certain point I'm like, OK, I got to try.
Wild bastards.
I know there's a demo around here somewhere.
Let me find it.
Hope it's gone.
Well, you got three days before it before it comes out.
1:01:01
All right.
I've got, I've, I've got my new Scottish accent here going.
Yes, Sir.
Let's rock'n'roll Boyd.
Bastards pirate take one.
What the holy fuck is that box unit?
Burn the stuff.
It has those bastards cocked and doesn't make any sense.
1:01:18
And then voice line #2 take number take #1 it's a box unit.
It'll be sending the pull halfway off to final Fancy.
We did a little brush the teeth.
What a soon.
Outstanding, outstanding.
I appreciate a bit of none of that's.
1:01:35
Gonna come through on the audio.
It's gonna come.
I didn't.
I didn't catch, I did not pick up on that world building.
So yeah, it's, it's too bad.
But hey, we have sort of a pseudo #2 coming here soon.
So that's, that's swell, Yeah.
And I'm excited to see like more of the synergies involved there because like I think like on on any given one of like little combat missions, you, you can like flip back and forth between two different hero units and like, like, OK, I'm going to be like the the spider lady here.
1:02:04
And then I'm going to switch to like the sniper horse guy.
And like the character designs are just they're so hilarious.
I feel like Boyd Bastards has has done a pretty good job in the art department, but I think wild bastards.
I realize this isn't a review or preview of Wild Bastards or real quick, sorry.
1:02:19
So you can you you before you start a mission, you select two of the wild bastards.
Is that you?
Your goal is to kind of like traverse traverse space while being haunted by a a space fuck boy essentially.
1:02:36
And your goal is to kind of like collect your scattered crew throughout throughout this throughout space, throughout the Badlands, as it were.
I see and.
Then mid mission, mid level you can switch, yeah.
Like you can.
It's like it's almost like you're switching weapons in a way and like you are, you are in like you're OK, like you're in the same spot and you like, you know, you flip between like spider lady or horseman, spider lady or horseman and like depending if you're going to like round the corner to try to like, you know, it's it does feel very it has a kind of like more of like a strategic dual aspect to it as opposed to like a spaceship style stealth action sequence.
1:03:16
So I'm excited.
I think it I'm hope I'm fingers crossed that wild bastards will kind of like capitalize on all the stuff that we're thinking like it's, you know, the gameplay's sort of missing here from from void mastards.
I think there's potential there.
I'll.
1:03:31
Let you test that out for me.
We'll have to see how the how the reviews roll in.
And Speaking of reviews, maybe, maybe I'll kick us off here this time.
Please do it in the accent though.
1:03:49
Void.
Bastards for DD we'll we'll channel DD from Let me show Void Bastards.
I'm going to give a 6.5 about the same as void bastards, 6.5 about the same as nightmare Reaper.
1:04:06
I feel like really great art.
I think the, the general flow of getting into a ship and running around for 5 minutes and looting stuff is fun, but I don't really know that it does much more than that.
1:04:25
It's fun for that kind of 5 minutes, but I don't know that it really has that kind of lasting engagement to it.
The crafting system I'm mixed on.
I think the ship environments are well done, but they signed you kind of kind of start to see the patterns after a while and you're like, OK, I mean, it's it's well done, but it's, I don't know, it's it feels like it's lacking variety in a way.
1:04:49
I didn't like the turrets at all.
I know that there's ways to like counter those later, but I felt really hamstrung by them and not having the kind of strategic options that I wanted.
Yeah, I kept thinking that I would be wanted to be playing wild bastards instead, but instead I just wanted to be playing heat signature.
1:05:05
I think.
Stay tuned.
And 1/2 for sure.
And yeah, I think that like, you know, this game, this game isn't a 10 out of 10.
I think it's totally, totally fine for what it's going for.
And yeah, I think it's it's a perfectly OK game.
1:05:21
And lots of games are going to be perfectly OK games.
Not everyone's going to be a Titanic, generational, genre defining moment, and that's OK.
Maybe Wild Bastards will be that.
We'll have to wait and see you in three days.
I'll go next.
I'm going to give it a six.
1:05:39
It just, it just didn't catch me.
Like it looks really cool and interesting from the first like half an hour to an hour, but it just kind of didn't.
1:05:56
There was not anything that pulled me beyond that.
Like I kept waiting for there to be like the second act, but it was just the first act again.
And I was, I'll say that I think the thing that really got me was the fact that when you die, it does not feel different.
1:06:16
And so like, you know, I did a couple of runs and then like I got to some point where I was just like, cool.
So I guess I just do the same thing again.
And and then Scott posted the thing in our little discord about like, there's not a final, like you're not building to anything.
1:06:34
I'm like, I don't, I don't feel compelled to play this more, which has pretty damning criticism because it's like, well, that's the only reason I'm doing this.
Like I guess for the podcast, but like, I'm not going to if if I don't feel like I don't want to play a game more because I'm bored or uninterested by it, then yeah.
1:06:57
But it is very, it's very cool looking.
Like I have a couple of small criticisms for the like animation of the enemies and and some of the animation, like I don't think the enemies were quite as distinctive as I wanted them to be, but I really like the aesthetic of the ship itself.
1:07:18
The like cell ish 3D ish hardline cartoon stuff I think is really cool.
And I feel like it's a large style that I want more games to adopt.
I guess that might take away some of the visual impact of it because it's so unique, but I like that a lot.
1:07:40
But that's not enough to build a game off of.
So 6 good enough.
If you really into like shooting and scooting around you might enjoy this game, but it didn't quite have enough depth for me.
OK, so this game I picked this game not so much.
1:08:00
I don't think I felt too much into the trap of me seeing a game and my brain auto assembling like my expectation of it.
I because part of the reason we talked about the marketing is very good.
1:08:18
The trailer does kind of suggest like, oh, you're going to have to make you know, these, these important decisions about where you loot and how long you loot for and when you need to call it quits, like when you need to stop rolling the dice and stop risking your run in your loot and make a run for the for for the to get back to the the airlock to get back to your ship.
1:08:41
I think that idea is there.
It's really cool.
And while there was a little bit of decision making about which node to go to next on the map and where to loot next, that decision wasn't quite significant enough.
And I wish it'd been pushed a little further.
1:08:58
Wish the immersive SIM elements have been pushed a little further.
As I mentioned, I did have an enjoyable time playing this game, but I don't I don't think the way I was enjoying it is how the designers intended.
I found at a certain point that it was definitely itching, scratching the itch, the FPS meathead itch of Bunny hopping around, going as quickly as possible shooting things and clicking on often times enemies to to click on click on enemy heads to head shot them, but also clicking on buttons.
1:09:35
Importantly, to go through most of the doors in this game you do not click use on the actual door.
You have to click use on a button to the right of the door and that flow states of switching to the right weapon and attacking the enemies and then looking around and finding that loot and picking it up and then Bunny hopping some more.
1:10:02
And oh, I'm getting shot at by a turret and turning, whipping my camera around and clicking on the door to open it and to jump through out of the way of that turret shooting me was pretty satisfying.
And I think frankly, I'll probably play play the game a bit more, I suspect.
1:10:21
So all that to say, in your game that features a first person perspective and shooting when opening doors is the thing scratching the PSH.
That is a problem because as I mentioned, I do not like the enemy to sign in this game.
1:10:40
Thankfully when you kill them, a lot of them give apart in an enjoyable way, which is which is good.
That does help.
But a while back we're talking about how in an FPS game, your hands and your and your guns are extremely important because in a way that is your the representation of your character in the game world.
1:11:04
And it's super important that the weapons look good, feel good, and are, you know, fun to use because you know you are that is how you're interacting with the game world.
Is that your primary ways that you're shooting at things and you're talking about the the the trouble with the enemies not having many frames of animation?
1:11:25
Well, the guns have about two and I literally 2 And that is unacceptable, positively unacceptable 4.
Frames would have been the the the difference maker.
AB Absolutely.
They kind of wobble around a little bit as you're kind of moving, which is like good enough.
1:11:42
But I mean, come ONS have the have an artist, you know, take their lunch break order in, sit down, add a few more frames and make that stuff, you know, satisfying to use.
1:11:57
If you're if you're not going to make it a satisfying like looting and decision making experience that you got to make the shooting, you got to make the shooting enjoyable.
So anyway, so void bastards is coming down on my list as 4.5.
1:12:14
It's just ahead of it's just ahead of one way heroics, which I think one of my heroics is probably a better, like total package.
It just so happens that I'm more into FPS games than I am RPGs.
And there you have it.
1:12:30
I am the the game is not so bad.
The game the game definitely is good enough that I'm very much looking forward to Wild Bastards.
So I have also high hopes.
Yeah, I think some my similar games list here I've sort of put out into into two groups and one is like the immersive SIM rogue like experience group and the other one is like actually good like shooter shooter rogue games, which is a growing list.
1:12:59
Like it didn't used to be this way, but we're getting some we're getting some quality titles here.
So immersive SIM group we have we've mentioned Wild Bastards is coming up in a couple days here.
Fingers crossed.
Heat signature.
I talked a lot about space beast terror Fright I think is supposed to be interesting.
1:13:18
Or it's a much more aliens oriented FPS style.
Derelict crawler.
You got Duskers, which is you are controlling robots in a derelict vessel then Like no jumping to different derelicts, but you're controlling them through like a command line to interface, which is it's a very it's almost like a text adventure game in a way, which is very interesting.
1:13:43
And then two like AAA entries into this one is an actual DLC for Prey that we mentioned before called Prey Moon Crash.
And this is I think this kind of started the shooter, the FPS like big budget shooter Rogue foray in a way.
1:14:05
I don't know if it's the best roguelike experience per SE, but also it's it kind of prerequisites you having to know like the systems of the of the base game in order to really come to grips with it.
But anyway, that and death Loop, which is put out by I think Arcane Studios who put out Dishonored.
1:14:27
It's like, yeah, both of those like AAA level experiences.
I believe those are supposed to be like very in semi, but maybe a little bit longer of of your your standard run.
Now for roguelike shooter games the thing that come to mind the most for me here is Roboquest which with has the like the cell shading much more 3DA lot higher frame rate doom style mechanics and importantly you have the when you shoot the gun the little Pew Pew letters appeared next to the next to the muzzle a very important gunfire reborn which is like a Co-op animal shooter with magic powers.
1:15:15
You got fury unleashed, which I have it on this list and why did I put it on here?
There's a good reason why I put it on here.
Oh yeah, this is like it's like a Metal Slug style running gun shooter, which I think is supposed to be neat and interesting.
1:15:33
I don't know that belongs to the first anyway mortal sin you should check out that one is actually like a very interesting like almost Dark Souls style first person like melee combat system and we couldn't we couldn't end this without talking about the Andrew Harshman simulator mullet mad Jack, which is a a 90s long haired bemulleted anime YouTube influencer Roe billionaire killing simulator for.
1:16:10
For for the audience listening at home, Andrew merely has long hair, not a mullet.
Yes, but I'm also sure after I play.
Mullimad Jack, though I'll be headed to the barbershop.
Andrew also drives around in a in a early 90s Ferrari and has a cyberpunk sunglasses that he wears.
1:16:29
Indeed, his cool Cortana leather jacket.
Well.
The way I was describing, the way I was playing the game, you know, speed running around and jumping everywhere.
I think, yeah, I got to check out Mullimad Jack, which is all about speed, speed, speed.
You got to get to the level as quick as possible.
I did not know it had rogue elements.
Yeah.
It is.
1:16:45
It is a much more palatable version of post void that I tried playing for 30 seconds and almost almost had an aneurysm playing.
It was like it was just so visually just like not disturbing but just like what if.
What if like TV static was a video game and like that with like like like flashes and everything Anyway, mullet mad Jack.
1:17:09
Much better experience, arguably faster even somehow.
Yeah, give give some of those 25 games that I just mentioned a look through.
But yeah, that's going to do it for our Void Bastards episode.
1:17:25
We're going to close up the airlock on this one, and we're going to jump deep into the warped nether reaches of the nebula for a drum roll, please.
A Scott pick of bump up a bump inscription.
Spooktober is coming a little early this year with a game that I think genre bends the definition of what is rogue light and rogue light or whatever to the extreme.
1:17:54
And very importantly, if you're hearing this, like I think I've heard about it in scription before, you should, as Colin has pointed out repeatedly, do not look up anything about this game.
Yeah, I'm gonna.
I'm gonna spoil, spoil.
1:18:10
I'm pretty sure I I so I've played through it.
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna give it a 9.5.
But it is, it's very good and it's better if you know less about the game and.
I will say this, having just beaten it again a couple days ago, it does.
1:18:27
It does hold up on a second playthrough.
But yes, the the I think like a full like point of that 9.5 is from like the first, the first playthrough experience and just yeah.
So, Andrew, you got some homework duly.
Noted.
All right.
1:18:44
But yeah, thank you for the.
Reminder that'll.
Be our our horror show for next episode and to play us out from this one, we're going to have some tunes as your oxygen is running low and that derelict scrap heap you've looted is now being boarded by menacing pirates fresh off of the streets.
