[Music] foreign friends and welcome to yet another episode of the going rogue gaming podcast a roguelike podcast where we talk about roguelike games [Music] The Grog pod uh I am your host a stack of villager cards in a trench coat Scott burger and I'm joined by my Rogues gallery of co-hosts as always I'm the low brow warrior with a giant Club ready to beat you who will right and I am Colin Smith a large stack of apples

today we're talking about stack lands the the game made by four developers from I'm gonna I I looked at the pronunciation guide for this too uh correct Utrecht is that this is is that passing everyone's Netherlands oh yeah yeah uh Utrecht Netherlands uh yeah developed by a group of four guys that call themselves The Sock pop collective oh they're from the direct icy yes yes um and from what I can tell about this developer they they develop a lot of games they develop a whole lot of games I don't know how super deep any of their games are except for this one that we're talking about today uh but we'll get into it uh stack land released April 8th 2022 you can find it on Steam and oh itch.io or ichio I guess people call it uh this one I think people are gonna raise eyebrows at this uh rolls in at the 56th most popular roguelike on Steam yep there goes Will's eyebrows as predicted 15 100 168 total reviews and the 97th percentile it within the whole distribution Cullen unfortunately you have too many cards in your hand and you have to sell them and by sell them I mean you have to describe this game in one sentence

uh it is a game where you stack up cards in quotes uh to make things slowly over time resource Gathering building game not really like comma come on come on run on run on uh well so I might I might fight you a little bit about roguelike versus non roguelike uh uh on this one but but yeah like this is this is a game that is it fair to call this a survival game like a survival farming game that's fair is it yeah I feel like it fits it's like halfway between a survival farming game and one of the like Idol games like uh like did you ever play that game where you like make all of the paper clips and you turn the entire University it reminded me a little bit of that but with like more of a manual dexterity aspect of it uh there's a lot of like build your engine aspect of it I feel like it was it was an engine building game yeah per second that had that had uh a survival aspect to it as well yeah in this game I think this this game is super interesting on multiple levels for me anyway because I think I'm I'm like the stickler of our group where anytime like people are super hyped up to play like survival games like the forest and or Don't Starve I'm kind of like but somehow I've been like weirdly engrossed by this game I think I might be like the like the weird reverse outlier for this one versus those others uh and so describing describing stack lands it's a very cute very much card game you boot it up uh and you're greeted with a uh a booster pack I think is your first item that and all you can do is you click on it it gives you your your starting cards that really kind of uh set the table as it were uh for what's to come and that is cards cards cards cards cards cards you got all kinds of things I think the first things that that kind of pop out from from that first booster pack are like something like a tree a berry bush uh you know just sort of like basic starting resources that you use to to like put like villager card onto wood to create stick kind of thing and for me this is the kind of stuff that sort of like drives me up a wall with like your standard survival crafting games but there's something about like about this that feels different enough that I'm kind of kind of vibing with it pretty hard did you guys have any any like immediate reactions to to like this sort of style of gameplay

had a quick chat about this and I think if I'm this is like last week and I think if I'm remembering correctly it was something along the lines of this didn't feel like a card game at all which is funny because you were just saying it's very much a car I mean that's the only thing in the game is cards right but the cards didn't feel like they could have been tokens they could have been just been little like pieces on a board like the fact that it was a card and you could set it on top of another card didn't really do much for me it could have also just been here's a circle like token and you're gonna take your little like you know your little piece and put it on top of it and then you're gonna watch a progress bar I mean like the card element is just like you know it lends to stack lands which I think it's reminiscent of uh Flatlands is that that does that sound about right or like I don't know that's there's a book called Flatlands uh flatland do you do well that's on about like two-dimensional beings or something yeah yeah I don't know why I just for some reason like it felt like a very like it was somewhat related in the sense that it was like oh yeah I have two flat universes and like the universe is a universe of cards and it's like a very much and it's not it doesn't it's not a very doesn't make a lot of sense this universe but it does within you know it within itself um but uh no I uh I uh I thought it was a lot of watching progress bars and uh I I think it's funny that you were so into this one or this is the first time hearing of it whereas yeah like I Love Don't Starve I did love the forest I loved A lot of these survival crafting but like those games there's tension there's constant tension in the universe and if you're not doing your build order right then you can like get punished whereas this game is like oh well I guess I some die dude died to starvation I Gotta Wait Another like five minutes for another dude to get created let me just watch that progress bar and it just didn't feel like attention wasn't as real for me yeah it's definitely not a tense game uh I I found it I I liked it I found it to be a a Zen type of game where you're just kind of like you're not feeling stressed pretty much ever and I guess sometimes I guess if you're fighting stuff uh you there's like a spike of tension but most of the time it's just like casually slowly building your way up towards a more efficient Village but uh and trying to like move your cards around and like I I feel like the further on in the game the less it felt like specifically card based anything uh the most card driven aspect of it was the literal booster packs they called them card packs and it's uh the randomly generated items that you get out of them and sometimes you get the rare thing and sometimes you know you get uh what you want sometimes you you just get to know the rock or whatever um which that was like a very card themed thing but pretty much the goal of the game for my playthrough was to make it so that I never have to buy those anymore you try and get consistent sources of re or sources of resources and get it to the point where those are a bad way of getting anything like there's nothing in them that's good enough that you keep buying those things and [Music] you don't shuffle your cards ever so it's a game for you okay this is a game of self-reliance then and the attempt to become self-reliant and not yeah I mean like like a lot of the the survival farming type games it's uh you're trying to gain resources and you're trying to build something that's like a self-producing thing that you're not like huntering and Gathering um

I I think that you could have like I enjoyed it I think I could have enjoyed it the same amount if it was tokens or if it were as a 3D thing where you're living on a little island um I don't think it would have fundamentally changed the gameplay in a lot of ways uh so I I feel like they they started off real strong on the like this is cards and this is stacks of cards but I don't think that it really did anything with that in terms of like changing the gameplay radically they didn't even have very many card based puns like come on right actually call it called to your point like I'm just imagining like if this game was it was a 3D game and there was like literally like a little force a little 3D icon for a Ford forest and you said like you know there's a little village and you're like your dude just runs out and goes and collects things in the forest and runs back that would have been the same sort of progress bar as like putting the car just this thing card on top of another card and watching that progress bar Advance as well I mean this is like the same concept right I mean I guess it's interesting in that it's different from that Norm because there was a lot there was a lot more uh the other unique thing about the card stuff is there was a lot more uh location management because you could move the cards around on this large board and eventually you do start running out of space and you're kind of like pushing the cards around uh to make sure you have space and all of that um which was novel but I don't think it was very rewarding like it felt like a it was interesting at first and then you would get it all perfectly set up and then some card would like pop out on top of it and it would mess up all of the perfect organization and then like it was fun to do it the first time and the second time it was less fun and the third time and I think that like that I agree that it was it was like frustrating when you would like open up a booster pack and like a chicken would jump out in a very traditional chicken fashion it's just like running around your little playmat like un uncontrolled or un unhoused I guess and a I thought that like I I thought it was like kind of funny a little bit that like the little chicken card was just like jumping around and like pooping out eggs every so often I'm like no like that fits the personality of a chicken I feel like uh in card form uh and it I think that like that helps to incentivize like oh I need to figure out a way to like pen in these animals that I have that are just running amok all over my little card Village here because otherwise yeah like they're gonna mess up the placement of my wood pile and then like the stick pile that I have right next to it and like all of my neat little organization of stuff um but also like throughout the course of the game you will be invaded by a little strange portal cards that a little red card will pop up on your play mat and then it'll say uh oh this doesn't seem good uh and the progress bar will like tick down and at the end of that monsters will pop out of it and they will like like hop around your your little village in a similar chicken fashion to like hunt down your villagers and yeah like I I agree that like oh my God you know it's it's annoying that like my Village is getting pushed around and stuff but I think that I like that it does even that it is annoying because I think that it fits like it adds it adds something to like tension about like no my like my Legos are all getting blown up by this you know this uh this monster Force here but what's also funny is like I wound up uh like a like I'm also I think I'm also like kind of bad at this game I think I'm getting better but I I think it may have like lost all of my villagers like five or six times so for me it's felt very roguey in that sense um but like Monsters you know you're fighting off like a wave of monsters they spawn into your into your base and I got creative by creating I had like this enormous uh stack of carrots like I don't know yes like 30 or 40 like carrots long just this huge stack and I just like started creating like walls of carrots to like keep the monster force from like getting close to my villagers because I was waiting for some kind of like sword or like item to finish crafting on the other side of the table wait like not can they not push their way through the big stack of carrots they can but it it slows them down some oh it's fascinating and so like I don't think this was that's a good emergent Behavior yeah like I don't think this was this was the intended behavior of the yeah but like it I was like okay like this is this is like a fun little thing that's fallen out of like this this wacky setup that we have here uh so with my big wall of carrots I was finally able to like get the the magic sword crafted that I was able to put on my villagers and then I okay now I have like a good fighting force to fend off these goblins but it was it was like a real like clock ticking down moment where I'm like you know I've I've been like beaten up by these goblins like twice now it's not gonna happen again I'm gonna make do everything I can to get in their way to do this there's like there's other ways that you can cheese it too but I thought that that was at least a little funny that way yeah I lost my first Village and then there was like one point early on that I almost lost my second village but then after a while I got to the point where I I'm not losing I can I could choose to enter the the boss the last boss fight before I'm ready but I don't think that there's anything that's coming out of the the portals that could hurt me and they get better over time but I'm getting proportionally more better than those are and I I didn't I didn't beat the end boss just because I was like I see where this is going it's just going to take me like four to five minutes more of like yeah I need to make sure I have all the right equipment and like gross more people and blah blah blah and I cheated and looked at what the ending was to figure out what was going on um and it's just like yeah the combat's not engaging enough for me to feel like I like I had already optimized a lot of my village already like that was the fun part is like I I I I did enjoy this game I enjoyed the the figuring out how to minimize that Randomness and then the movement like you say like oh I love watching chickens it's like I killed every animal that popped out of my pack immediately because they moved my cards around and that like ruined my perfection and I built a farming system on the one side and I had a stack of apples through the roof because like that was a contained way of growing stuff and in the early earlier game before you could uh set up pastors and stuff to do animal farming uh wow you played very very different you would have hated I think I showed you this at one point I took a screenshot but you would have hated my gameplay because you're talking about the chickens bouncing all over the place well tell you what also the chickens do they give you exponential growth because the more chickens they have the more eggs they have you put the more eggs under more chickens you get more chickens and so I had about a half of my game board like 28 chickens running around it's just scattering everywhere like we're using the wrong booster packs and you never got the like thing to let you smell tired well yeah because I thought the Armory was the thing that might have like eventually get like for some reason I put like Armory smeltery like all that stuff like under one like sort of like like I had no idea which pack to get like this melting stuff from so I exhausted all of the Armory first so I never had any challenges with like combat I'm just like yeah all my dudes have all this armor and weapons you want to [ __ ] with me all right but you couldn't make any of it like every time every time you beat someone or every time and something comes out and you kill it or you know you get something and also like out of the packs you get something so everyone was just like fully equipped right but you weren't getting it through you could have not opened a single one of those weapon packs and you've gotten all the weapons from fighting off goblins and whatnot well yeah that's that's probably true but I got both you know because I got the pack and so it was just like uh I had like a stacks of all my weapons and gear and so as I learned the the best strategy and this is one of my kind of like annoyances about this game is that the best strategy is the ones the most annoying because it takes the most clicks is to have all your guys have be naked and then once you see the threat because because the gameplay is essentially rock paper scissors you've got archery you've got melee and you've got uh Wizardry and they're all rock paper scissors with each other so if you have something that's a melee come out you're like oh great well I'm just gonna get archers and so you take your most powerful archery stuff you put it on your dudes that are available and then you attack it and that's like 30 clicks and it's just like oh my God I'm always pausing the game making all these clicks unpausing and it's just like yeah that's optimal but it wasn't fun and I couldn't stand not being optimal you know yeah this game is not really an Optimizer game did you pause it oh yeah I paused it but I was pausing every half second it felt like uh every notification everything that happened I'd be like what's going on I need oh I'll I'll lay it out for you I didn't really realize it was a rock paper scissors thing until you told me I had played it for like 10 hours I was like I don't know I just throw more guys at them a perfectly valid strategy like I just kind of like yeah I just hang out let my Village grow slowly uh build my little like or engine down in the corner and my my Apple engine up in the other corner and uh grow up for a while and like I like watching the progress bars go up I have played like a cookie clicker type game where it's literally the whole game is just watch bar go up get different thing that makes bar go up faster and get satisfaction from from Bargo up I mean that's factorio in a sense but it's just like this is a very this is a little less industrial than much less yes yeah but it does have that element of the thing pops out and it can pop out if you put things in the right place into the next thing and that's like the most industrialized you can get I mean I had it basically so I only had to do every once in a while I would go and grab like the the weird like Flint that comes out of the Rock Mine instead of rock sometimes and that like started cluttering it up if I didn't like take care of it but eventually I had to just like the cards would pop from the next thing to the next thing to the next thing um but I I so I'm gonna say I don't think that this is a roguelike game like I think that even if you like so even if it was more difficult and we were doing multiple runs of it the runs are the same yeah there's no there's no randomization of the board there's the randomization of what you get in the card packs but you they're cheap enough you can run through it again and you're expected to get everything from them pretty quickly yeah I don't I don't really disagree with that specifically and I was trying to like and I think that like where I was coming down with like oh it feels it feels roguelikey to me were was like the gameplay Loop of a the fact that I was bad and I was dying a whole bunch at the start but B that you have like a decent level of like meta progression so in this game you have like there's like a little um pop-up menu on off to the side and you have two tabs on it with quests and ideas and ideas are basically like oh here's like you've unlocked the recipe to craft this uh this house or like here's how to make cooked meat or coin chest or something like here's here's how you you build out this thing and I feel like that that's like the most rogy element of this game to some degree of like okay like here's my meta progression now I know how to make the sword so next time like if I do [ __ ] up and die then like oh like I know exactly I had a shortcut to like go and get that sword and like go and beat the goblins and like be be better the next time around um I think after like the third or fourth run that I've started I'm still on the same run now and I'm I'm like Crossing that threshold of like okay yeah I'm snowballing and I I really can't be stopped at this point um where yeah like to your point like it kind of stops being a roguelike game at that in that sense um and yeah like every every run will be the same where you're like okay I've got to go from farming to like building a stable portal so I can go and like grind Through The Dark Forest and get rewards from that magic dust and bubble and all that um well let me let me pose a question to you is Age of Empires a roguelike game no why not you are gaining you're doing runs of the game it's a randomized map you're Gathering resources and you're going towards some sort of end game is HIV and I is Age of Empires have a randomized map uh Age of Empires 2 the multiplayer is like semi-randomized Maps yeah they're like

or any of the civilization games that have caused under that same sort of Paradigm right sure uh I'll I'll not answer your question and fire back at you with a different question farewell how does how does this game compare to Agricola Colin you've played a gricola before right yeah that board game yeah yeah it's very for so will have you probably haven't played a group uh it is it is a very uh crunchy multiplayer board game but I guess it can be played solitary right uh yeah I don't think it's as good yeah but I mean I'm sure that there's single player rules for it right yeah but it's similar right in the sense that like you have it's it's very card driven uh maybe not run based necessarily but you know you have like villagers trying to keep your villagers alive and I forget what like I forget the scoring mechanism in Agricola specifically but I guess it's more about like like resource based than fighting monsters and killing goblins and stuff yeah I feel like so I I too have thought about like what is it that like this didn't feel like a roguelike game to me and I I did have a little bit of like why doesn't it feel like that to me and I think it's because assuming it was harder like if I if I had a harder time with it I did 10 runs before I felt like I beat it I don't think that those 10 runs would feel substantially different from each other right like you'd end up with like my goal would be to have the exact same build each time or to optimize towards a build so we'll we'll talk about factorio before and I think that's like factorio you can like literally copy blue blueprints from an old base and every like you might be iterating on like what the best way to build this Factory is but that's iterations of like your own internal design not of the game world uh you're not being given different opportunities you're being given different resources like if you take something like stacklands could be a roguelike game if it was like and in this game you just won't have berries yeah like where you have like the non-berry island or this game you're gonna have only rabbits and no chickens and so your your experience would be different you'd have to like build out a different economy because you lack certain resources or something like that so different synergistic archetypes is like what I'm looking for in a roguelike and it doesn't have that it's not a roguelike in my opinion well I mean like to split hairs like if we if we wanted a data-driven approach my my data set says that this game is like only six percent of the steam tags come out to something that that are roguelike in nature which I feel like that that that sounds about right where like more more things that you would associate better standards of the genre like your your Hades your binding of Isaacs or Cog mines you know very very kind of different game flows like those are more kind of like in the 15 to 20 and that that kind of feels that feels right for those kinds of games this being like six percent on that very you know it's it's so this game is a card battle a card battler management Survival game with like just like a dash like a little right yeah so like it's I I would say for me if you had to be like is this game a roguelike game yes or no I would say no but it's definitely more of a roguelike game than Super Mario yeah uh or even Agricola Skyrim yeah like Agricola clearly not a roguelike but like uh I feel like if yeah if you if you had a gun gun to my head and said like between like a digitized version of Agricola versus stacklands which one's the roguelike like I guess I would have to say sacklands but yeah again like I don't I also don't know that it really matters at this point because like for for what it's worth like games that there's like it's a big Spectrum right it's like with with shooter games you know which which shooter game is like the closest to Doom do you guys remember like the whole like fervent craze with like games being called Doom likes back in the in the 90s vaguely but I I feel like I've read more about it than yeah than experienced it but yeah we're like oh this game is this game is not a doom like it's a it's a shooter game it's like okay that's fine or when like when we were in high schools like it's the Halo killer yeah this is the new Halo mm-hmm that was definitely a thing for a while like is this the first person shooter game yeah how does so stack lands uh I think like the the quest system in this game is very interesting to me because it doesn't so in one of your like your little sidebar menu thing you open up the the quest Tab and there's lots of question marks there to start I think this is another kind of element of like the Rogue nature to it of like exploring what those things are and like oh what like what the hell you know you have some like hints sprinkled throughout of like explore the Dark Forest like there's a dark force in this game like build a stable portal like there's portals like where am I portaling to there's like a sense of I think mystery to it that as you are building out your your village and finding those cards and fighting monsters to get those cards yeah it's basically going to be the same experience every time but I feel like that first time that you go through you're going through those quests and like unlocking those things of like grow a berry bush like well like how the hell do I do that you know um that kind of process of unlocking those things that that meta progression uh step does feel pretty rogy to me so for me it wasn't a meta progression though it was just a regular progression right I unlocked almost everything in my first playthrough and I died because I was like huh I wonder what happens if you if you put this golden chalice in the temple it's like and I like some some pop-up appears I'm like yeah sure whatever like the devil appears or whatever you're just like absolutely murders everyone like not even close yeah uh but and like I built that way before I should have like I hadn't unlocked a lot of stuff but uh I I enjoyed that progression uh but I didn't get that sense of truly like a meta progression I got it as a sense of like here's some some quest lines that are halfway between quests and hints on how you should be playing the game up to up to the end game of of it where you kind of understand how the how how new things are are generated new ideas So eventually you can just like buy new ideas and they'll just like pop out recipes yeah uh when you're just like swimming in money I do like the uh I do like the concept where like if you have like a gold chest you can just drag it onto like your little University Building yeah and then like oh it'll generate an idea for you like I like there's a lot of little ideas like that in this game that just like you said in a very like Zen like chill it's it's a chillax game it's a very chillax card management game where things like that like you know hey University I'm going to pay you some money give me an idea that I haven't discovered yet or like you know and the ideas are the things that um that are yeah like your little uh crafting recipes like oh I haven't discovered this crafting recipe before that looks interesting oh I have all the resources to build it I'll try that and oh like it's unlocked this kind of aspect of the tech tree for me like those are like the little charm elements that I'm like you know it feels like a nice little warm blanket and like a mug of cocoa to me Scott have you played uh or heard of dwarf romantic uh I have heard of it and this is a G-rated uh this is absolutely the most G-rated game it's like Bill's beautiful uh landscape yeah with like little little houses and and cute little cartoony trees and and you have like little hexes right yeah Settlers of Catan kind of things yeah I I'm looking at now I did not play for very long I play for 45 minutes so I didn't it didn't catch my like the gameplay didn't like catch me immediately uh and I just had kind of haven't gone back to it but I really like the aesthetic of it and I'm just thinking about I think that this would have been a better game if they didn't go with a card theme if they'd just be like what if we just make like a pretty little game with hexes and and little building tiles and all right but then it looked like all the other ones like honestly this is only a differentiator is the fact that it is a card game or quote-unquote card game and so I think they did it right because otherwise this just falls into that General boring genre what I consider like another one of those City making games that is just like all the others I want there to be good City making games I know don't we all don't we all yes I'm chasing that dream too man or like one one thing that I was like debating on putting on the uh the candidacy list for for this podcast is um have you let's oh God what is it the um oh it's killing me that I can't remember the name of it the the the Beaver game the beaver Colony management Sim game oh right I know I've done that one uh uh Timberlands or Timber yeah Timber born Timber born

deeply Early Access uh-huh I'm like very into it uh I basically was like yes I want this to be Dwarf Fortress but with beavers instead of worse like little beavers of industry and it wasn't quite that when I played it I've I've kind of kept tabs on it it's getting closer yeah you're getting there they're adding more stuff and it's you're you're able to build more stuff now but it's kind of like what I want I wish Dwarf Fortress looks like in terms of like how you deal with 3D things but I guess I'll maybe also name drop uh what we're thinking about city city or like Village management like games but on the total opposite end of the spectrum still pretty chill uh though uh uh Frost punk I would imagine might be something in that same that same vein not nearly as uh as stress-free as as stack lands but um I think part of so the the sock pop collective uh I'm just like scrolling through their their uh filmography here uh they've got like a hundred games yeah like as far as I can tell I think they their goal is as a as a group of game devs is to a make 100 games and then I I want to say I was reading something about how like they start with like okay we're gonna build 100 game prototypes and like the ones that are interesting or fun for us will like continue supporting and like make them more more feature Rich I feel like so stacklands is like maybe the most recent one and they've released one two three four five six like seven games since then but stack lands like may have been a victim of its own success where a it's super cheap this is like a five dollar game but B like um it's like more more than like three times as popular as the next game that they that they have developed yeah so that it's like okay so this studio just does a lot of like game Jam things like I could see this this feels like a very very fleshed out game Jam game yeah where it's like what if Village building game but cards and they just ran with it for a while and took it to its like most full conclusion and

since it's cards it's like I imagine a pretty simple game to like get a prototype up and like work your way through to an end game type thing and there you have it you've got your your card game you don't have to worry about Graphics you don't have to worry about like 3D animation really here the card is just bouncing around but yeah mostly static image I think this game more well like so I'll show for for the sock pop collective a little bit here because they have a I think it's like a three dollar patreon where like you you subbed to their patreon for three bucks and then you get access to like their whole hundred game catalog um I would be more inclined to do that if like and again I don't know how uh how deep any of these games are or if like any of them are as as polished or as interesting to me as stacklands but I think for like three bucks it's probably like easy enough to just like drop that and be like this one looks interesting maybe I'll try this um if I didn't have like 10 000 other games to be playing simultaneously but uh the I think stack lands might might like have escaped their orbit a little bit and like in a good way like yeah maybe like more more successful than they had anticipated and I think that like what stacklands maybe needs most is mod support yeah that actually I I could imagine it being a good platform for a similar genre of game I mean you could put so many more cards in there yeah like there's just having them do make different things out of a card like a bar go up for a different thing is pretty easy for like me to design like if they gave me all the tools I like I could think about it from like a gameplay perspective uh and I'm sure will could add like 10 10 stats on you know this this beats this or this does like damage over time or it's rock paper scissors but there's five different things and so it's like a you get some do some weird Synergy things where you get legendary armor sets or something where you're not just waiting for the the two sides to gradually Whittle down and to be only one you know I'll defend the combat system a little bit because I was uh I sent a like a horde of ninjas through the portal to the Dark Forest and like I was I was like ready for Revenge time because I'm like you know these guys have just been ragdolling me the whole time I finally figured out how to make make ninjas and like iron shields for them and everything so I had like this entire stack of like Decked Out ninjas to like go in and they were just like ninja starring everything left and right it felt very satisfying uh but like did either of you notice the like the um like the very effective like arrows pointing absolutely right away I figured as much not really into my own but when I saw that it happened I just was like uh whatever and I never bothered to like keep track of what was happening and then you could hit a magic person and the magic person messed you up because those are all classified as archers

archers you know just just an even mix

just so you all know like it isn't actually just watching two besides Whittle down you you see their side and you know they can attack it straight across when they have even amounts or they can attack like adjacent if they are uneven and so you have to just calibrate it such that all of your dudes that are tend to be better against melee or whatever tend to be fighting the thing that they're against and so you can move your guys around during the battle and so that's like that's the how you optimize gameplay but you know that isn't very satisfying for me I mean I've I got a little bit of of satisfaction of like moving the characters around a little bit so that like a that you know I was matching the sort of distribution of like oh they have like all their like really uh hard-hitting guys on this one side I'll put all of my hard-hitting guys on that side to match them making sure that like to like minimize those very effective arrows like back and forth I felt like there was there was just enough uh cognitive load from the combat that it didn't like it felt right for the game games kind of pace and theme and like it wasn't too much it wasn't too little it's just just the right amount for what what it was going for but yeah like I could see like mod support for this like the stacklands feels very much like a a great uh card platform yeah for other stuff and like the base game of stacklands is great I like it a lot um but like when so you know I think like Colin you've played a lot more tabletop simulator than I have yeah but like how like to me tabletop simulator is like somewhat frustrating with like how the cards move around it doesn't feel very tactile it's very finicky yeah whereas like this like functionally like visually looks exactly like tabletop Simulator the physics of the cards bouncing around was very smooth like it it never did things that I didn't expect I sometimes they did things that I found annoying like this card moved and bumped this card and bumped this card and I was like ah but it was always like I could see a very clear chain of like why they all moved like the physics of the cards moving around and all that stuff uh they're very smooth to like grab stuff I I think that you could build you could build a different game or not even a different game you could build a that you could turn this game into a a more true Rogue like where you did have different paths you could go down so there's a whole second half of this game that we haven't talked about at all where you send your dudes to an island and you basically start the game over again with slightly different resources and you eventually get the ability to take your villagers back and forth I did a little bit of that and I was like this is just the same game again with yeah very slightly different things um but you could you could have a a path like that where you you know you're you're picking up your stuff every once in a while you're moving on to something else uh and you're you're sending out something to get resources and and trading back and forth for something along those lines yeah I don't think it would be yeah you could make a mod for it pretty easily with just changing values of the of the the systems that they already have in place

I suppose I don't know I've got 9.2 hours into this game I lost I I think I I thought I was uh gonna beat the the dark uh forest or whatever I thought I was fighting the witch Nest but I or next but I like miscalculated like that I was actually on uh turn nine instead of ten and so I sent the wrong mix of dudes they all got wiped I'm just like I can't be bothered to watch all those progress bars to regenerate and that was the end for me so I don't know did you like Scott did you finish the game I got 9.2 hours into it and that was pretty much I'm good I don't want any mods I'm just I'm done with it for me but yeah I think um I've only put maybe like five or six hours into it so far but like like Colin said like for me it's been very much a like wind down for the day kind of game like you know after dinner Evening News is on like I'll put you know like half-assedly like play some stack lands and watch little progress bars go by and like oh there's a portal I gotta go beat up the portal guys but and then like I get like super super excited into it um but no I haven't I haven't gotten to the point of uh so I built a temple I haven't gotten the Goblet for the temple to get like one of the main main bosses yet but I'm on I think the like the last stage of the dark forests and I think I'm like I'm like still trying to figure out the um like the Villager management like HP sequence of like you know you send your villagers into the thing they get like brutalized down to like five hit points out of 20 or something like okay like I'll swap the gear out to my fresh guys and let the other ones kind of like regen for a few turns uh and then send those guys back into the portal for the next next uh next wave I think that's where I'm at right now and I'm still like relatively engaged by the process but yeah I think like what Colin's saying about how you know you you basically kind of like do this same sort of theme I I I do want to like point out that like at some point you you get like what are they like destination cards or something there's like a mountain there's a graveyard like seven or so yeah yeah there's like these different like biome cards I guess that you you put a villager on to like explore and like they will like shoot out like oh they they found a rock or they found like some armor or they found a gold or you know they encountered a skeleton like I I kind of like that mechanic like I thought that was that was pretty fun or at least like the first you know few times that I've seen it so far um yeah I don't I don't know that I have like enough motivation to like see this game to the end of like the island stage specifically I do see a lot of like pictures of people's uh bases from like the stackland subredditor on their Discord of like you know they they have like um there's a lot more kind of like almost factorial level management things where you can get the cranes and the glue and yeah and stuff and I don't know if I really really want to go that deep I might go as far as like beating like the Demon Lord of like the main the main village kind of scenario and I think that might be as far as I take it but I'm I'm intrigued to get that far and yeah I think like so far for me it's been a relatively chill process to do so I played it for like four hours in a row one day so it can't be that bad like I it engaged me enough that I was like I I did like watching those progress bars go up and I did like the feeling of like I like engine building and I think that it had a it's a simple engine builder but it did it was a pretty s move it was a little slower than I would have liked but it was a pretty smooth engine build up for the for the the beginning part especially once once you get into like the mid game I felt like I had a good time like trying to figure out how to build a factorio factory in a system that's not meant to be that and I think that's but it like in a good way yeah like it was a Zen build up your your little base and eventually you get to to fight something at the end it's like a factorio game for for like and I mean this in a good way like like middle schoolers or little kids where it's like you know low violent but like creative and like fun and cute enough that like you know you're not building flamethrowers to like Massacre like billions of bugs and I'm already engineering things at work I don't like to come home always I don't always like to come home and play a thing that's actually harder Engineering in Victoria than what I'm doing for money sometimes it's nice to come back and just be like hey it's like my day job but easy and just peaceful and I don't have to worry about messing stuff up I just you know can build my little farm build my stacks of apples feed all my little villagers and uh go fight some some goblins also just as a recommendation like and I want to plug this too because I've got 95 I think hours into this game and I thought it was like similar to what you guys are talking about this game about it I was like wait a minute stacklands Pro over here uh medieval Dynasty if you want like a chill game where it is like minor sort of connecting things and like little like you know factorialization of things and uh it's it's the 3D sort of like version of a village Builder I thought that game was uh really chill and fun so you might check it out I don't know Colin I think you didn't actually play it or did you I yeah I have not played it okay it's on my list of like it's not rated very high but I I should I should play when I get around to it should we go ahead and rate uh this game yeah let's let's move on to rankings uh I'll start first I I really liked stack lands or at least what I've been uh played of it so far uh I think for me this is my new number three game uh just edging out invisible ink and just behind Binding of Isaac it has that like like it's it's definitely hooked me more than invisible ink does I think like production value wise as invisible ink is a much better and like much uh like fully featured game but like getting into that like Flow State of like oh I can't wait to see what like this thing does or like it's just it's like such an interesting and different experience in a in a venue that I've seen before but like just the way that it's kind of executed and its charm has has really kind of stuck with me so for me it's number three behind Binding of Isaac and ahead of invisible ink

I guess I'll go ahead and jump in I see that Colin is just now filling in his his score so um I gave it a 6.5 out of 10. um which with the games we played so far the uh we're up to 12. we got a dozen games under our hats yeah but with these uh 12 games that puts it at number four behind um number one's invisible and then I guess I have a tie for FTL and Binding of Isaac rebirth for number two um and two and three I guess so um yeah a decent uh decent game for for what we played I think it's worth it was worth it was worth about the nine hours I put into it like I had a it was engaging but now I'm I got uh I kind of got it pretty quick I think relative to um uh other games that have you know I like I like a 20-hour game I think should be a good Baseline I say that but then I think about the Stanley Parable and I think well that's not true so it's it's a fine game it's fine I laugh because after this whole this whole uh episode uh the actual ranking of games by my ranking is lower than Wills which is not what I would have thought but I think that's just because my average ranking of all the other games is is higher uh I I this is my my five out of 12 game uh right behind Den's curse which is the diabolo wow and right ahead of pineapple smash career which was another kind of like zenflo State game that you guys that I liked more than you guys but I I liked I'll still go to bat for pineapple smash crew I think I had a great two hour two three hours playing that game I deeply enjoyed them I don't know if it's like a great game but no I think like this is right above I I say this game Falls in solidly above my threshold of games that I liked like I would say yeah if someone said hey should I get this game I'd be like yeah you'll probably like it if you're looking at it and wondering if you'll like it yes probably you will uh I think it it minus the card theme it does what it says it is it's uh build a little village out of cards um

it did that and it was an enjoyable experience to do it yeah okay my threshold's six out of ten like if anything's a five or below five that just don't play but six point five that's in the okay I can recommend this uh and then the other two games I think were yeah seven point five sir or something or thereabouts oh and eight for invisible so it's pretty good well you can find all of those detailed statistics on our handy dandy website grogpod.zone uh you can you can follow us on Master now we gotta we got a new Mastodon follower by the way it's happening the snowball is happening you all laughed you doubted elon's kingdom is grumbling one follower at a time what what manner of Beast is it is it like uh a smaller Mastodon that's following us is it uh like what what's the the little like scrabbling creature from uh Ice Age we're gonna have a string of little uh uh saber-toothed tigers following us uh uncertain but uh but uh if you want to send an email into the show and have us have us read it out you can reach out to us at grogpodzone gmail.com uh we have to figure out what what our next episode here is and I don't know if Colin wants to to flip his his mega coin again or me rolling my dice I got my dice box out just in case but uh that coin is just it's it's two it looks like a Soviet War medal that just doesn't have a ribbon attached to it yeah all right so we got one side we got uh the front of an airplane on the back side we have uh a tournament a turbine engine so that's fun I guess so I think we what did we narrow it down well yeah so our randomizer shot out desktop dungeons black book and risk of rain one but I think we like in our deliberations we wound up like kept trying to Hype up I think we've like hyped up cognine like for two or three episodes now so we're like okay well we gotta at least give it a a shot and we'll put it into the roguelikey nature of the coin flip method but I think we'll we'll keep black book in the uh backlog for the moment uh and we're gonna have a coin flip off between risk of rain one or Cog mine do we want mind come on but you're crazy because like yeah we'll say risk of rain is airplane cockpit and Cog mine is turbine engine come on cockpit okay here comes the flip there it goes

thank God oh wait actually now I forget which one did I say you say cockpit cockpit was [ __ ] mined yeah oh I'm sorry wait a minute no no that's that's what is this oh no oh no will has to play one of the greatest roguelike games of all time now I played it it's a terrible game it's one of the worst games of all time risk of rain risk of rain it is how many hours do I have to put into this you have to put in 55 000 hours you only put you put five into the I don't know if I can do five I can put like maybe a couple well you could put however many hours you want and it could just be the the Scott and Collins show talking about yes uh fun a fun side scroller you can talk about um side scrollers you know like this might be an impetus for us to try to get uh will to like play it with like Colin do you think risk of rain one is good with local multiplayer or is it better solo oh I've ever played it with multiplayer uh I don't know if it's worth trying or if that would be a better experience we could try it out but yeah like I mean we do have the option of like local multiplayer also and like if an in-person multiplayer experience is better than online or whatever I think the online for risk of brain was supposed to be kind of janky which kind of wouldn't surprise me but my computer is very immobile I not sure I uh a local party well so I test I tested this at the board game con over the weekend where I brought my my steam deck and four Xbox controllers and it works believe it or not it does work uh and I think risk of brain was probably low low resource enough to like big screen it yeah play through Steam deck yeah now that you're saying this like can I know we've just decided but streets of Rogue is that one still gonna be backed off into these because that's a similar sort of thing that I haven't played and that might actually be good streets of Rogue is I yeah I think that game is also very good is it decided that sounds like you've got the tone of its desire I think we're decided we'll sign off we'll sign off with risk of rain and uh if uh if we come in next episode with a different game I would be shocked but I I want to play racer brain I liked it yeah I think risk of rain will you go find your own game and you can you can play or just uh we have like a special will segment where I just rant about the the Down The House side scrollers are the worst way of having fun ever that sounds great I love that yeah welcome to the slay the Spire Corner again right episode 2795. today we're going to be exploring the archetype of oh yeah that's a lot of fun is it or is it not a block card

indeed shiv all shiv deck oh Lord all claw no um all right yeah that's gonna do it for our stack lands episode slash half the time us talking about risk of rain one and orcog mine uh join us join us next time we will definitely be talking about risk of rain one much to Will's malignment he's gonna come around to it he's it's gonna be he's if he doesn't if we can convince will to not hate the game I think it'll count as the moral Victory but I'm gonna try to I'm gonna put myself in the shoes of some unfortunate soul like yourself and try and enjoy it and we'll see what happens yeah and we'll we'll try and dive into the depths of Wheels wanting to understand why he hates side twirlers all right yep until then see you next time [Music] foreign
