The.
Hello again, another listener.
It's been ages.
Perhaps you've forgotten how this podcast is played.
Allow me to remind you this is the Grog Pod broke Bike podcast wherein each episode we we noticed that the weather's changing and we got a dive into the woods to a nice cozy cabin to get away from from all this spooky fall weather and and come into this cabin to to chain ourselves to a desk and review some rogue like games and revisit them at the end of the year for the great transcendence.
1:09
I am your deranged game master and photography buff Scalberger, and with me are my Co hosts conspiring to steal my throne.
It's me, Colin, a man turned into a toad and stuffed into a card.
And this is Will.
1:27
I'm the most overpowered card in the game, obviously.
Hey, I'm a squirrel or something.
This is.
Andrew Harshman.
Hi, this is this is your, your guest, the lucky, lucky Carter, Woody Saskowski.
And I gotta, I gotta stop you right there because Scott brought up that you guys, which this is like a personality quiz.
1:45
I wanna bring up real quick which of the four well characters in inscription are you 'cause you I I see I have 4 cubes sitting on my Zoom screen here.
And I feel like I, I feel like.
I feel like Will is definitely the supercomputer vibes.
2:02
He's he's all about the optimal plays.
Are you calling him a square head?
I mean, you're 100% all.
Actually have pretty angular heads.
You heard of your first?
Yeah.
Yeah, this is the hot takes that that that Woody guess on for.
Andrew is definitely the scribe of death and or death metal.
2:20
I would say thank you, thank you.
So, Scott, you're stuck as the magic scribe, I guess.
Maybe.
Maybe you the the Christmas tree with the glowing eyeball.
Yeah, the weirdest, the weirdest character you are.
You are already half spoiled on the episode that we're talking about today, which is.
2:38
OK, well, I'm going to stop you again because just when I come in, I just interrupt you all the time.
That's part of the deal.
That's what people are here for.
You you you say like half spoiled but like isn't the name of the episode in the title?
That's.
True.
Anyone?
Does anyone like, close their eyes and it's just like I'm playing the new episode, what's it going to be?
2:54
We should we should start out with this though.
Like if you are listening to this podcast and you haven't everyone knows and you haven't played inscription go.
This is heavy spoilers and the game is better if you don't have spoilers.
Nobody listens to our podcast.
There's no.
Reason for this right?
3:10
So I'm.
Speaking to the void and therefore no one will need to heat this warning.
There you go.
Wait, I have to go.
I have to go play this game now.
I was just going to talk out of my ass for two hours.
Yeah, you got to you got to like and subscribe first before closing the podcast or actually just leave it running.
3:26
So that way we get all the engagement statistics and then you run away to to go and play it.
Yes, we're playing the haunted house, escape room, Rogue Lake this week inscription.
And as I quickly get through all these boring snap stuff before everyone starts jumping into their their thoughts.
3:42
Inscription released October 19th, 2021 coming up soon on the anniversary another find it anywhere kind of game.
PC, PlayStation, Xbox, which was developed and published by Gamefuna.
Oh, not have that given here Daniel Mullen's games, which he has, or that studios put out Pony Island and recently Pony Island 2.
4:08
Pony Island 2 does not exist yet.
Well, it's it's, it's coming soon, I guess.
Yeah, that this is, I mean soon I think I I got all hyped on inscription and I went to the website and they were talking about Pony Island 2 and then at the end it was flashing 20252026.
Oh my God, it may.
4:23
Be a ways in the future.
What is Pony Island?
Oh, it's not what I thought it would be.
This is terrifying.
Have you played Pony Island?
Colin, I haven't.
Oh, it's it's it's worth your time.
It's has a lot of the same neat things that Inscription does, but it's a lot shorter.
4:40
But Daniel Mullins has put out, I think like a dozen other smaller games throughout the ages.
Description is published by our good friend devolver digital.
Responsible for enter the gungeon previous episode cult of the lamb previous episode, loop hero previous episode down well possible episode and some some other ones that.
4:59
Are of all of the hype that y'all were generating before we played this hype in the form of like mystery like, oh, don't don't spoil yourself Andrew go in totally blind and.
Oh, prepared to have your?
Mind shattered and blown at the same time of of all of that hype, the thing that got me equally as hyped was seeing the Devolver splash screen.
5:20
I'm like, oh, they should have told me it was Devolver.
That was the big thing that we were prepping you for.
But by the way, it's a Devolver game inscription rolls in at lucky number 13.
Thirteenth most popular roguelike game on steam 118,936 total reviews.
5:39
Your average player of inscription has about 20 hours in it according to the data that I've pulled.
So now now, OK, this is this is the cut off point for spoiler territory.
You've been like pre spoiled enough.
This is it.
We're we're, we're opening up the gate to the cabin.
5:58
It is spoiler time now, so hit that pause button if if you're just like blindly listening.
Or I want I want to add a quick little disclaimer here if you if you find that your taste in video games is similar to mine, then maybe just disregard this morning and go ahead and enjoy the episode.
6:15
Spoiler spoiler alert for my review.
But yeah, otherwise, yeah, if if you if you want to all.
Right.
So that that gives us the the open, open platform here for Woody to give us the one sentence description of inscription before I take his picture and add it to my deck.
6:36
Oh, perfect.
All right.
Postmodern medley of trading card game creepypasta roguelike.
Yeah, I think the least accurate part of that is roguelike.
6:51
Yes, I agree.
But we're on a roguelike podcast.
I mean, Scott asked me if I wanted to be on this episode.
I'm like, yeah, I like inscription, but I don't think that's a roguelike.
Game.
The first bullet point that I have here in the Google doc is honorary rogue, in that this game, this game I don't think is is a roguelike end to end, but I think the first third of this game, it solidly qualifies.
7:17
Depends on how good you are at card games is how much it's a like a roguelike.
And also to be clear, there is like a dedicated mode that we'll get into in a little bit that is just like a pure roguelike deck builder.
Yes.
So that is true.
I'm willing to round up the fact that this is like point or like, I don't know what like .6 of a roguelike up to like one point O.
7:40
It's a It's a man with a bushy costume and a glowing eye.
That's going to Halloween is a rogue like the.
Thing that's odd about this game is even though I don't believe overall that the game really is a rogue like is a rogue like unless unless it presents itself that way.
7:59
Like you're essentially losing out on what I think is like the biggest moment of surprise in the game.
Because when I, I, I first got introduced to this game because I think it won like game of the year on, on Polygon in 2022 or 2023, whenever it came out.
8:18
And I only saw the screenshots of the first part of the game.
Because that's kind of the part that I don't know, you're probably going to spend the most time with as you're figuring things out.
And the I think that the big shock, like if you're someone who has played a lot of games that fit in the roguelike genre and you're like, oh, this is roguelike and you're kind of just it's like the structure is something like slave aspire.
8:44
And you're like, OK, like I know how these kind of games work.
And then sort of the giant reveal is like, that is not the end of the game.
That is not even like close to the end of the game when you win that.
But that reveal only works if you're already interested in roguelikes and that's what you think this game is.
9:04
You, you, you know what I'm saying?
Like that has no, if you're someone who's never played a game before and you're like, oh, I'm interested in this description game.
I like card games and you try it, but you're not familiar with the structure of roguelikes.
That shock of defeating Leshi in the first act and then realizing that there's way more like game to play is not a surprise.
9:28
It's just like, Oh yeah, I guess this is what the game is.
There's no rug pole moment if you don't have any rugs in your house.
Yeah, that's a good.
That's a good way to put it.
It's like this game is so much based on like toying with your expectations, but like, those only work if you already have a lot of preconceived expectations of how things work.
9:49
Like this game is so designed for me, like in terms of like, because I've been a Magic the Gathering player, like, you know, my whole almost my whole life since elementary school.
And like I've always had a thing for card games really like, you know, roguelikes.
10:09
And it's just, it's just such a weird amalgam of ideas going on here.
And I just, I don't know, I have a real soft spot for games that like are about like the meta process of making games.
10:26
I mean, I think that's essentially what a lot of this game is about is like Daniel Mullins has like laid out.
He's like, hey, here's a game I made in the first act.
And like the rest of the game is like, here's other games I could have made that are like kind of the same but have different mechanics.
10:42
It's.
Like it's like jazz.
It's really the first act is, you know, him playing like this is this is the structure.
And then the 2nd and the 3rd are like, you know, just basically Griffin with it and really just doing, doing whatever over the top, over the top of the, the structure.
10:59
And yeah, no, you're, you're absolutely right, though, because he does in many, in many places.
It's not just like by act, it's like by some, some characters themselves like, are like, Hey, I remember distinctly in act three, that one robot.
That's like, all right, we're going to like have new rules introduced every time.
11:16
And they're going to be like, you choose like the conditions.
And so it's like, Oh, well, that's a interesting way of presenting like a new rule structure to the same sort of game.
And that's what happens like over and over with all the different, you know, act two, act three sort of shenanigans.
11:33
The quantity, like this game isn't a tremendously long game.
Scott said.
That like people had 20 hours, which seems like a lot to me because I think you could probably beat this game in under 10.
But like, the quantity of ideas that exist in this game is like crazy.
11:51
Like there's so many single ideas that could be flushed out into like more fully formed games.
Like the third act where you fight these four different bosses.
Like essentially every boss has its own like idea mechanic that you could build a game out of.
12:08
And it's just like, oh, this is just a little throwaway thing.
And like, in some ways I feel like it's kind of to the games detriment because it's like there's so many mechanics that a lot of them don't really work great.
But it's just, it's a really cool game if you're interested in like the way games are designed.
12:30
Well, it may not be a very long game, but for me it felt like a very long game.
I can tell you that it's Yep, you're, you're absolutely right.
There are a lot of ideas in in this game and I'd be very curious to sit down at a convention for a little post mortem on the development of this.
12:52
Surely such a thing exists at like.
My second bullet point in my Google Doc here is we gave Andrew an impossible assignment this episode because Andrew was Andrew was operating on a shortened week here and we just happened to drop a game that we all have beaten already into his lap and say go ahead and play it, but make sure not to look up anything about this game in the process.
13:16
We also did the thing that's my least favorite, which is like when someone tells you something's really good and then like while you're watching or playing it, they're like, isn't this so good?
Aren't you enjoying my thing?
Y'all are being too hard on yourselves.
No, no, I like this is this is unrelated to you.
13:34
This is just a general pet peeve of mine.
If you're like doing something, if you're watching a movie and you like it or like someone's watching and like and they like it and they're like, oh, this is, I love this scene.
She's like, well, I probably would have too, but now I'm just thinking about what?
Now I just have to rate it.
13:49
It's like, that's one of like the the very mixed blessing of like having a new partner or something.
And you're like, look, I get to like, we get to show each other all these movies that we really like.
And then you sit down and you can see like their face burning and you're like, uh oh, they are not enjoying this.
14:05
I have to like, it's just like I, yeah, you have to be OK with.
However people respond I.
Don't know, and sitting a new romantic partner down and having them forcing them to play inscription is is a great like test of of the mettle of relationship.
14:22
Like here you go.
No, I, I kid, of course.
And the the other task that was set before me was like, Hey, you need to make sure you should, you should, you should make a concerted effort to beat the game to actually finish it.
I would say that you, the main, like you, make the concerted effort to at the very least get through act one.
14:41
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure, I am surprised going through it the second time how much I forgot about the other two acts and was all of my memories were just act one.
Well, yeah, let's this is like a weird game.
I mean, it's a weird game structurally.
14:57
And like because of that, I feel like maybe we should talk about like an overview and then sort of I feel like like it's a rogue like podcast.
We want to talk more about the mechanics in act one, but also the whole thing.
Yeah, I think the whole thing in general because like.
15:15
The game, the game is like it's not even 4th wall breaking.
It's like 5th wall breaking in a way.
So like, yeah, I think the you know, we we always have like the the bid on the program of like our story begins with blah, blah, blah.
But in this case, your story continues.
15:31
You don't start a new game in inscription, you continue from some previous save that has existed in this thing.
And it's already like a little weird to start because there's some voice over like OK, let's see what's in this.
You're like, OK, was that like some narrator or something?
15:49
But you are dropped into act one out of like, let's say 3 of this game, yeah.
There there's there's essentially an extended credit sequence, which I think is just more of like, hey, here's more ideas that could have been part of the game, but.
It's like an.
16:05
Epilogue almost yeah exactly aren't really like playable I.
Do like the battle disc at the end like Yu-gi-oh style?
Yeah, which is it's pretty cool and I love the way it.
It's like very PS1 and like it just starts totally glitching and falling apart.
16:23
But anyway, act one you are dropped into a a horror themed deck builder where your your goal is to defeat the opponent across from you, which is just a mysterious glowing pair of eyes.
16:44
And the way that you do this is by, well, doing the thing that you always do in these deck builder games.
You go through an FTL style node traversal map.
You have events that do certain things and you're trying to figure out combinations of like, well, what card is good?
17:02
Or a trying to figure out the symbology first and then using that knowledge of symbology over time to figure out like, OK, yeah, this is this is how I play.
And then but once you get that system, then you're like me and you're like, ha, I've figured it out.
17:18
I'm a smart rogue like deck building player.
This boss is going to be no, oh, that's a big wall of flying grizzly bears that I now can't defeat.
And the game is just toying with me.
And why did everyone say that this game was so great?
17:35
Thought I understood the systems.
I thought I was beating it and then like impossible.
No Kobayashi Maru no win scenario mode shows up.
Well, and that's even though the first act of this game that you're describing is the most roguelike game.
17:51
I do I don't know if one of the characteristics of a roguelike is like, do you guys feel like you have to be able to beat the game like on the 1st playthrough?
Because I it I think it may be possible to beat this game in the very first playthrough through like weird sort of glitch your cheating methods, but like if this game very much wants you to lose at least one or two times to be able to advance the narrative of the game.
18:22
Well, that's what that grizzly wall is like.
If you haven't died that you don't get it if you die more times.
But it's like, well, here's a I don't know if it's actually impossible to beat.
You can, you can beat it.
It is theoretically possible.
18:39
There are videos of people doing it as kind of like a sicko mode challenge.
But like, yeah, it's it the the game is telling you that no, like you are, you're supposed to go through like a failure cycle, I think at least twice.
I think it's it's starting like four or five times, I think.
18:56
Is it?
Yeah, because, well, it's they they have mechanics in there to support you losing that many times so that they can like basically give you, hey, here's the OP card that you designed.
And basically they just make it so that the they're like boosting you to a win really strongly by, you know, beyond like the fifth run or so.
19:14
But like, yeah, yeah, like 1-2 you're supposed to die.
Three, maybe you get, maybe you get close.
Four, you probably should be getting close, you know, almost there.
And by the 5th, if you're not getting it, that's that's problematic.
But yeah, it's, it's very much like the, the mechanics are kind of designed to push and funnel you to try.
19:32
It becomes almost inevitable that you will win eventually, like just through the mechanics and the bonuses that the game gives you.
Because, and I, I mean, I think that's smart because like this gives a game where the main appeal is the narrative.
19:48
Like to elaborate on what Scott was talking about a little bit like the basic game mechanic, 'cause I think you're in a 4A4 by three grid and you just have one of the four card slots you can place your sort of creatures in and then they just attack forward.
20:04
So it's kind of like Magic the Gathering, except the placement of your cards very much matters because they'll attack the enemy directly across from them.
It's like it's.
Like an auto battler in some sense, yeah.
Yeah, and the the sort of gimmick behind it is instead of using, you know, mana crystals like in Hearthstone or Magic, you sacrifice your creatures to pay for bigger creatures.
20:29
Like by sacrificing them they generate blood which then you can use for bigger creatures and you or if they.
Die you you use their bones to their.
Bones.
Yeah.
And you just always, there's two different decks you can pick from.
There's like the deck that you build with your creatures, and there's always a squirrel deck, which is essentially just a free creature you can sacrifice for something else.
20:50
It's like your resource pile.
It's it's actually kind of like a Lone Star, like Lone Star and then Cobalt Core.
I think that's what it was called.
But it's just like the idea of having like the position of two sides and like that being like the main mechanic is like there's multiple things, you know, 4 plus or whatever on each side and like the yeah, they're just attacking straight across or with some strange variance which each of these games is introduces.
21:11
But it's not like a brand new mechanic.
But it's just like it's, I think, well done and it's and it's in the way it did it.
Sure, sure.
Another interesting thing I think that should be pointed out about the the card playing format is that instead of having like a a set number of hit points, there is instead a scale and which is which is interesting.
21:30
It's like, well, you know, you don't.
You can, you can survive around by putting out enough, you know, damage as opposed to just like defending yourself.
That can be very fun and dramatic, and there's all sorts of neat ways that can be manipulated.
I think the scale is a good example of like the way that this game emphasizes like atmosphere and narrative over gameplay.
21:51
Because like from a gameplay perspective, I think the scale kind of sucks because it never, it doesn't tell you how much.
There's not like a life total where you're like, oh, I have to deal 7 damage to this guy to win the fight.
You sort of have to eyeball it using the scale and you can like highlight over it and it gives you a sort of a highlighted indication of like how many, but like it's not.
22:14
At the top of it there are little tick marks.
It took me a long time to re realize that but.
Yeah.
But that's what I'm saying.
Like you have like the visual little tick marks, but it is not it is not like the point of it is not to portray information to you in the easiest to understand way.
22:30
It is not like slay the Spire where it's like, OK, here is the number of the damage that your attack will deal.
It's like you have to kind of interpret how it will work by like the gold teeth falling into the other thing.
It's just like, and like the controls of this game are also like kind of weirder than you would think.
22:52
It's not just like pick a card in your hand to place in a slot.
You have to like literally like, you know, adjust your view to either be looking at the board or looking at your hand.
And the reason for that, another kind of like example of like a little shock that plays with your expectations is after you die, like the second time, your opponent tells you to stand up and you're like, what?
23:16
What is even talking about?
And like you press, you know, S on the on the keyboard twice and like your character actually gets up from the board and you can walk around this cabin.
And like, to me, that's another example of a thing that like doesn't seem that weird if you don't have expectations.
23:33
But like if you come in thinking that this is just another like rogue like deck builder and then all of a sudden there's this 3D environment you can walk around in.
It's pretty wild.
And walk around when you're looking at the tower.
Yeah, Oh my God.
Yeah, that was definitely wild.
23:49
And as as soon as I stood up, I I heard like the first couple of chords from the the Doom soundtrack and I was like, whoa, whoa, maybe this is my my FPS adrenal glands started tingling for a moment.
24:05
But no, yeah, I thought that was a very good reveal.
And then also an exciting reveal was the first time I saw my card in gameplay, I had I had like forgotten about the Game over sequence.
I'm like, what is our card that says, Andrew, what is going on?
But that is just a lapse in attention span, obviously.
24:24
Yeah.
That that is that is an interesting point that you're making, Woody.
It's like, well, this is a good little reveal if you are sort of, you know, conditioned for that reveal through your previous game game.
I didn't watch.
24:40
Through Act 3, then I take it like the like the there's a very big theme around or maybe maybe you did see this, but like it'll actually go into your hard drive.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Profiles and your friends on Steam.
And if you play this on something besides the PC.
24:59
You know, I, I played this on my Steam Deck in airplane mode when it was not connected to the Internet.
And so I was a little suspicious, like later, you know, later on in the game when it says it's connecting and doing stuff to the Internet, I'm like, it's not really.
25:16
Yeah, but not really.
I I don't know how that I don't know how that mechanic works.
I think that's dependent on like other people having, you know, your friends list, having played inscription or something like that.
I don't yeah, I know.
But like, I was curious, like if you play this on, you know, a switch and there's that weird bots where it goes into your you have to locate big files on your computer.
25:35
Like I don't know how that would work.
On a that was especially worrying for me on the Steam Deck 'cause I'm like, I have no idea where any of the files on a Linux.
System are.
And I'm just like blindly looking for like, what's something that's bigger than 45 bytes?
How about this?
And then, you know, it, it, it does.
25:51
It's that thing's mechanic earlier.
But I remember the first time I was playing through that particular sequence that we'll get to and eventually in Act 3 and I was like this, is this really going to delete this 3 gigabyte file off of my computer?
Well, and they ask you for the old, like you're supposed to find an old file for that particular segment.
26:10
So you usually find like some system file that was created when like you got your computer and then.
Like a full journal that I wrote in a PDA or in a in a Word document and.
And he's like, if you fail, I'm going to delete this.
Yeah, It's, it's, it's clever.
26:25
It's, it's goofy.
So.
He's got to make sure not to play it on his main computer, because then he would have had to have selected the Flak, lossless Flak files for our episodes.
And that's a no, no, no.
We can't risk those.
I, I want to, so I want to kind of cruise through the first act a little bit and then we'll come back to it when we talk about Casey's mod.
26:46
So basically like you play this sort of grid battler and there's you can, you know, there's not a lot of necessarily synergy between your cards.
It's just about sort of making a giant OP card with some of the various stops along the way.
27:03
But once you beat the boss, you're like, OK, great.
I beat this roguelike game, and that was pretty good, I guess.
Well.
Well, before you do that, I think we probably need to expand a little bit more about the cabin stuff.
Sure.
Like, yeah.
That's fair.
So you're very early on in the game, the cards will start talking to you also, right?
27:22
Another sort of 4th wall breaking sequence and you're like oh, they're like giving me hints to beat the boss.
Oh this is great.
I can like finally.
No, no, Scott, I think the dev said himself in the the the the development interview diary trailer that that's just a fun little like Easter egg that he put in.
27:42
You're right, which that's an excellent video.
Everyone should go watch the the dev seems like a a funny film like they.
Weren't talking to me in my game.
Well, this game also has like a bunch of like crazy real world.
I I mean, is it ARPG?
What's the what's the talk for like real world like go out and find things, solve puzzles in them.
28:04
I I think it's like, I think it's ARPG, right?
Yeah.
And it, it's super like, I don't know, it, it is just very weird when you, you get on to the wiki for like these kind of games or the Reddit forums and you like pull up these spreadsheets of people having deciphered all of these codes and like actually going to these physical locations and finding things.
28:26
And you just, I just wonder, like, who are, who are these people and how do they have the time and the effort and the smarts and the interest to do all this?
And why aren't they the president?
Yeah.
Dedicated gamers.
I mean.
I interrupted you, Scott.
28:41
Yes, the cards start talking to.
You, yeah, the cards start talking to you, they start giving you hints and and like, crucially, they say you should go check out this thing over here in the cabin.
And you go and check out the thing.
You're like, oh, there's there's like little puzzles laid out all over the place where this is your kind of escape room sequence of like, oh, if I turn the knob on the safe to here and to here and you get a clue from the from the help look up book and you do stuff to like unlock you.
29:11
Can get you can get totems that like affect all of your creatures of a certain type.
So like it would give all your wolves flying or like a thorn ability.
And one of the best things you can get in the cabin is like the body of a squirrel.
So you can give all your free squirrel resource cards like some built in ability.
29:30
And that is another way that the game very much is like, all right, it's time for you to win this act because the squirrel, the squirrel powers are pretty ridiculous.
Yeah, that's like a a step change in your ability to defeat stuff.
Yeah, it's probably also worth mentioning too, that the little puzzles that they have in the room and then they have throughout the game really are, I think a really interesting way of introducing upcoming mechanics.
29:55
Because they're like, they're like they they basically have like things you haven't seen yet in the the game so far, like a like a mechanics of like a card or something.
And they they're like, hey, try and solve this puzzle to like get 55 out of five damage.
And and you really have no idea what the fuck that thing does unless maybe rule book or something.
30:11
And so you're just like basically moving tiles around like you're either waiting to learn how it actually works or just moving tiles around until you eventually like, crack the code.
So just kind of guess.
It took me an embarrassingly long time the first time to understand what was going on.
Yeah, no, I was just like, why are moving these tiles around and click a button and something happens?
30:27
Like did not grok that it was a simulation of a battle.
But I, I just think that was a really neat idea in a way of having people engage and really want to try to like, not learn, but at least engage with it so that they get the special card or whatever the perk is behind the the puzzle.
30:45
So, so as act one progresses and you are like losing multiple times, like these talking cards will start to morph themselves where they will change shape from a, a lowly stout to or stout to a a stout rectangularly headed, a weird looking thing that's like a a mutated robot.
31:12
One of them starts to turn into something resembling a person.
And then I don't know what happens to Wolfie, but but they start transforming the more that you're playing and they start giving you hints of like, go to the clock and get, get the film roll from there.
31:28
And you know, get make sure to release the dagger so you can use the dagger as a special item for later.
And I remember Andrew posting in the in the discord of using the the dagger to gouge out your eyeball for the first time.
31:43
Yeah, I mentioned that that great scale mechanic, you can put your finger on the scale by the way of pulling out your own teeth and throwing those on the scale and pulling out your own eyeball, which those were some definitely memorable moments, first time you encountered those.
32:04
But eventually, yeah, so you you unlock all these OP cards, you eventually have like a meta progression mechanic by dying enough that you're building like these super death cards and you're fighting through the bosses.
You're fighting through the the miner who's pickaxing your cards and turning them to gold.
32:24
You're fighting through the the the angler who uses his hook to steal your cards and pull them to the other side of the boards.
And now they're his you're you're facing the the duality of the trapper and the traitor, which was a a neat mind blowing mechanic the first time that I played.
32:41
I'm like, do you mean the mask was the same the whole time?
Yeah, when when you fight these bosses, this sort of eye, the eye glowing eyes in the back will hold up a mask in front of its face.
It's just it, it does really like this game does a really tremendous job of committing to the atmosphere that it's created of just being like, OK, you are in an, you are in a dark cabin with one other.
33:03
One madman who has like trapped you here and he's like.
Play a game with me and friend.
Yeah, exactly.
And then eventually you fight the final boss, which is the the eye eyeball, dark darkness man himself from from across the table, who uses all of the mechanics from the previous mini bosses that you fought to to battle with you.
33:29
And you you beat through beat through that twice.
And then you have to fight, of course, the moon, like every good Rook, like video game and beating that eventually gets you.
I think he I think he kills you anyway, or like his.
33:47
Drag.
No, you you take the camera.
And film before that, though, 'cause like, I think he's, he's like, you know, oh, I think we're done here.
And then like tries to like drag you basically to the death room that you've been to before, but because you're you're talking cards have given you hints to get the film roll from before you wrestle the camera away from him, put the film roll in the camera and take his picture.
34:14
And then now the final boss has been captured in the camera and victory is yours.
Hooray.
Inscription is 1.
Congrats everyone.
Let's move on to final ranking.
Yeah, and this is this is sort of the big, I mean, this is sort of I think the the pinnacle of the game moment to some extent.
34:34
Because like you wake up, you your character essentially wakes up and finds themselves in a room with like the only thing floating is the icon for new game.
That was like grayed out at the start menu of this game where it only had continue.
34:52
You find the icon for new game and then you're essentially stuck in this room and you're like, OK, I found the icon from new game and you actually have to exit out of the game, like back to the main menu and then select new game, which is just.
35:08
I didn't like that it took me a really long time both times to get to that point.
I'm just like, I don't know.
I I just like went on the Internet and was like what, what, what did I break?
Because no, but, and, and seriously though, because like, this game is not the kind of game like, it makes you feel like, Oh yeah, you should just keep walking into the darkness or something.
35:31
Something's gonna happen eventually, right?
But you, yeah, I see You're saying you just were stuck in, you just kind of hung out in the cabin.
Yeah, for like 5 minutes trying to like poke around it.
I was like, well I need to poke it.
Am I missing some like corner that I just haven't tried?
And like every other part of the game, it rewards you for like poking around until you find the thing that you missed.
35:53
And this one is like, well, no, you're not actually missing anything.
We're not going to tell you that.
It should put like a like they they should have like a something like quit game or or just some subtle hint that.
Some maybe something that made it obvious that your game was saved like or I, I mean, I don't know, but I, I don't know.
36:12
I I think it's.
Your game was saved and it wasn't like glitched or frozen in some way.
Right.
Because I think that's probably the fear is you're like, oh, I beat him.
I don't want to exit out now and like lose the record of me beating him.
And yeah, it's it's interesting playing through the second time because there's, and I'm sure we'll get to this later, but like the like the meta narrative overarching the game, like feel like this feels like a very appropriate moment of like, is the game busted?
36:41
Like is it broken?
Like the whole game so far has only just been this act one deck building experience.
There hasn't been anything else so far.
And then like when that's over, it's like, well, now what?
And then you you start a new game, but before that you go into a full motion video live action recorded sequence of the main character talking about how he discovered this game.
37:11
Luke Luke Carter AKA the Lucky Carter who is like has a YouTube channel where he opens old packs of card games.
You know he does.
He does pack polls.
And you're watching it on like a weird night like 2002 video camera.
37:33
And I, I just want this is not like a super thing.
We have to get it.
But like, I think the guy who plays Luke is great.
Like, I think that he like, I mean, the acting of like, yeah, the, the skill of acting for people is not something that comes up all that often on a roguelike podcast.
37:51
But like, I think this guy does a really excellent job of just being like a very believable dork who posts on YouTube and is like excited about old card games.
And I just think it's a really cool extra thing for this game to explore Is like the weird sort of like, like it's just it's something that isn't, you know, explored a lot as an idea is like, what about these Youtubers who open old, you know, card packs?
38:19
It's just like a weird thing to draw creativity from.
And I think his performance really sells it.
There's there's a point later where there's another actor, this woman who comes in as a representative from the company and she is like very off putting and not, not terrible in that.
38:34
Room.
Yeah, Terrible.
She is very terrible and like I well, it's weird.
It's like, well, they're like set up like, oh, there's throwing like a threatening emissary from like this corporation is going to his door.
And she is like this woman who is way shorter than him and has absolutely like no presence.
38:55
And it's worth pointing out.
Leggings.
It's It's also worth pointing out that Woody does have pretty extensive theatre acting experience too.
So I feel like if if there's I mean like, I'm in no place to to criticize someone's acting technique, but what he sure is, but I.
Played German man in high school.
39:11
I said 2 words on that German man.
Look, I'm, I'm not even saying like her performance has to be great.
Like it's not.
But like there's just like, yeah, the the role is just like, OK, this needs to be an intimidating person that has like this sort of sense of terror being instilled.
39:29
And it's just like, that is not the case at all.
It's one of the few, it's one of the few really weird missteps that this game.
Takes it reads high school class projects vibes like the presidential campaigns we had to do for AP Gov where we were fake presidents.
And it's like, well, these are the four people we have in our group.
39:47
So I guess you're the one who's the the FBI agent.
And yeah, I guess it would also be less surprising if, like, the guy who played Luke was also kind of was not very convincing.
But like I said, I think he does a great job.
And so you see a video, lots of videos with him, and then she shows up later and you're like, wait, what's going on with this?
40:04
She's got the mirrored aviators on, isn't that?
Isn't that scary?
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, it's it's it's a bummer.
Maybe perhaps it could have been salvage with some ADR or some a different camera angle and he's.
A different actor.
40:20
One would argue, one could argue, perhaps, I don't know if I'm willing to make this argument, that it it makes the final scene with her all the more surprising that she's not intimidating.
And then maybe you don't expect what might happen later.
I forgot like I knew how this game generally ended because there's this big like credits epilogue within the game that is very memorable and crazy.
40:42
But then like it goes back to the live action video and like she I mean, I'm just we we already said spoilers.
So she just comes in and shoots Luke in the head.
It's just execute game.
Yeah, the game is a.
Rifle, mind you, no IS.
It a rifle?
No way.
Really.
40:57
Is it a JOP or a pistol?
You're not.
You're not gonna like, come up to someone's front door.
They're not gonna open the door if they see you holding the rifle.
No.
No.
I think it's a weird, I think it's a weird unnecessary way to end the game.
Like to me, like, I think that almost like just the like game crashing would almost be a better way to end it.
41:16
Or like a a a loss or something.
They should just.
Restart your computer.
But there's probably laws against.
That I think so you get like, I was thinking about it like as you're playing through the third act and like this would be a great way to like actually hack someone's computer be like.
41:33
Ha ha ha.
It's part of the game.
Let them see my.
File then it's like, no, it's actually just a virus.
Yeah, this is.
True.
Anyway, so you once you've seen these videos like Luke finds sort of this disc for inscription, I think oh to.
This point has only been a a physical card game in the game in the game in the universe, so that's being presented to you.
41:54
Yeah, that's right.
He like finds booster packs at a yard sale, which Facebook Reels keeps trying to recommend to me.
Like people thrifting and finding old video games.
Like I don't want to watch this Facebook reels.
I don't care about people finding old video games anyway, so stop it, Facebook.
42:10
Anyway, so he finds these, he finds these packs and like there is like coordinates on them.
Or, or one of the one of the cards has lat long coordinates written on it, which is super cool.
That's that's pretty near here.
42:26
And then he like it like abruptly stops recording, like with the intent of like he's onto a mission here.
And then like you have video recorded sequences of him like out in the woods, like digging, like, like actually digging into the dirt, which I'm like, what the hell is happening right now?
42:43
Like I was just playing a video game and now I'm watching some guy dig holes in the forest.
And then he, yeah, he finds this a floppy disk, which is I.
Love I love that after this they even have this scene of him browsing on eBay finding a floppy disk like USB player.
43:01
Like that's just a really good detail.
And then he loads it up and this is where our story begins because this is this I think is where like the game kind of pulls like a Metal Gear Solid 2 rug pull on you of like this is actually the game like inscription is actually act 2.
43:21
And when you go to replace one of the scribes at the end of this main Pokémon overworld game, that's when it jumps into like the death card cabin sequence.
That's when it jumps into the the technology robot sequence.
43:39
And then you would play like those little mini experiences and then like beating that is like the the quote UN quote finale.
But then you had this like completely insane meta narrative, like way over the top of it.
That's like all the other stuff.
43:55
So yeah, act two goes from a what has been so far a 3D escape room roguelike game into a top down Pokémon trading card game for the Game Boy Color.
And you're like did.
44:10
You guys ever play Pokémon trading card game for the Game Boy Color?
I almost failed 6th grade because of that game.
Yeah, that game is really addictive, Yeah.
Yeah, I I certainly have played it.
Yeah, it's it's.
Much red, blue, yellow.
I think that was about it.
No this.
44:26
Is like the trade.
The trade yeah, this real Pokémon, this is the.
Trading card game, but in Game Boy form.
It's kind of a weird game because there's still like an overworld and you're walking around like a regular Pokémon game, but instead of like actually having your animals fight, you're like pulling out your cards.
44:45
It's like one level too deep because it's, it's a card game based off a video game, but then you made a video game based off the card game.
It's like, well, we already had the video game.
I think, I mean, I think it works really well because like this was one of the few like the few games out that like was a full-fledged card game that was like you could bring this game portable with you.
45:05
And the Pokémon Trading Game is really a pretty rudimentary card game.
And like, it has a ton of dice of coin flipping, which is just super tedious, like in person.
And so, like, having the game do this for you makes it a lot faster.
45:21
Yeah, Like that's like half the mechanic of the Pokémon Trading Card Game is flipping coins, and your attacks do damage based on that.
I've never I I mean I collected Pokémon cards in like 5th grade but I never.
You never read them.
I never played the game, I just got the pretty pictures you never found.
45:37
Ordinance on.
Them and hid them away.
But yes, Woody, as as soon as I got to Act 2, we had like a whole conversation on on Discord about, oh, this looks a lot like this other game certainly and certainly evokes that, that style.
45:53
And right at the top here, like you can pick your starting deck and hear the game expands the number of mechanics significantly.
Like you can pick the starting deck of Leshi, who is the the scribe you fought in the cabin.
And then it has the same sacrificing creatures mechanic to pay for new creatures.
46:11
But then there's also a scribe of the dead that pays for things using bones by having your creatures die.
And then there is the technology scribe, which I can't remember the name of the the computer.
Yeah, which?
Uses energy P03 I think OK.
46:27
Oh, I can't believe I can't remember that super memorable name.
Yeah.
So you make conduits between your cards on the grid and then the last one is the Magic scribe which is you play cards that give you mana which you can use to summon more you.
46:43
Know some of the least fun one, right?
Yeah, it's undeniably the least fun because it has the Magic Gathering problem of mana screw where you like, draw a bunch of creatures but no gems to actually play them, or you draw a bunch of gems and no creatures.
But it's but also with the addition of you're using a valuable spots.
47:00
You only have 4 spots in your life.
Well, now I have two of them filled with mana that does nothing.
And the yeah, so this is AI think a good example of well, so I think Act 1 of this game is very good.
And I think that the ideas in the rest of the game are like, I think the narrative of the rest of the game is great and super interesting and makes the game what it is.
47:21
But like, from a gameplay perspective, I think it's all downhill.
Like I think the game.
Yeah, I think like thank God that you've you came onto this podcast that you that you arrived Woody in the nick of time to be the one to say it.
47:36
I thought I was going to have.
To do the.
One, I think we all we all agree with that act one was the peak of the game.
The rest of it's downhill.
But they got the weird zaniness that's like, oh, that's interesting on all the ridiculous novelty that's just kind of pouring out of an otherwise kind of like, you know, OK, game, I guess, is what keeps you going.
47:56
I do think it is really like, I really had a lot of nostalgia for the way that this Act 2 looks.
And it's fun to make the decks and it's very cool that you can like mix and match and be like, all right, I'm going to try doing the machines with some skeletons so when they die, I can, you know, it's like playing multiple colors and Magic.
48:15
But again, like there's just not really enough cards and all.
I mean, there's only about maybe 20 opponents that you fight over the course of the whole game. 16 to 20 it's like 3 because there's four overall scribes you have to defeat, kind of like a gym leader, and each one of them has two or three lackeys that you need to defeat.
48:35
Is it four?
OK, anyway, misremembering actually and the.
You beat 44 bosses and each one of those bosses has three underlings, so I think.
There's 16, I think that sounds right actually, because there's like gravestones.
I remember there being three that you had to like complete.
And it's just like, there's not enough cards.
48:52
And sort of like, once you find a deck that kind of works and you're winning, you have really no incentive to change it up, even when you get new cards.
And so, like, I really struggled with beating some of the first few guys when I just had my starting deck.
But like, once I started to get more cards, I just, like, cruised through this.
49:11
Yeah.
Because also it's like, crucially, you're, you're not doing any trading.
You're only just like continuously adding to your deck.
And then you're figuring out like, what what combination of stuff do I want to build out my deck with from this big pool of stuff that I've accumulated?
49:28
And then yeah, like there's not, there's not like enough fights for it to be like a fully fleshed out quote UN quote game.
It's almost like this transitionary element.
Well, and that's what's so weird about Inscription as a whole.
And like this whole, like, I don't know what the solution is because I think that to make this act better, it needs to be more flushed out and like, it needs to be a bigger world and there needs to be more cards.
49:52
So you're actually challenged to try and experiment with the deck building.
There needs to be there.
Needs to be something where you like one deck, can't be all of the other decks.
Like, there's no incentive to be like, Oh, well, this deck counters this deck.
Yeah.
Exactly, every deck by being better than by just having power.
50:11
The the problem is though, like I, I agree, agree with you, Colin, and it it I wish it was more fleshed out like that, but I also don't want it to be any longer than it is because like you're so kind of engaged with like what is this weird game that you're like really excited to see what the next thing is?
50:31
And it's hard for these sort of act two and three to not feel a little tedious because you're kind of engaged with like, what is going on in this overall story.
I think Act Act 2 serves the purpose of explaining the end of Act three because like it sets up that there are like, oh, that first guy that you beat in Act 10, he's just one of like four other bosses in the like four other like main bosses.
51:00
But these are like, these are like real life.
I mean quote, UN quote real life in the world of like Luke, like these are like real sort of demonic presences that well.
Like if if you were like playing the physical edition of inscription, you know, you would have like your electricity type cards, that would be Leshi and your psychic type cards, that would be Grimura's cards, etcetera, etcetera.
51:26
And then like, Oh my God, there's this like video game version.
And then like, oh, there's like, well I don't know if it's explicitly said that they are like like self aware sentient things at this point in Act 2.
Right.
51:41
But there is like, I think that I don't know.
I think what this game is going for is like real indication of like, say, you know, satanic demonic forces that have like infiltrated this card game playing company and like, resulted in like the death of an employee.
51:59
Like, yeah, that's I think that's what, and that's why I think that it has a lot of like creepypasta vibes.
In fire like circumstances, you, you never listeners.
You never want to find yourself in fire like circumstances.
That's a bad state of being.
Let me tell you what I I, we just recently reviewed Slay the Spire, one of the finest games around, legitimately very good.
52:25
And I lodged a sort of soft complaint that it's like, you know, it's supposed to be a deck builder.
I'm not really getting to properly build my deck.
What's the deal?
Come on, I don't get enough opportunities to add and modify and customize.
Well, guess what, Andrew Harshman, here's your opportunity in Act 2 of inscription.
52:43
And I immediately like Pooh poohed that idea.
And I was like, like, eh, auto complete.
I don't want to do that.
Yeah, I mean, it's very tedious.
I fought that for a while, but then once actually started engaging with like building the deck around, I don't know, I guess let's see.
52:58
I beat Leshi and then I went to go fight Skeleton Spooky Spooky Jones down at the Skeleton Hut.
What's?
What's the name of that character?
No, you had it.
It's spooky.
Jones, the skeleton Hut.
Like Gamora.
Gamora, the Scribe of the Dead.
53:14
Which is a cool name, Gamora, the Scribe of the dead.
Then I'm like, OK, now I actually have to like make something that's worth a worth a hoot.
And, you know, initially for my meathead FPS brain, that was a little bit difficult.
But, oh, once I, you know, started working, working with the, the deck building system, it was fun.
53:33
But sounds like that was not the experience that y'all had.
Y'all found something good and rocked with it.
Yeah, I, I, I tend to agree.
It's it's, it's good that this segment is not too much longer.
Yeah, I, I remember Act 2 the first time I played it being like novel at first and then just kind of being a slog by like the last couple bosses.
53:54
And then I was just like.
I don't know, that's the thing that's so weird about inscription as a whole.
It's like, I think I would happily play a game that was just Act 2 that was more fleshed out.
Like I would have been all about this game for like Game Boy Color or something that had more cards and more mechanics or like the ability to trade with other people or, you know, a sort of more of that.
54:19
But like sandwiched in after you've played like this pretty cool, atmospheric, sort of more mechanically rich roguelike.
It just feels a little underwhelming.
But aside from the shock of like, what is going on anyway?
So you make your way through this, and regardless of what what, regardless of what character, what scribe you've chosen to replace PO3, the supercomputer like takes over the game at this point.
54:46
Yeah.
And turns into a 3D model.
I knew, Oh my, uh oh, that's, that's not good.
And I love the aesthetic.
I love the aesthetic of like the the screen getting like errored out in places.
55:01
And you're just like, is my like my computer's not actually crashing right now, right?
It just has like just enough believability to it that you're like just a little on edge and you're like, I know the game is still playing, but.
Just that that that 1%.
Is this game actually a virus?
55:18
Have I installed a virus on my computer and it's now crashing it?
Andrew, you should really go in without like looking up anything about this.
Game and turn off your antivirus while you play also so.
I think this is a good example of what will brought up in the like I I am I am famously amongst knowledgeable circles, anti jazz.
55:38
But I do know I do think that this is a good example of what will is talking about because it's like act 2 brings in a lot of mechanics that you saw in the first game and then sort of sets up a lot of new ones that you see in act three and then act three just kind of brings it all together.
55:59
It's like you, there's a lot of these little smatterings of things and then like that, these act one and two really set up.
And then act 3 is like, all right, we're going to draw from this pool because now you understand sort of what the basic structure is and we're going to find lots more ways to kind of alter the tempo and things like that.
56:18
I, I there's also like visually it's very cool because it's similar to act one where you're up against this supercomputer sitting across from you, but it's like a holographic board with like a, you know, dot matrix hologram.
56:34
And you can look down and you see your blah manacled to the like metal desk.
What do you I have a very important question though.
All jazz or just some?
I mean, really, That's fair.
Right.
That's fair.
Hashtag, hashtag.
Not all jazz.
All right?
That's Yeah, that's not that's not fair.
56:49
Take it to your own jazz Jazz pro con this.
Is gonna be the Bebop Jazz podcast.
Now we're gonna be talking about Bill Evans for the rest of this session.
I I did think, I do think that that was an apartment comparison for this game, though.
Yeah.
And I think that much like Act 2, like this is a very cool transition.
57:06
And when you start it and like each time you see a new mechanic in act three, you're like, oh, that's a really cool mechanic.
Because there's a lot of like taking a sort of your cards are essentially floppy disks and you can insert them into these drives to give them new abilities.
57:24
This is a much this, this overall, like much more than Act one, allows you to really kind of customize your deck.
But I think that this is probably even, this is even sloggier than Act 2.
I I feel like by the time I was done with Act three, I was really ready to be done with Act 3.
57:44
It it adds way too much of the like overworld stuff, Which is it?
It has a fun aesthetic for like one minute and then you're like, it's not really fun to look at, though.
It's as fun as a it's a it's it's fun as like this is the game like a kid in a cartoon is playing in the background kind of thing.
58:06
You're like fun a video game and.
I mean, that's like, I think an issue with this game in general, which is I think the only part of this game that is like mechanically very good is the first act.
And like the rest of the game is so idea rich and creative that I still really like it, but it's not really fun to play the way that the first act actually.
58:33
Is it transitions from like gameplay mechanics to like gameplay narrative in a way.
But yeah, like Act 3 is like is like if you took the 3D modelled escape room sequence from Act one and applied that to like the top down Pokémon world of Act of Act 2.
58:53
Like I didn't realize it the first time I was playing it, but this time when I was playing, I'm like, oh, the the map that you're playing through in Act 3 is literally just the map from Act 2, maybe with like a little like a little bit expanded here and there.
But instead of going to Leshy's cabin from Act 2, you're going to the foul backwater, as it's called by the robot who says he's he's made improvements to the game after taking it over improvements in air quotes.
59:21
And I, I love the little detail that he calls all the other scribes like layers with all these like pejorative nouns of like the foul backwater or like filthy corpse world or gaudy gem land.
And then you have when you go to to P03's factory equivalent in this overworld, it's called the Resplendent Bastion.
59:44
Listeners, Scott actually has little cute nicknames like this on Discord for us.
It's kind of rude, actually, Yeah.
With regards to how much of A slog it is.
I I, I didn't realize that initially.
Initially I couldn't get past like the first couple of fights and like act act three and we're talking on Discord and it's like somebody mentioned getting lost and I'm like, Oh no, there's going to be some navigation.
1:00:08
So I'm like, all right, I'll do it right.
Let me get out my, my scratch paper and immediately my little drawing like went off the page like immediately.
I'm just like, oh fuck, what am I going to do here?
Soon after I'm like, yeah, we're going, we're going to a gameplay video.
1:00:24
I'm I'm sorry, I can't.
Were you were you guys?
Actually getting lost.
I know Colin mentioned it, but I I don't know if that.
Like that just was like how?
Dare you.
I got lost the first time I played because there are some aspects of like of this like like room by room sequence that you're traversing almost kind of like a Zelda dungeon.
1:00:42
And they're like it loops around itself in some, in some instances and.
Like I mean graphically it all kind of looks the same.
True.
But until you realize like, oh, actually it was just, it's, it's basically just a map from Act 2.
And then like I completely forgot what Act 2 looked like from the overworld perspective.
1:00:58
So I yeah, like I would get lost and I'd be like, oh damn, I lost that fight.
And then you have this dark soul style like loop drop mechanic where you lose all of your money and then you have to like you are lifted up by like a drone and then like dropped earlier at a checkpoint.
1:01:13
You have to like fight your way back to your money to get.
Yeah, I, I, I don't know, I think that this this section is kind of just the least inspired.
Like I'm not crazy mechanically about like the sacrificing creatures to play new ones, but like that is pretty different than most other card games.
1:01:31
And in this section they just have like the Hearthstone, you gain another man at every turn mechanic, which is intuitive.
But like eventually like I don't know, to me it consistently comes down like survive till you get 6 mana and then play the guy who has two attack and like the forced attack, like the double gunner just like deals a bunch of damage.
1:01:53
And so it's just kind of consistently like that and the only real new mechanic or like the main new mechanic is like a crosshair that allows certain creatures to attack any square on the board, which is pretty useful and like is really easy to break like this.
1:02:08
This section in general is like pretty easy to just make some nuts cards.
Like you could just make a turret that auto fires and give it like the death touch ability so it automatically kills anything it hurts.
And it's just like, all right, I'll just draw this every time.
And yeah, again, it's just like it's similar to Act 2.
1:02:24
It's like it's cool to see these new mechanics, but the game never really forces you to use them enough and it just becomes too easy.
And you're just kind of like, all right, I'm just going to like cruise through this and I'm you're more, you're more I for me, I'm much more interested in like what's gonna happen next.
1:02:44
So like when PO3 makes me stand up and survive and like solve captcha puzzles, it kind of just feels like all right, game.
You're kind of just wasting my time at this point.
Yeah.
And I think that like, well, I think partially it builds into like the fact that like, PO3 is supposed to be the bad guy of, of like, of, of these characters and like really?
1:03:08
Yeah, was it?
Was anyone bothered by that?
He seemed so helpful in the first act.
Well, as discussed, Will is definitely APO 3, so he he he very much, he very much could relate also.
On the apologist.
On the second playthrough that that helpful stoat that is giving you all the tips at in in act one, I really see he's kind of a jerk.
1:03:30
He's just like you play a card and he's like total missed play.
Why would you do that?
Awful, awful decision.
And then Grimura, who is channeled through the stink bug card in act one, is always like, oh, sweetie, you're just doing such a great job.
I'm so proud of you.
And you really kind of see that character like come like those characters like are very fleshed out before you even realize it, which is very interesting.
1:03:55
So, yeah.
And and so the the the sarcastic robot who I I posted in in the zoom chat here, I'm pretty sure his head was the inspiration for the play date console.
Like the wind up thing that's like, it's like a wind up just.
1:04:11
Watch the review of that.
Yeah.
Game Boy thing it could be it's.
I would have to guarantee that's where the inspiration for it came from.
But anyway.
Also Scott the link you posted is just play dot date which is like a very off putting web page to just click on.
1:04:28
Right, it's.
Going to be bought out by the match group any minute now without realizing what it is so.
It looks like the IT looks like Bumble.
It's got the orange and yellow and black.
Anyway, well, let's let's keep so.
Act three, Yeah.
So Act three, you are, you're going through and you're fighting the four bosses again, the same kind of sequence from Act 2.
1:04:50
But there's a bit of A twist that you don't, that you're not realizing what you're getting yourself into here because you go to Leshi's cabin equivalent here.
You fight the photographer boss who takes, you are taking pictures with this camera for something.
1:05:08
And then you you beat that boss, you're like, and then the PO3 is like very interesting photos you took there.
Wink, wink.
You go to Grimoire's crypt, whose boss fight has the the mechanic of, as we discussed before, like you, a granting inscription access to your hard drive.
1:05:27
That comes up with a a fun prompt that you're like, I sure, why not?
You click and then you use that as a means of like tilting the scale by putting like GB sized files which do like 5 damage or whatever.
You go to gaudy Gen. land where there's an unfinished boss and you you set the rules for that boss of like how you want to fight them.
1:05:54
Basically quote completing the game and then in P zeros 3 factory you fight golly who connects to the Internet to to get your steam friends engaged in combat with you.
1:06:10
And you are fighting the steam profiles of of other people in your friends list and seeing Andrew's card come down and Will's card or like profile picture like from steam come down with like numerical attributes tied to them.
Like first time I was playing through, I'm like, oh Oh my God, what is happening?
1:06:29
This thing, it really is using my computer and connecting to the Internet in a very unsettling way.
And Scott, I don't want to, I don't want to belittle you here, but I just got to say you were a pretty weak ass card.
Like I just, I just defeated your your your steam profile in one shot.
1:06:46
Yeah, that sounds about right.
And then once you have beaten all four of these bosses, you go back to the the four headstones to, to finish the great Transcendence, which has been kind of being dripped with info here and there like no, no, no, we've got to, we've got to finish the great transcendence.
1:07:09
Everything will become clear once the great Transcendence has.
And yeah, and So what is what is the great transcendence?
It's PO3 is like you have made you finished inscription the game and now he's ready to put it out on the Steam marketplace to infect and have control over everyone's computers.
1:07:28
Yeah, you, you have taken the last step where so we've kind of talked a little bit about the meta narrative thus far of the someone in the inscription physical card factory had made this game, this digital game that then became self aware and was getting out of control.
1:07:49
So they buried it.
But somehow the coordinates to that thing got onto one of the cards and into Luke Carter's hands.
He goes and digs it up, plugs it into his computer.
And these self aware sentient computer programs have have, well, I guess PO3 in particular has a motivation of, well, we're going to escape out into the Internet and then nothing can stop me.
1:08:17
And so the great transcendence is, yeah, like literally uploading the game to Steam for digital distribution.
And then there will be thousands of copies of inscription out on the Internet.
But the other 3 scribes have a plan.
1:08:34
And so this is where you, you something happens in P03's factory where like, oh stamp security camera keeps going offline.
You need to go check it out.
Human slave.
You go down, you solve some more capture puzzles and you go down into an area that like act 2.
1:08:52
There's, there's lots of like narrative parallels here where like an Act 2, there's this like distorted like bugged card that goes through a sequence of like dredging it up from this old data that that the game is involved with, again, very kind of creepypasta augmented RPG real life kind of deal thing.
1:09:13
And you go down in like the act three equivalent of that.
And that's where the other scribes are hiding.
And they have this plan of, all right, as soon as PO3 tries to enact the great transcendence, we're going to kill him.
Like, OK, great, that sounds good to me.
1:09:31
And then the great transcendence happens.
And then P03 turns to the camera and says, thank you, Luke, for unleashing me to the Internet.
And then you he like, from this perspective, we're so far, the game that you've been playing has been like a recorded camera of the screen.
1:09:48
He's like, oh shit, oh shit, what's just happened?
And then you see Leshy's hands reach out from behind like you've seen so many times before, grab the robot by the head and just RIP his head off, sparks flying everywhere, and that's it.
1:10:04
The great transcendence has been, has been.
Cancelled, cancelled and then Gomorrah.
I believe with with, not with without, the collaboration of the other scribes decides to essentially delete inscription.
1:10:20
That's for the leading the game from within itself.
Yeah.
And and then so you at this point, you've essentially beat the game and you go on this sort of long series of cutscenes where you're kind of seeing the gameplay mechanic, if any, if all, because you've seen the gameplay mechanic if like Leshi in Act one, you've seen like, OK, what is inscription if Leshi is in charge and you've seen what is inscription if PO3 is in charge.
1:10:45
And then it shows you like Gamora has a version of this game.
It's kind of like a weird, creepy underground tomb and the arms reach out and like, knock on the board.
Yeah, exactly.
And then I don't, I don't think it's really possible to fail any of these.
1:11:01
But they are cool sort of, again, different sort of jazz riffs on like, what this game could have been, you know, just as different ways to approach it.
And then you see, I don't even remember the name of the magician scribe.
Magnificent.
1:11:17
Yeah, he looks like, it looks like that McDonald's character Grimace.
He's a big purple guy.
Grimace.
Yeah, he looks like Grimace, but like Christmas tree Grimace.
And it is a very cool, like, yeah, PS1 aesthetic, but you have like battle discs and you're looking down at above and summoning different characters again.
1:11:35
It it's it's all cool and weird, but it's not like, yeah, it's not mechanically rich.
It's just interesting.
And I think it's important to point out in this kind of like epilogue sequence or like pre epilogue sequence, maybe like this, this ending sequence that like epilogue.
1:11:51
That's a good word for it that like everything is being all the game assets are being deleted as you are playing with them.
So like if there was like a risk that you were going to fail, like the scale like deletes and disappears.
And like as you are, as you're playing Remora's game, like it's like, OK, like you're playing through like one, one phase of of like of her game.
1:12:14
And then you get to this boss fight.
The boss has been deleted.
And then she's like, OK, well, we would have had a great time together.
But I can see that it's getting a little late.
I can tell that you're getting getting tired this.
This it's kind of, it's interesting that like they find kind of a bittersweet, like emotional thing.
1:12:33
Like you interact with Leshi again, unless she's like, hey, we had a we had a lot of good times together in act one, but I kept killing you.
Remember that?
And you're like, yeah, we did have some good times, Leshi, But it's kind of cool to see these characters that, you know, seem so ominous being like, hey, we just, we just wanted to play this weird game.
1:12:50
Together, yeah.
And like when you're fight, when you're placing Lushi, like when you lose, which I'm pretty sure you do automatically because he's very difficult to beat.
He's just like, we don't need, we don't need to worry about the scales.
Like we could just keep playing.
Yeah.
And he's like, all the stuff around him is being deleted.
1:13:05
And it feels like it has this very like sad like vibe to it of like, I think he has a line of something very poignant of like, you know, you, you only realize the things that you like until like, you don't have enough time to enjoy them anymore or something like that.
1:13:24
And I was just like, why is this game making me sad here?
This guy who was like strangling me to death for hours before, but like, and then he reaches out like with his hand and you, you shake his hand and then he's deleted and you're like, oh, oh.
1:13:40
And then Magnificus happens.
And then so anyway, after that, yeah, I think like Magnificus's game is very much like, you know, that episode of The Simpsons where it's like all those like super short things, like the Super short, like, like mini sods.
1:13:57
And then at the very end, professor. 22 short films about Springfield.
And then Professor Frank comes running up at the end.
He's like, oh, I was, I was going to tell you what I was going to have, but like, I've been so caught up with all the craziness.
But anyway, let's let's do all of the the professor freak show.
And then it starts like rolling to credit.
1:14:13
It's like, no, wait, no, wait.
I still have plenty of stuff to tell you.
Don't wait for me, that feels kind of like his thing and I'm I'm glad that like the the game accelerates that process because I'm like, I don't know if I really want to have the stamina to play through like a whole nother.
No, I was very, the first time I played through this game, I was very worried when the Gamora segment started that I was going to have to play like through an act of like Gamora theme thing of the same mechanic.
1:14:38
So I'm I'm happy.
I think it's very cool that they cram all this stuff at the end and I'm happy the way that they did.
I don't have to play the game anymore.
Yeah, anyway, And then they cut out to the the full motion video again and Luke's dead and the game's over.
Yeah.
Well, you missed you.
Well, we talked about the the Yu-gi-oh fight sequence with PS1 graphics that and then all that stuff gets deleted and magnifics kisses like crawling towards you like, no, wait, there's still, we still need to.
1:15:05
And then he gets deleted and then yeah, the the.
You go touch the old file.
Yeah, don't, don't go looking through that old data, trust me.
Or maybe some of the fan mods, we'll get to that in a minute.
So the game is deleted, the day is saved.
1:15:23
But Luke has been getting some phone calls or he's been making some phone calls to journalists saying, hey, there's this game that has been put out.
I don't know what the deal with this is, but it's hacking my computer and then the guy on the other end of the phone is like, so you're saying you're saying the game is haunted.
1:15:41
What's going on here?
And you can tell it's like some some guy who's like never played a video game before, frantically taking notes.
And then, yeah, he gets he gets a a warning from one of the the game funa security.
I don't know detail people.
1:15:58
I think this is this is at the acts acts 2 to three transition.
That's when like the warning happens and then after Act 3 is when like Luke has like lost his mind playing this game and there's lots of fun sequences of like Blair Witch style like camera running around and him just like cackling maniacally.
1:16:18
Possible house invasion at one point.
Using the term fun very liberally there.
I think as soon as those videos come up every time I'm like, oh God, do I really?
Am I going to?
I'm about to watch a bunch of like clips of this guy and I'm just, it just it started hurting me.
1:16:34
But I guess this is my second playthrough.
Maybe I liked it the first time, I don't remember.
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's not something you encounter in games at all, really, let alone the games that we've been playing.
So it's it's a wacky interlude.
1:16:52
But yeah, like this final sequence is you know, he's he's trying to get someone to come and like tell his story to and the game Funa devs are out to get him and he just gets a knock on the door, opens the door and bam, that's it shot through the heart and he was you're.
1:17:09
To blame, it's.
Going to be.
There was no there was no movement at all after.
No, it was, it was.
It was definitely a headshot.
On on the one hand, like the production of these, these full motion video sections, like they weren't able to cast and direct the game Funa employee super well, but they were able to somehow capture like the he gets shot, the camera hits the ground and then perfectly like a pool of blood comes into camera comes into focus.
1:17:42
And then there are like 2 playing cards that get like soaked with blood and then start floating on the surface.
And like, how did they do that?
Incredible.
Like, so on the one hand, they're, they were able to craft this brilliant shot, but then there's a few spots where they faltered.
1:18:00
Yeah, kind of a dramatic, potentially unnecessary ending to the game.
Yeah, anyway, this game is cool.
It's I think it's very, I mean to me, I think you could almost break like obviously there's infinite ways to categorize things and video games.
1:18:19
But like to me a pretty simple categorization is like, is this a game that you play through once for the narrative story?
Like most sort of, at least for me, like most, you know, RPGs or an action adventure game or something?
1:18:35
Or is this a game that you play through, you know, in multiple, you know, just like lots of different short settings, you know, just over and over like which is more common, you know the style now, like, you know, any, any sports games, any arena shooters.
Any.
1:18:52
Roguelike, any roguelike, any card games and so like that to me is a reason why I don't think this falls very well into the roguelike session that roguelike criteria because like most roguelikes, whether you beat it or not, like the hope is OK.
Like I will probably come back and play this again because I just enjoy the mechanics and like to me this is a game where you play through once and you get then you like the joy comes from the narrative.
1:19:20
Even though not that I had a bad time playing it through a second time, I still think it's really good.
It's just like once a lot of those surprises are removed, it is less good than the first time that you played.
1:19:35
Yeah, I'm going to strongly agree with that.
I had.
I had less fun playing it this time.
I feel like much of my fun was like.
I remember when I was surprised by that the last time I played.
Yeah, I think like the the surprise bit is the draw here.
1:19:51
And when people say don't look up anything about it, like they're they're telling you that the surprise is the draw.
I will say that like I wasn't entirely sure if Act One could stand on its own.
As like a stand alone experience like so you beat the game and then you're you're able to unlock Casey's mod and Casey is one of the creepypasta narrative people who was like working on the game.
1:20:19
The person who was killed in the fire.
Yes, And so there's like, you know, this, this haunted aberration of Casey persisting through the game.
And so Casey's mod is like, what?
What if act one and like a like a very basic ascension system?
1:20:39
Tied to it, no talking cards, no metamod is basically like what if this game was the game that you would thought it was when you first.
Started it up and I, I have to say like I, I think it could stand alone on just its own 2 feet by itself and be really, really good.
1:21:00
And like if if it was just that, I think it would be like a solid like 8.5 or 9 out of 10.
Easy.
Wow, I I feel like that is that is.
Generous, like the well, the reason why is because like I think we were kind of alluding to earlier that like act 1, you know, it's, I mean, we're comparing it to the goat slay the Spire, which is nothing but synergy building.
1:21:23
I think like Casey's mod really demonstrates that there is like a level of synergy building that you can do in the game and there's more, there's like there's more cards to do it with.
So it's like it's a more kind of fleshed out and.
There's more sort of event spots that you can hit, yeah.
1:21:39
And there's.
You can.
You can make many.
You can do much more broken things in Casey's mod, like you can keep laying symbols onto 1 card.
Yeah.
So and so I think that like as just a, a contained experience in and of itself, it it works really well.
1:21:59
And I think if that was just the game, it would be great.
There are, it's worth pointing out, fan mods have taken content from the other parts of the game and made a Gramora stand alone mod that I was like, OK, I have to play this for evaluation purposes.
It's exactly like what you would expect like a Gramora's segment of Act 3 to be if you also had like, like the audio design in this game is amazing.
1:22:25
And like this, like it's very like well tuned and very like elegant for what it is.
I don't know what's going on with this Gamora mod, but like it sounded like a shotgun was shooting nails at a chalkboard for me.
Where like some of these like, cuz you know, you, you go up against like the, the trapper, the traitor, the angler bosses and they all have like, kind of like different like voice lines to them and stuff.
1:22:50
And then for Gamora's mod, the boss that I fought, just it sounded awful.
Like I don't know what was happening, but but it was a a very displeasing experience for me.
But it's really popular.
1:23:05
Like it has like 87,000 downloads on on the inscription mod manager site.
And then there's a.
Stand like, I think that this is a game that due to its design kind of makes you want to like delve into some of the ideas of mods because like this game essentially just gives you like potential mods.
1:23:25
At the end of it.
There's like, here's four other things this game could be.
And so like, it is curious to like explore more of that, Yeah.
I think I like, after I had played like another, I don't know, 5 or 6 hours of Casey's mod and then going into Gramora's mod, I'm like, you know what?
1:23:41
I think I'm, I think I've got my fill for inscription for, for the year.
And I would say that like, yeah, like playing it through the first time.
I think I kind of shared Andrew's sentiment of like feeling grindy, feeling like, I don't know, is this worth it for me?
Coming back the second time, I thought, I thought it was much better.
1:24:00
What rank might you give it?
Whatever.
Is it that time?
I'm just will is will is wanting to move it along.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, we could jump into rankings.
For me, inscription ranks pretty highly.
I couldn't rank it higher than Slay the Spire because I feel like that would be Sackler Ridge, Sack sack sack.
1:24:21
Never.
That word is.
It would be absolutely incorrect.
It would be bad, but so I'm going to put it just behind Slay the Spire at 9.2.
I think this game like yeah, it's it's maybe not a like a roguelike in the strictest sense from end to end.
1:24:38
It it, it can't be because of how it's narrative structure is built.
But I think even if you just surgically cut out the part that is roguelike and just took that out, it would still be like really well designed and like really good aesthetic and well balanced and like interesting and different.
1:24:57
And like, for whatever reason, like I just I like got into the the systems for that much better than I did the first time that I tried playing Sleigh the Spire.
Obviously, like slayers fire is clearly better as like a real rogue like deck builder game.
1:25:12
But I think inscription holds up.
And I think like all of the the wackiness with its fourth wall breaking extra stuff on top of that, just like that's that's what would push it from like an 8.5 normally if it was just act one to like a 9.2 for for this particular rating purposes, because it's just it's so bananas.
1:25:34
There's it's just like there's there's a lot to it.
And the I remember the first time that I played it at hitting that Great Wall of Grizzlies and just being like, I don't know about this and really having a pretty UN unpleasurable experience, But I feel like the more like it's it's kind of like a fine one.
1:25:55
We're just kind of sipping at it a little bit at a time.
And again, this is where we kind of pinned Andrew in a corner and gave him an A homework assignment to do, which is everyone's favorite thing.
But like, taking your time with it and then revisiting it later after you've had time to kind of like, think about it for a little while and then forget it and then come back to it and be like, Oh yeah, I think this thing is supposed to happen.
1:26:16
Oh, yeah.
And you can kind of cruise through it a little faster.
Yeah.
I think this game is great. 9.2 What else am I looking through in my Google notes here?
The only I guess the only complaint that I have is yeah, the casting for the game funa hit woman, but that's it really.
1:26:34
I think like everything else is so on point with its wackiness.
If if that's like the only like major criticism I have then I think it's a pretty solid ass game.
Well, allow me to be sacrilegious here with my review.
Of sacrilegious on the sacrilege.
1:26:53
I'm standing on that sacrilege and I'm ready to take a flying leap.
So to be clear, you know, I have not played a lot of deck builders.
They are not my favored genre.
1:27:09
So it's obvious that, you know, this game would not be my favorite game, would not rank super high.
I've been quoted as saying I spent I spent a lot of my life being very worried about spoilers, whether it be TV spoilers or video game spoilers, book spoilers, etcetera, etcetera.
1:27:30
And in that that that is that is a bygone age.
I now sort of live by more of a creed of, you know, feel free to talk about the media you like to me.
And, you know, if you tell me about a spoiler, I generally believe that if a piece of media cannot survive being spoiled, then it's not that great in my in my estimation, Like good shows are still good, even if I know that certain like intense, you know, twists are are are coming.
1:28:02
And it it kind of feels to me like inscription leans a little too heavily on on on the that that surprise factor on those on those not being spoiler on going in without knowing anything.
However, it is, you know, heartening to hear that y'all did have enjoyable replays.
1:28:22
That's great.
I guess what, what, what is my big issue with this game?
I would have far preferred it.
In fact, one had been a little bit longer if I found the escape room cabin stuff very intriguing, if there'd been a little bit more of that, and if Acts 2 and three had been like 15 minutes each.
1:28:39
Like, just like gameplay for the sake of story, like let's go.
Let's go basically like the the the end, but just like I'm more flushed out that.
Indeed, that that's for me, an FBS meathead who doesn't want to learn new mechanics and doesn't want to have to understand how cards work.
1:28:57
So they have two sides.
What?
And so for me, this is coming in at #18 in my stack rating ranking 5.635.
And the number is so specific because I wanted to make sure that it was just behind dot age and just ahead of Wildermuth.
1:29:19
Yeah, that's, I'm going to throw it to Will.
Oh, I mean to Colin.
I'm going to give it an 8 and I have exactly the opposite of experience as Scott I.
1:29:36
I would give it a nine for the first playthrough and A7 for the second playthrough.
I found it much more enjoyable the first playthrough without the surprise.
I thought the first then.
You should give it a nine, right, because you're not.
I mean the doing it again was just for the podcast, so like.
1:29:53
But it now, now my view of the whole game is tainted.
No, literally it's like, oh, you know it.
I mean, I think that's fair.
One of the selling points of roguelikes is like, the ability to replay them and like the enjoyment that you get on, you know, following playthroughs.
1:30:09
I have played games a second time through before and been like oh that was fun, I remember why it was fun and this felt like the first act is still very fun.
First act for sure the strongest.
Even even knowing most of the spoiler stuff, I still think it has a really good sense of like, ambiance and like, the music for like the final couple battles is really good.
1:30:31
It really builds into the like, you're in this weird creepy cabin and if you lose, he might like eat your eyeballs or something.
And then like the second and third actor, just kind of a grind.
And I remember being like so intrigued by like where the game was going in the first playthrough that like, you know, I'm just like, all right, cool.
1:30:55
I'm crying.
I'm, I'm grinding through, I'm getting through stuff.
Like I'm learning new things.
Like I'm so just, I'm ready to know where this is going.
And the second time through, after knowing where it's going, you're like, yeah, this is really mostly just a grind.
Like there were a couple times, but like in the very, very beginning of Act 2, when you aren't very good, you lose a couple times.
1:31:12
That feels like not very interesting.
And then by the end of Act three, I was just like, like, how fast can I play through the cards?
Like getting annoyed at having to like look up and down because it means I was couldn't play cards as fast and just being like, all right, I'm ready to be.
I'm ready to get to the cutscenes at the end.
1:31:29
And.
It was over.
I I will go next just because I, I think Colin and I had very similar experiences.
Yeah, I think.
So yeah, what are your rankings so far, Your very official rankings that can't be changed at all, ever?
1:31:45
That's fine.
I, I, I think, yeah, I, I mean, my first thing.
Yeah, go ahead.
Sorry.
Well, yeah, so.
So your number you've been on a lot of we only bring you in for the good shows.
Your number one is Enter the Dungeon, followed by Dead Cells, then Into the Breach, FTL and then Vampire Survivors.
1:32:02
So where?
Where would this kind of stack up?
Again, I mean, again, my, my thesis statement for is I don't think this is a roguelike game like I I think straight up like, but so I would really play it a different reason than all of those other games.
1:32:19
But I'll put it at #4 between behind End of the Breach, but ahead of FTL because I mean, I really like this game.
And like I said, I think this game really caters to my interest as someone who's been into like trading card games for a long time.
1:32:36
And I think a lot of the joys of this game come from like building on preconceived ideas about trading card games and about roguelikes and stuff.
And so I think this game is is cool and memorable, but I think it it scratches a different itch than most of the reasons that I might play a roguelike game.
1:32:59
And I think I think Scott is being pretty generous with the mechanics.
Like I played Casey's mod a couple times and like just kind of felt like I randomly died to big armies of Flyers that I sort of had no way to deal with.
1:33:16
So it felt it just felt sort of more random than something like slave a Spire where I felt like I had a little more control over my own strategy.
But like from a pure a pure mood, it this game is is very much worth playing through once if you're someone who is interested in sort of just is just interested in video games and like weird games, which is always something I've had a soft spot for.
1:33:47
I guess I'm well.
Cool.
Well, yeah, I'm going to give it a nine and I'm, I gave it a nine before.
I'm going to give it a nine again because I don't, unlike Colin, I have some consistency.
I'm not going to go and rate, I'm not going to go and play Pokémon Red right now and say this is a shit game by today's standards. 3 out of 10 no.
1:34:06
Just be like.
That was his game for its time.
And like when I was playing it, it was the 10 out of tennis game that ever could be possibly in existence.
But anyways, so I guess the closing remark about this game is that yeah, you, you played play this fire.
You're like, Oh my God, deck building games are great.
1:34:22
Then you see Steam has this other deck building game.
It's called inscription.
You're like, OK, great.
And then you start playing it and then it gets wild and wacky like we've all talked about.
And that's really, I think it's a, it's a redefine.
It's it's, it's like of all the like sort of games that fall into the, the this kind of category of deck building.
1:34:39
I won't say roguelike, but deck building like it is its own special thing that I don't think anyone, as far as I know, has been able to replicate in any way in an interesting way.
And I think This is why it's winning awards.
It's just like the same of what the fuck is happening in this game and like, you know why there's live action people.
1:34:56
It's just like it just was full of novelty and surprise.
And that's like one of the core things.
It took a ton of development.
I think I was at the very end, I was not surprised to see the cast of like the creators and everything just like keep scrolling down.
Like I knew this was not a solo dev effort just based on like the complexity of the like the 3D animations and all the stuff going into it.
1:35:16
So lots of content in there and really great for a a playthrough for sure and nothing else really is quite the same.
Yeah.
So yeah, I think transitioning to our segment on similar games is really hard for this one because.
1:35:36
What other thing else is like it?
Just like Will said.
Exactly which is a good.
I'm going to throw some games out there.
They're not roguelikes.
That is like Stanley Parabelle.
Gary's Mod.
Coney Island is act.
Coney Island is a lot like this game.
Is it super liminal is actually a a recent game that is like you are, you're messing with like the size of objects and you like their perspective changes based off of how like you move around.
1:36:03
So it's got a, it's got a weird like play on video game stuff.
As well.
Is that a Simpsons reference?
Super liminal because I remember that that scene with the Yvonne Etniage right joining the it's.
Subliminal it's.
Subliminal versus super liminal.
1:36:20
It's not like below the surface, it's explicitly above the surface.
Another another game that if you, you know, don't mind the genre, that kind of scratches the same sort of meta itch is Doki Doki Literature Club, which is kind of an arrangement of this sort of thing in like sort of the what's the one?
1:36:41
What's the one that's like the math or spelling game that gets real weird is that?
Math Black Oh Frog fractions.
Frog Fractions.
Yeah.
Frog Fractions is like super insane.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that is that is roguelike at some point.
So yeah.
But the point is it's not a roguelike.
1:36:57
And so that's why we're listing all these other games that are roguelikes.
Well, so for games.
So this was my best attempt at a list of games that are like kind of kind of, well that are roguelikes, but still kind of hit that same vibe as Inscription.
We talked about Casey's mod as as its own kind of standalone experience.
1:37:16
The Gamora and Magnificus mods if you are desperate for more Inscription hype gameplay are are I guess worth looking into just for that aspect.
There's a a Japanese manga roguelike like like one bit colored roguelike game called World of horror which is very like eldritch God.
1:37:40
How would you even describe it's again like all these games are kind of like indescribably weird, but hit that kind of horror note very well for Spooktember coming into Spooktober here.
One game that actually like feels very mechanically similar to inscription is a game that's come out recently called Buckshot Roulette that I don't know if anyone else has played, but it's like, what if you were playing Russian roulette with a shotgun and kind of inscription?
1:38:05
These sort of mechanics question mark and.
And similar atmosphere as well.
Like, you know, first person.
You're sitting at a creepy table.
Low, low lit spookiness.
Another game that is very it's it's rogue but also similarly narrative driven and unsure about replayability but hard on the narrative aspect is brutal Orchestra where you are in purgatory waiting for the guy who killed you to die so you can kill him.
1:38:35
There is a monster, I guess a monster management game called Lobotomy Corporation.
You have a look that.
Is a good that is a good title of a game.
Another kind of very eldritchy kind of deal.
You have a another like Asian inspired or like an Asian developer inspired by Lovecraftian horror themes.
1:38:59
Like it's like inscription vibe meets Luckbee, a landlord with God.
I don't know how I've said this before.
I don't know how to pronounce this.
Fung Tang simulator, FHTAGN simulator, you're a demon you're sacrificing humans and monsters to to raise Cthulhu.
1:39:16
Who doesn't like that?
Ring of Pain, another kind of horror rogue game that is like a it's like a card based dungeon crawler, which is very interesting.
I'm going to I'm going to lump Darkest Dungeon in here too, just for horror theme.
1:39:33
And yeah, maybe, maybe I'll call it there because we're running a little long.
The Tooth.
Yeah, similar games.
Long in the teeth?
Hey that was my biggest problem.
I wasn't long in the teeth for most of my playthrough.
Get my apply.
That's what we put on the scale, OK.
Are.
1:39:49
We playing next?
Yeah, well, how can they reach us?
Yeah, so you know, right in with all the stories you have at the dentist where they're pulling out your teeth and putting them on on the scales to to strangle you with grogpodzone@gmail.com Mastodon, Grogpod at game dev dot plays and Grogpod dot zone for the website Woody.
1:40:07
You're, you're on here to to talk about cool stuff that you're doing.
This is This is your 5 minute sequence.
All right, I seed my time.
I'm not doing any cool stuff except for playing inscription a second time.
OK, that was the cool thing that I did.
So yeah, our next episode.
1:40:24
That's nice of you to do that.
Thanks for joining us.
Yeah, yeah.
Thank always have an open seat here for for whatever the our next episode is a listener requested episode.
This has been one that people have been kicking down our door for a while to talk about.
And so we are turning turning the clock back to 1995 and we're booting up our now.
1:40:48
What do you always called a SNES?
I've always called it an SNES.
And we are booting up Mystery Dungeon Sheeran the Wanderer, which I guess I said I should explain, is the Japanese only release was for the Super Nintendo or Famicom.
1:41:06
We're probably going to play the Nintendo DS version because that way we don't have to worry about weird ROM translation hacks.
Yeah, so but you know, it's, it's, it's the remaster from the 1995 version.
But anyway, yeah, Mystery Dungeon Sheer and the Wanderer a a Japanese feudal Japan roguelike game, one of the first to really feature graphics.
1:41:35
So so be on my own developments.
Yeah, this is this is what people from clambering for.
So thanks Woody again for for dropping in as our surprise quote UN quote secret guest for act three of the podcast here.
But but playing us out from this episode is some tunes to to really under score the fact that a journey of 1000 sacrificed squirrels begins with the single strum of the banjo.
1:43:05
The the.
