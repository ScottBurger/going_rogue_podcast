[Music] h hello everyone and happy grogs giving where each episode we here on this uh podcast of Rog light games we sit down we take time to reflect and somberly give thanks as we shoot out of a sewage pipe into a dungeon and reanimate ourselves to talk about a video game uh then we compare said video game to and we look at its stats and we we compare it against all the rest of the the games that we've already ranked we decided if we want to keep it or recycle it for that precious shopkeeper gold uh I am your writhing massive goo host of saided podcast SC burger and imprisoned with me on this island of malaise are my co-hosts that's right it's me Andrew Harshman uh and I am of course the very real and very evil elevator that is rocketing downward uh which breaks your neck your non-existent neck uh and you accidentally murder yourself very very fun mechanic there and I'm calling a call out to another video game that has been transported into this game to do massive damage and joining us as special guest is hello this is Woody saskowski hidden final guest boss you can only you can only get me as a guest on your pod if you play with five cell difficulty so congratulations guys unlocked the true ending of the podcast this is when when you go to the fandom page for this site there's a bunch of like or like the Reddit there's a bunch of like people post pictures of the final boss and they're like you better put a spoiler tag on that thing what a deal well I'm glad that we are are filtering out that spoiler tag and having you yeah the spoiler is that I am the final boss and they're like the hell is this guy why is he the final boss in this game that we've never seen some generic thin balding white guy there you go yes it was the Mia will has transformed into Woody yeah we so like I don't know if this is pulling back the crowd Dynamics too much but was he like literally like I don't want to talk about this game so I'm not going to be on the Will's reaction was uh he opened up the game played it for maybe five minutes and was like I can't do this I don't know like I think I think he has such an allergic reaction to games that aren't turn-based that but he liked Hades a lot like no I think he hates Platformers okay I think he just categorically hates Platformers and also since we knew you were going to have we were having you as a guest it was like H five's a crowd uh it doesn't feel quite so bad skipping out no no that that is fair it is just surprising because it's like I kind of I I don't know if we said you said it we're talking about dead cells um yeah oh wait did we say it I don't know we didn't because I have my I have my little Zinger line here in the Google dog rewind it rewind it put the spoiler tag over what I just said that out talking about beep and now you say what you have to say okay excellent yes we'll be we'll edit all this out in post I like the way I come and guest on your podcast I'm like now you talk Scott that's why people tune in is to hear me get interrupted all the time so gather around that is the host job on all podcasts is to be the person who gets consistently interrupted I I am the Conan O'Brien and you are the the guy on the couch whose name I'm spacing on who com only I a pod the guy what Andy uh oh Andy yeah yeah yeah yeah Andy RoR yes max7 not not watching at home um Scott did a very nice little Conan O'Brien dance there so yes yeah we we'll gather around the grogs giving table everyone grab a seat and grab a drumstick and heal that 50% health for our surprise title game of today is dead cells shock I always think it's weird like with podcasts of they they always take a little bit to the to the conversation of like who is the guest and what are we actually talking about even though it says both of those things in the title of the episode that's true I I feel like there needs to be a function in like your podcast catcher where you can just like spoiler alert on title of episode so you don't know what game they're talking about or who the guest is until it actually starts I mean I also could just say dead cells uh with Mr X and then people like oh find out who Mr X is and then he comes bursting through their walls and like uppercuts them Resident Evil uh dead cells anyway different game uh this is our this is a 2018 release released a August 6th 2018 this is our only 2018 game that we played thus far in our catalog spanning from 2011 to this year uh we somehow spaced on a game from 2018 but I think we landed on a slam dunk of one uh dead cells is one of those games that you can literally find anywhere PC Playstation Xbox switch and I literally mean anywhere because it's on IOS and Android uh if you have the quick enough thumbs to play it I think you even get it for free on your phone if you have a Netflix account like like Netflix they're making a show based on dead cells and so they're like oh let's give a copy of dead cells to all our subscribers so how wait how do you play dead cells on your phone you know guys I'm just going to say I think that this is what separates us from the younger generation like every every generation has a thing where they're like how do you do this and I think it might be playing dead cells on your phone specifically the great cultural divide yeah I think there's something about Hades coming to to mobile phones at some point soon also and I remember reading similar like old man criticism of like how can you young youngans play it on your phone and then someone was commenting of like well you haven't seen my niece or nephew like like do all like the pinch zooming action and like pubg is supposedly like way bigger on mobile than it is on on PC but I always said I'd be cool old guy who didn't say but I found I guess I found my issue like it no it can't possibly be as good on a phone as it is on my giant widescreen monitor next to my 20 pound Tower PC got to have that monolith of a PC well with something like pubg it's like well you know a big part of the world uh you know gaming phones are a bigger deal CU easier more accessible cheaper to like get a hold of a gaming phone than it is to get a hold of PC so understand that with like a shooter it's it's a whole thing and uh depending on you know where you are on the globe but with like dead cells I mean Hades you don't need that much computing power to run it anyway but that's neat uh good on those folks maybe maybe that's the problem will wasn't playing this game on a phone that would have obviously I'm sure that's what he would have loved improved his experience yeah I mean this game came out in 2018 and I think that the company I mean you'll probably go into this back story a little bit but I think that the company that made this uh motion twin I think it's called has essentially ridden this game like and just sort of continually release content for it since it's come out and I think they're on like expansion number five or six or something and I think yeah new stuff came out like this year yeah and like new new cool stuff yeah yeah uh motion twin based out in Bordeaux France think we've had a few other uh French developed games on this uh on the show neat fact about them they were founded as like an anarchic Co-op so that like everyone in like their small Game Dev company was got the exact same salary uh totally flat corporate structure uh and it worked out good for them apparently they also spun off like a new uh company from that called evil empire which is like 50 plus people and that has your kind of standard CEO corporate hellscape hierarchy no what happened they were living living the dream if they'd kept that uh you know Anarchist structure maybe I would have bumped up the ranking a bit that's interesting I did not know that so the orig sorry the original development team was how many people approximately I think it it's somewhere around like 10 or 12 people so pretty small uh but you know that it's about what you would I think expect from like Indie Indie title games that have like a decent amount of developer Firepower behind it that aren't like solo Dev Boutique like weirdo games that you find in weird corners of itch and um it's I feel like this game like I I can't remember I think that this game was in Early Access for like a super duper long time um I think I remember actually like mooching it off of uh Scott's family sharing for like 20 hours um before I the game actually was officially like out of beta and I'm like no okay I guess I will actually buy it now um but this is like for a game that is you know not like an online multiplayer game this has had sort of a devoted fan base to it all the way since before it was even officially released um and I think it goes to show just how much care like the um development team puts into this game yeah First Impressions I mean I I played this at Pax 2017 in the Indie Indie Dev like Mega Booth they had a a booth for it it was strolling around like oh yeah let's check out these indie games dead cells you say uh sat down and surprisingly like not any lines for it I just like sat down the you know the person gave me the controller and I was playing like whoa this is this is interesting uh because like 2017 like that was kind of a long time ago uh and I could tell like right off the bat like this has got something special behind it um well I I think that like the the selling points of this game like sound a good pun there oh sorry they sound appealing but they don't actually make the game stand out in any way cuz like the keywords on this are like Rog like SE like dead cells like and like that's kind of what it's built on and it's like 2D platformer and there's a lot I think probably even in 2017 like everyone was kind of riding both the Rog likee and the dead cell or and the um not dead cells Dark Souls Dark Souls that's what I'm trying to say um the Dark Souls Souls Dark Cells yeah well even the tit even the title is just like almost instantly for forgettable like I've played this game so much that it sticks in my head by now but like I always had trouble recommending this game to people when I was first getting into it because they were like what's that game called and I'm like uh it's the uh you know it's it's the special the special group from Metal Gear Solid 2 with fat man uh Vamp and uh and Fortune you know dead cell praise the cell yeah well sounds better dead cell sounds better with like a cool accent you know um but so Scott there's there's a little addendum to that your Pack story um if you wouldn't mind telling us uh you know what a what a what a great first impression the game made uh when you go to one of these conventions and you're demoing a game of course there's like a little sign that'll tell you you know please limit your play to such and such amount of time but yeah your case sat down and yeah usually you're given like five to 10 minutes like play the game and then make way for the next person in the 10,000 person long line uh but I you know 10 minutes go past I look around there was like there's no one there and the you know I was just like okay I'm just going to keep playing I must have sat down and played it for like an hour or something and it was just like I think it was just the um like the the prisoners quarters level the very first one that you started in but it was just like everything about it felt so polished and fluid and seamless at the time even that I was like oh my God like they're just going to let me keep playing this okay and then I eventually like got up like I should probably check out some other but it was like such like an immediate draw like instantly that I just I knew that like when it came out fully like even on Early Access I was like yep day one gotta go get it well that's what I think is interesting about this game is usually like when I think about the stereotypes maybe that make up Indie gaming I think of things that are built upon like really strong interesting like innovative ideas but sometimes the actual execution or polish of that is lacking and I think that this game is like the total opposite of yeah it's 100% execution yeah it's like a lot of the mechanics and sort of um gameplay aspects of this are slightly derivative um but like it just feels so unbelievably good to play this game yeah like we've kind of jumped ahead of ourselves a little bit but uh coming back to our uh stats sheet intro before we get off too much uh this dead cells rolls into the number nine most popular rogl game on Steam with 38,8 2016 total reviews uh will was correct in skipping this one because number eight is slay the Spire with a whopping 100 more total reviews um but Woody you've come across a set of alchemical testing notes in a corner of a dank prison how do they describe this game in one sentence um 2D Dark Souls there you go only needed three words and two of them record for the gr I believe um and I I don't I guess I mean how accurate do you feel like that that is like I feel like I think I think thematically that makes sense but it almost feels a little on the nose that they released a a Castlevania like full conversion DLC cuz it feels like castle like Castle souls or dead Sania or something like that yeah I could see that so yeah I mean like and even I was just thinking about this when uh just playing it before we were recording like the door opening animation feels very Castlevania Symphony Sy you actually open doors in this game you don't just roll through them every single time I open exactly one door and it's the door to the beginning when you don't have a weapon and you have to open that first door it's always confusing I roll into it I'm like wait oh right I have to I can't just punch my way through it one of the

cruestv destroying any doors and like you just have and like immediately whenever I go there I have to be like wait stop press X to open door and just like methodically go through because I'm just so used to like rolling and crashing through every door you'd think it would get boring but it doesn't yeah yeah I I do want to push back though against saying it's just 2D uh Dark Souls because I I think that there I haven't played that much dark souls in general but I think there is a pretty fundamental difference between them um because if you die in this game you start over and you start at the beginning of of the Run versus Dark Souls it's like so much of it is well I'm gonna just fight this same boss like 16 times in a row until I figure out how to like memorize all of its move sets but that is that is true in this as well it's just the actual gap between time of when you get from the start back to the boss is going to ends up being a fundamental difference because by the time you get back to it you're doing a different build you're it's been 40 minutes or aesthetically aesthetically it's like dark souls in the sense that like there's there's um like mutated well like Monsters and skeletons and all and like all these weird like creatures that you're running around and bashing and stuff um you're rolling constantly very dark souls and I think the aesthetic has a sort of fundamental vag and mystery to it in the sense that like you are sort of on this like mysterious island and world that doesn't have a very clear connection to like why you're here or what is going on or who like who you were before everything started yeah exactly and that that's actually kind of the story of this game is like the the the mood and Aesthetics like take a long time to actually develop and like when you just play through on sort of one difficulty none of that stuff gets revealed and you have to play through it like each time you beat it you unlock a new difficulty level and by the time you get to like the final difficulty and beat spoiler boss which is me right um You you're sort of the true nature of uh is somewhat revealed but again similar to like the ending of Elden ring it's like okay like that was kind of revealed but I still don't really know what's going on right that's very intriguing to me as someone who has not beat the game on any difficulty yeah same it's uh nice to hear that like oh there's more to come back and play because I've been playing some games recently where it's like yo you know I enjoyed the gameplay I'd like to keep playing it but there's no motivation for me to do it so like when dev's you know add extra features extra extra stuff extra difficulty um you know options and whatnot it's that's great that's awesome and this game like really shows the fact that it's they've been working on content for it for like five six years because the amount of content that they have put into this game is just so crazy like you know it takes a while to beat the game the first time um and to like continually unlock stuff but as you go through in that very first like sort of lobby area of the game there's like one of those view Masters that you can put in a coin and it shows you all of these empty canisters and like every single one of those canisters of which there's a couple hundred um all have a unique weapon or power that you unlock and then even when you start playing on the higher difficulties and have unlocked most of those there's still like tons of costumes and stuff to unlock so they give you enough to justify keeping playing and like that to me is the heart of this game is like they started like the development process of this like just makes sense to me of like this is how I imagine it was I don't know but like they started with such like a clean fundamental of like we're going to make this game feel super good and super satisfying to play and once we have that Baseline down of like the jumping and the running and the parrying and the fighting all that feels great we're just going to keep adding stuff on top of that to give you more and more to unlock yeah I mean I I think that like that and that tracks with my like initial impression of it at the get-go too was like this it just feels so smooth and solid to play yeah like when that core fundamental is like so well polished you can add more stuff on top of that and it's you know just extra good sprinkles and things on top of there but um even just like if if like the um if like the gameplay was mediocre there's so much other stuff around it that is interesting from a development perspective that is that like we really haven't seen thus far like we haven't really seen the only other like platformer game that we that we rated reasonably well was risk of rain and that one like didn't really have this kind of like exploration Metroid Vania bit to it where like you run around and like you get some permanent upgrades that allow you different traversal techniques so like climbing walls or like oh there's like a thing here that I can teleport to a different part of the map or I think that risk of rain is a game that has way more mechanics in it like this is kind of what I realized about dead cells is for all the content in it it doesn't really have that many mechanics like there's not like in Risk of Rain you can like stack a bunch of items to get like a crit or aack speed build the way you would in like a Diablo or something like dead cells doesn't really have like the RPG elements are very light and like you sort of just get whatever the bet whatever weapon is handed to you and you're like I guess I'm using this Swift sword and like that's always going to be the same like per run like the Swift sword is always going to be the same if you get it in a different run um whereas something like risk of rain it's like I am very much shooting for like this kind of specific build that I'm working I I just think that that's a game where you really have to understand a lot more about it whereas this um dead cells like most of your success comes just from like memorizing enemy patterns your character fights yeah I think actually that that's that's where I would agree on that like so much of this game is rolling around and like understanding how the things work and you can basically beat them the same way you you like slightly adjust how you're playing based off of um like oh I have this melee weapon versus this other one it's like okay it means I'm going to like pop up and jump on them instead of like face tanking them for a bit but um I so I I know that I'm gonna end up comparing this game a lot to um Hollow Knight because that is like my favorite platformer and I think that they do a lot of things similar and a lot of things very different um but the thing that I think they do similar that I really like which is why I like both of them is they feel super like crisp uh in that in both games when you play them it feels so responsive when you roll around and like the inputs are really tight and it just when you get in that good Flow State of just like running around and like hopping around and dodging and everything and that's like it's such a good feeling um and it is hard to build that into a platformer in a lot of ways like I think that's where this this when we talked about earlier like this game is execution it doesn't do anything any one thing particularly nov but it's everything it does is executed super well and I think that's something something like Hollow night is basically just pure execution and then this just adds uh all of the randomness of like hello you can literally play with the weapon from Hollow KN or you can play with other weapons from other game you can like oh you want want to play Castlevania like well here's alucard's uh stuff so you can play with that too um which I I found delightful when the first time that the the hollow night nail was unlocked I'm like oh I like this game and I also like this other game and now I play both of them at the same time and Colin you're talking about like the the game play Flow and oo How Sweet It Is like once you get rolling the game rewards you with meta currency meta progression currency for for Speed playing quickly but also for getting like a chain of kills without taking damage and that there's a mechanic in which you get like speed boosts and you're seeing you're seeing all these awesome animations going on there's a special Sprint animation and when you're zipping around bashing enemies and going fast and and feeling like proficient and good at the game it like just really clicks and is really awesome it's very imp impressive now when you screw that up by accidentally doing like a a speed boost jump down right onto some spikes oh yeah feels that's pretty brutal yeah but you know when it's feeling good or oh man this game what what do you guys think about the cursed chests in this game like um the the there's so yeah oh man I I I don't know I've never really decided how I feel about this this is like you you can unlock um along your quest you'll get to curse chest which you can unlock and will give you a pretty good item and like a stat upgrade but then you die in one hit until you kill 10 10 enemies and I will be having very good runs and I'll be like I should probably get that cursed chest there might be something great in it and then I start to get all like you just get nervous and you start playing off your game super slow yeah and then you do the you lose that flow State and you jump down into some spikes and you die for a stupid reason you're like I didn't even need that stat upgrade and that like poison water and you're just like oh the stupidest way of dying one tick of damage is all it takes yeah I know so like I I know that's kind of on me because I could just make the choice not to take the cursed chest but I'm so greedy yeah one of the pillars of fun as uh as described by um our absent host will uh is making those decisions and that is game right that's a great example he never opened a cursed JZ he didn't make it that far I mean I I feel like dead cells has a very um like uh not subversive but like not obvious form of like really hard decision making that you have to do as you're playing where like I I watched a few like high level speedruns of it and oh my God like they had there's like a a whole science to like the probability states of like the Dual scroll drop chanes chances and things and I'm just like you know this is the stuff that will would like lose his mind over but that I mean that becomes true when people get into high levels of any game as people start exploring that stuff I think it's more I think more of the Testament is that this game is good enough to justify people exploring those things because like when you think about games that people have dug so deeply in like super metroid or Mario 64 or something like you people explore all of these things that are so complicated and Smash Brothers Melee you're like well those were never really part of the game design to begin with it's just the game so much fun that people are like I'm going to learn everything about this game right there's like there's like the super deep end of the spectrum of tactical decision making but there's like a really like just under the surface of like runaround whack things decision making of like okay do I want to go on this path or this path or this path so in your typical run of this game you know you'll start you'll always start in the prisoners quarters that's the the area that you always start in you'll fight the same like low-level monsters and things um but you're off a choice like do you want to go into this biome or that biome and like depending on your style of play like what your what weapon you picked up what kind of Scrolls of kind of you know invisible hand guided you in this sort of play style Direction you could be like well maybe I don't want to go to uh stilt Village I mean who does uh or you know do I do I want to to risk it to go to this other level for like a higher drop chance if the enemies are in that area are going to have like this kind of style of attacking does that like how does that compare with the items that I've picked up thus far like do I expect that I'm going to be able to um build and synergize with the stuff that I've collected in this run in such a way that I'll be able to just like wipe people as I'm going through this level or am I going to get totally overwhelmed by going in this biome and then there's like uh like flying vampire bats that just quickly surround you and eat you in two seconds you're like well that was kind of expected because I didn't have the the way to deal with it and I picked up that cursed chest super greedily and I didn't have a way to fight them off from a distance yeah the cursed chest choice is definitely like heavily influenced by what weapons do you have do you have some traps that you can like fling out there and just like slowly pick off exactly 10 enemies and then go back to your normal play style or that kind of like the the furthest I like there was some I I I know I T told uh Scott and Andrew about like some some ways in at some point I got like twice as far as I'd got before it was like all this perfect synergies and like throwing out uh traps and stuff and like your play style can be pretty heavily influenced by what you ended up getting and what you like traps and uh your your skill items can very heavily influence your play style um how aggressive you are in it uh so the thing that is yeah I mean to piggyback on that I want I want to talk talk about sort of the RPG stat mechanics of this game because that's the thing that I maybe have the biggest issue with but is also the thing that sort of is the most unique about this game um because like what Colin was saying is the items that you get sort of dictate your play style basic there are three colors of stats um red is your sort of melee brutality um that has a lot of swords and sort of like life steel or um Elemental mechanics um blue is tactics which has traps and lots of bows and more range weapons and then green is um survival which like has a lot of like Parry and attack and then get an attack bonus back things like that um but certain weapons only have certain colors associated with them and like they only scale with those colors so like if you get sort of this the the bleeding sword um but you're you only that will only increase in damage if you're building up your red brutality stats and the thing that so that always I feel a little weird about because if you decide the way you build up stats the best is because it's you know the best offense is a good offense in this game the best defense is a good offense kill them quickly kill them first and you don't have to worry about defense and the way to do that is to just only take the same color whenever you can um because because it's exponentially scaling and it's like yeah ex the plus 15% adds on to the previous plus 15% which not the case whatever scroll you essentially decide to get first is like all right I am committed to going this color for the rest of the game which severely limits your options of build and I always kind of wish that'd be like okay I'd like to build green so I have access to some of these mutations and different abilities but then it means most bows that I can't that I find I don't get to use and that's balanced a little bit by having colorless or legendary items which scale with any sort of um which scale with whatever your highest color is but it's just something that has always been a little bit of a sticking point for me but I think like that is part of this game is I think that this game sacrifices a little bit of build customization and flexibility to be like super fastpaced and clear because like once you know that you're like I'm just picking red every time it takes you a split second to like get one of those Scrolls and just select red you don't have to like think about what stat do I want to build up you you come across a random purple weapon you're like well this is not red so therefore it's dead to me yes exactly better dead than red yeah I think like the there's like a weird push pull for um like being able to to go into a run of a rogue Style game with like a specific play style in mind versus the game kind of dictating to you no actually this is the play style that you're going to to deal with like how are you going to react to it and I think that like Risk of Rain does this in sort of two different ways where like one is um the standard way when you first pick it up is like all the items are random and like you don't really have a choice as to what item that you get sometimes there's like a a pick three or pick one out of the three selection but um there is there is like a special artifact that you can unlock in that it's like oh well now you can actually pick what you want and like then it becomes very much like a build order game and Hades is like a different style of that where it's like okay well maybe like I'll pick this weapon to start with and that will sort of guide my play style and like the other stuff around it will augment that play style but dead cells is also very different in the sense of like you know it's more on kind of like the pick three or pick one out of three because there's so many uh shopkeepers in this game right yeah you have to make you basically make your decision like within the first because the harder difficult you play the more and more important it is to just stick with one color because you need all that all the damage you can get and so you basically make the decision of the play style that you're going to do at before you even start your run and like Scott said there's going to be plenty of shopkeepers that will give you weapons of the color that you yeah no matter how dank and uh remote in a cemetery you find yourself there's always going to be a fun little shopkeeper with their neat little Tunes hiding out down there to give you some some Wares to buy but I think like it's almost for me anyway uh dictated by what legendary items you get because the last couple runs that I did I just beat my I just finally crossed the zerob BC win threshold a couple hours before I hit that record button uh and like I got real close last night again with legendary items because as you're running through the game you'll eventually come across some uh like grow glowing yellow orbs that are attached to some enemies nearby you kill them and then oh you can unlock this this item that's like you know it has an item you a name and then like a level and then a dash L on it for legendary the a a weird kind of like scaling point system of like oh you know you it may be like a level three Cleaver but it's a dash L and it has all these other affixes to it that make it crazy good it's it's very it's very Diablo um in terms of like the legendary items all have like a sort of AIX that is unique to that legendary weapon and so like all legendary scissors you get have the same bonus AFF effect but it's only on Legend yeah yeah and I felt like the the times previous where I was like okay I'm I'm going to try to build around some items that I got and uh I foolishly stuck to to some that were like kind of lowish level like level four and five for like the final boss didn't do so hot yeah I have like an ice bow three-h L here I was like what was I thinking I suppose a trap against bosses it doesn't do anything but I had this really excellent Synergy with like a root grenade that would like root enemies and this legendary Cleaver skill that would like throw these Buzz saws out and do like 75% more damage to rooted enemies so Bam Bam like synergized like that and it was just melting dudes and I beat the uh the final hand of the king boss in like three seconds and I was like okay there you go um but like finding I feel like that kind of element of like finding um you're right that like you have to sort of build in one color Direction but I don't think it necessarily like limits you specifically to like oh I got a play with this one item um cuz you can upgrade you can kind of upgrade the items as you go along a little bit but I think as as you um unlock permanent abilities like with shopkeeps to say like oh now I can roll the items in the shop until I get something that kind of fits my build a little better that'll help carry me a little further one of the things that's this game is a lot like enter the gungeon in the sense that it's also a game I've played like 200 hours of um but I think that they are kind of similar in the way that they both both had a lot of content released after I had already played through um sorry I'm getting an important phone call um it will be picked up okay um they both had a lot of content that was released after I had played through the early stages of the game and so it's like I didn't really get to I only experienced like I think they've gotten more generous with the legendary and the colorless items since the game was initially released and so I've only seen those though on the higher cell difficulties which is where I play because it's always been this weird thing of like dead cells has gone through so many times of releasing a new expansion that like totally changes the game and adds like a whole extra boss and tons of extra items and I'm like do I want to like erase my save and start start something new and lose all of that other content because it's always weird when you've unlocked like 80% of the game and then they like kind of move the goal post and be like oh here's new content too that already so it becomes confusing in terms of like what parts have been added after the fact like have you gotten the you you did not get the same new player experience that I got exactly exactly and I have I have gotten many legendary weapons and I have not yet beaten the final boss despite putting you know 18 hours in which is like a reasonable amount of time to have played a video game yeah you'll you'll do it Colin I got I will I I got pretty darn close last night I think uh oh there uh there are some accessibility options in here to make the game a little easier if you want I will say Scott when it comes to this game Scott Burger has been really singing us um it really roasted us pretty hard I was complaining in our our private Discord uh Communications about ah stilt town which is like this pirate themed uh you know dare I dare I you know compare it to Blight Town maybe is that what it's called from Dark Souls and I was complaining about oh these they got these enemies with got they're like these big pirate Blackbeard looking dudes with cannons and the cannon explodes into a billion different pieces of explosive and then there's these heat sinking like uh I don't know what you call them like uh these blood sucking like slugs that fly around anyway after my big long Jag uh Scott Burger who is a very nice fellow he's a gentleman and a scholar just responds with more like tilt town am I right hey and pretty good after that I was like okay well I I can't let STL town get me down I need to I need to get back I did have a really bad tilt pushing me to to to play harder my my my tilt Town moment very recently on this last run that I did was like all right I'm going to play very carefully I'm GNA like do the the no hit like 60 like kill 60 enemies to get like the extra extra benefits at the end of the level thing I'm like okay yeah I've got it got like really good flow going here I get to stilt town I'm like it's going to be no problem I got all these weapons here that are just going to melt dudes Cannonball guy comes right around the corner just blam right in the face I'm just like I had to pause the game and just go really okay tilt Town it is then isn't it tilt town is I mean the nice thing about this and Rog likes in general especially when you're like I don't know still at the beginning which is to say 18 hours in like there's still like a ton of stuff to unlock and like as long to me as long as I'm playing a Rog like and I feel like I'm getting better at the game and there is more stuff to unlock I don't care how often I die like I am happy to keep sort of doing run after run and I get initially frustrated but I mean full disclosure like I I I beat this game on five cells eventually which is the hardest difficulty but I turned on those accessibility options because one of the options is like respawn at the the you know the biome that you died and like it is hard to get to the last biome on full difficulty and then the boss there is like a three stage son of a [ __ ] um and so I'm like I don't want to play through this you know 40 minute run where I am you know not super likely to get back to the final boss and then just instantly die on him train the last boss before you yeah yeah well especially because by that point in the game like I was not unlocking new content so it just became beating my head against you know the same levels over and over and so like once I finally you know beat him with those accessibility options on i very very happy to set down this game I wasn't like oh I wish there was more content I could keep playing it definitely like reached the threshold where I'm like that got hard enough I'm happy that I put 200 hours into it and I'm also happy to be done yeah I think one of the the the the things in favor of this game one like the the true selling points is that you could play it through for 200 hours and have fun but I was also having fun like 10 minutes in already being like oh this is a good game I didn't buy it some years ago because I looked at I was like I don't know the graphic style doesn't look weird like great doesn't look like has anything crazy novel and I like just set it aside like I had heard about it for a while but like 10 15 minutes in I was like oh I'm gonna play this game a lot because it just feels good and you continue unlocking things and continuing to feel good for many hours later like many hours I'm going to continue playing this game after we're done with this podcast which isn't true of all of the games we reviewed hey that's that's an excellent Mark of quality I I uh yeah I think similarly definitely going to continue to play it um and I had a very similar experience like I was aware of dead cells for a very long time it was one of those games is there a term for this the game that you just keep in your steam wish list for years and you just ignore the sale every time there really should be a term for it you're right maybe it's a yeah I don't know a dead sale I don't know anyway so I yeah and eventually got so bad that I just removed it from my waist and and a similar experience like I I would glance at it and be like generic surely it's overrated surely uh you know I surely I know better having not ever actually sat down and tried to play the game um but uh that and maybe kind of divisive what what do uh what does everyone think of we were talking about Aesthetics earlier what do we think of the character design of our protagonist the dead cell M Mr dead cell yeah no I I I agree with Colin I think mediocre is a is a fair thing like like the way this game looks because it's for all like sort of the darkness that going on in the story like it's not murky the way like a dark souls is like it's very colorful and like kind of cartoony and friendly but like the actual protagonist and characters in this game I don't find very interesting at all right how would we describe it to someone who's never played it maybe a sort of a a steampunk ninja but instead of having a head there's just sort of floating moat of flame and not a cool mode of flame like O say like you know Ghost Rider or the headless horsemen but like this weird pixelated little thing and I was the first like couple hours not even couple hours I'd say the first several hours dare I say it six seven hours I spent looking for alternate skins I'm like surely there's got to be one with a head and I was playing as Santa Claus for a long time I was like this kind of works he has like a hat or something I don't know maybe I'm I'm begging on it too much but I'm glad to hear that I'm not totally off Bas people kind of agree that no I I think that that is the part of this game that I think is not bad but I think it's probably the weakest section of this game is this game wants to kind of Supply you with like lore and kind of make you care about the story here but like none of those aspects really stand out and when I think of like the two Rog likes that I've played the most which is dead cells and enter the gungeon like enter the gungeon to me has much more of like a sense of humor and like sort of world and lore and weapons that I find much more funny and charming and appealing and it's not like I yeah whereas dead cells I'm like yeah you're in a fantasy world full of like zombies and muck there's nothing in it that screams like this is this is funny or goofy or particularly Charming yeah that's why I found it puzzling that they opted for the uh like Final Fantasy 7 Cloud character trait of the main character just kind of shrugs at everything like I don't know it doesn't quite work in this situation a lot of the humor of it was just like ah reference look look it's a thing that you've heard of and I'm not totally sure how gungon is able to get away with it and maybe because it's just a shooting game and I like shooting games puns which are the highest form of humor well no but also like pardon me I meant with specifically with like references to other media and other material I guess it's because like that is one of the like Central conceits like right out of the gate it's like enter the gungeon you're going to be encountering guns from all over the place whatever and then where's dead dead cells I I almost call it Dead Space Great Name all it all Blends together yeah dead cells is like it does it feels out of place every time I encounter a reference to another indie game of which there are so many why why is there The Hotline Miami baseball bat and why is it the best weapon in the game there's a whole like room devoted to yeah the like I enjoy playing with the weapons and I it's like it's fun that they're there but it it it definitely rides real close to that line of like H okay fine references fine like I it's not it's not making it better or worse it's just adding variety and luckily for them it's a really good game to it feels good to play so having more variety makes it also still feel good to play with that variety but like if this game was slightly worse I think it would go downhill very quickly it just be like oh it's both generic and has no sense of soul in some ways like it feels like it's just trying to borrow the soul of a lot of other games yeah for its Aesthetics and sense of humor and stuff um which is not its strong point um but it's also fun that like like they could have just taken the the weapon from Hollow Knight or the weapon from hyper light Drifter and like made it the same like mechanics and be like oh this is obviously a hollow night ripoff but it's like instead they're like oh no it's just obviously a hollow ripoff like we're not going to we're not going to like pretend that it's not okay well in some ways I respect that like yeah this is just literally the hollow night weapon we're not g to pretend it's not and I don't have too much of an issue with that I guess like the whole like Fanfare of like in order to get the Hotline Miami bat it's like you have to go into a Hotline Miami room that is like bedazzled with all this it's like I don't know I feel like once you you know once once you had to like put the whole art department on adding a reference to a game it's like that's a little that's maybe a little too much like spend a lunch break on it and uh call it a day I this all this stuff that you guys are talking about in terms of like um references to other games and stuff this all came like I think much later like this was not part of the initial like development of this game like and and also to be clear like there are a lot of references to other games there might be like 15 weapons that you get from other games but there's like 200 weapons that are like unique to this game so it's not it's not a huge portion and those are just the ones that sort of stand out the I think though they do frontload them which is something you probably did not experience like they frontload the the other game references as far as I can tell that's probably yeah I mean not that this is an excuse but that's probably because they were kind of shoehorned in the game after the fact to be like okay we can add this weapon and so like let's put it somewhere early because we want people who have played the game for a long time to actually encount to see it can you imagine imagine someone who's never played Hotline Miami like playing oh this is my first ever video game I'm going to pick up dead cells what the heck is this like weird TV room in here doing and I'm picking up a phone and I mean there are definitely a couple of them that I'm like I don't know if this is a reference to something or not yeah like I'm sure it is but I don't know there's just a lot of like like lore rooms l o r e which I eventually turned off in the options menu because you just go in it you turn it off yeah you can turn it off because there's often nothing very useful in them and like they're like oh there's a bunch of old Diaries from The Alchemist who used to live here and you're like great that helps me not at all and then when you actually sort of get to that um final reveal of like here is the ultimate villain it was not it was not particularly exciting uhu yeah I thought it was pretty wild how they revealed that uh the protagonist actually cut his own head off uh yeah as part of a devious PL I hope that's not actually like real it's it's not far off I'll say interesting so so Woody I guess like I only just like beat quote unquote beat the game the first time like a few hours ago and one of the like principal draws of dead cells is like all right you've zero boss cells you've beaten the tutorial congratulations you're ready for the real game it's the same as Hades I mean it's the same aesthetic I mean when you would you consider that when you go and escape the underworld and beat Hades for the first time like the game is beaten like I I certainly wouldn't because like there's a hug am of yeah exactly but in in Hades there's like there's a a drive to explore that narrative more like once you've once you've done that with dead cells I mean obviously narrative light that's not what we're coming here for really specifically but like we're coming here for like oh okay I've beaten the game now I'm On One bossell like I was I was kind of expecting like H yeah it's just going to be the same but maybe a little a little more difficult but uh because I think rise of the giant DLC is free now like you so you go through like the end credit sequence you get some like nice lore drop stuff like okay like this maybe I could be convinced to to try another run here that was pretty satisfying um but you you can unlock like Colin and Andrew you've probably seen some of these doors throughout your plays that have like little like circles like one two three or four circles on them that you're like hm I wonder what's behind that door and those are things that you open up on higher boss sell difficulties right Woody and um I mean no I'm gonna head off your question here to say there's nothing that exciting behind them I will say like when you play it on one cell difficulty or zero zero cell difficulty you've essentially seen the whole game yeah like the the game is not going to like have some big reveal at like three you know when you open a three cell door that's like whoa this is a whole new sort sort of biome or level that i' never seen or this whole other mechanic um but the game just like scales super super well like it's weird and this is the case with gungon or like many other Rog likes is like you'll be bashing your head against like you know the base level difficulty for 20 hours and then you sort of keep putting cells into like that meta progression to unlock like have most of your weapon drops be higher level and then you go back and like when I play at zero cell difficulty in this game it's essentially a joke and because like not because like I'm particularly great at this game but just because like the I've unlocked so many weapons and like they they all drop a pretty high quality and like I just have a good feel for like how things synergize at this point and so like it feels like I'm barely taking any damage like even when enemies hit me um because at higher cell difficulties mostly dudes just kill you way faster and it becomes way more important to just avoid damage and so like I think that this game really just does a great job of always feeling like it's at the right level of difficulty except like I said when I got to the final boss on five five cells like no more of this um but most of the time it stays at a pretty satisfying level of difficulty and you can I think you can play this game and get to two or three cells and just happily be like all right I've seen enough of this it's starting to get frustrating and there's a ton of different Final Bosses as part of all the DLC there's a there's a queen final boss who has like these minions who Trace you up this treehouse and those guys that is that is quite the boss fight and quite the experience that is that is worth trying um but yeah I think that there are plenty of ways to play this game and for a game that costs less than $2 probably with all the DLC at this point or like somewhere around close to it you're going to get your money's worth even if you like only beat it on like the default right for everything on sale right now oh oh okay nice uh I got to fired up on my phone on my way back I'm out and about um so uh yeah and and I mean and and to reiterate you know once uh what do you you know once you've gotten to you know two sales three CS whatever and it's like well I've kind of seen everything it's like you're at 60 hours plus yeah you gotten your money's worth absolutely like that's that's fantastic um indeed good stuff so uh this game takes a lot of notes from you know Metroid and Castlevania and it is uh right people people call it a Metroid Vania right sure is that is that a thing yeah it's it's a little more that way at the start of it because there are a couple aspects of like runes that you can get that allow you to like do the ground stomp or do like a wal to wall wall climb indeed yeah exactly which allow you to sort of progress to different biomes that you never seen which I think is a good way to actually lead you into the game because the first time you play this game there's kind of only one path that you go go on because you can't get to the some of the other exit um and so it does a good job sort of giving you um the easier levels before it starts barraging you with a bunch of options but once you get those like initial five or six runes um like that no longer becomes the facet of the game and then it's not really a Metroid Vania anymore at that point because there's no backtracking like indeed indeed I guess I I did want to I don't discuss that aspect of it a little bit that I appreciated the way that it handles those upgrades which I'm not sure if there's you know an official Metroid Vania term for this but it's like you know oh you know you can't get through this part of the map because you can't reach a particular jump but then you unlock the ability to double jump for example and then you're explore more of that it's been my experience that in uh in well Castlevania games specifically like finding those upgrades wasn't like exciting like it is in dead cells it was kind of a pain in the butt it's like oh no I have an abil now I have like you know the the werewolf's pogo stick so now I need to try to remember like where in the map did I see that random spot that I didn't understand earlier and then I'd have like waste a bunch of time and inevitably go into a Wiki blah blah uh that's less of an issue with like I don't know yeah Sy but anyway so the way it's handled in this game it's like it felt a little more uh yeah it felt good to get those upgrades and then also it just sort of at no point when I was playing the game did I feel like oh I am I'm gonna hit any dead end there's no like dead feels like smart way to um to like gatekeep some of like the weirder levels where like oh in order to get to this level where you have to stay by the lanterns you know you have to make some mechanic oh I love that well explained definitely didn't die let's hold hold off there I have a couple of strong criticisms that I'm waiting to start levying against this game it's not anyway this G is super great because no go ahead I I don't I don't necessarily want to get into it right now um I think that the the lack of backtracking in this game is excellent the way that they do the portals to teleport H very good so good like running through levels that you've already or like platforms that you've already beaten all the bad guys in not particularly interesting being able to just like run through something and teleport back like alleviates so much of that like oh should I go which should I go left or right like well I have to try and choose the one that I know dead ends first so that when I backtrack then I go down the main item It's like because I I have that analysis paralysis in all video games where like I need to see everything in this level and this is like well H if you go down one and it's the wrong choice you just teleport to the other one see it and then go back and what I eventually did too with the accessibility options one of those is like start with the map reveal because like basically and it just shows you the whole M because basically what you want to do there's no like this game incentivizes you to go fast by like unlocking um a special door that gives you a good weapon but like there's nothing like Risk of Rain where like the longer you go the harder the game gets or something so basically your one goal is like every biome you want to make sure you get every scroll that's there and So eventually I just got sick of like perusing for every scroll and it's like by having the map unlocked at the start I can just go right there yeah I think that's probably pretty because I mean the while those is done very well the procedural generation layout of the maps um navigating the maps is is is interesting but it's not a Hu it's not like a starring feature I guess navigating is not exciting it's the fighting the things while you're navigating that's exciting and once you put in like an egregious amount of time in this game and you've walked through you know the Forgotten culture like a whole bunch of times you just kind of get sick you're ready to forget it I just yeah exactly and you just are ready to move on to the next part that like said is the exciting part of fighting enemies well good on the devs for including such reasonable options this game just has an absurd amount of content that has been added after the fact like there's a custom mode that allows you to just do a whole bunch of like weird cheating things where we can like have every weapon that drops be legendary as like a fun way to explore the different mechanics there's a thing that like gives you no you can just enable like having no cool Downs on any of your grenades and you're like just breaks the game but it's just sort of built in as an option to sort of mess around with um yeah I think that this game does a really good job of appreciating that everyone has a different tolerance for frustration and everyone um you know wants to play the game the way that they want to play the game and like this game does a very good job enabling that right rather than like downloading weird mods to do it you just can click a button in the thing be like you're not going to get the achievements for but we don't care go for it go nuts you've already given us your money we don't care how you play our game yeah uh well is it time to start levying criticism because I have one I feel like that should be like a you guys need like a little sound Stinger for colins like time to Levy some criticisms and you're like criticism Levy I feel like we've only been saying good things so I do want to like this is probably something that you Woody can no longer empathize with because you've played 200 hours but sure this game is very bad at explaining how it works okay it does not tell you how its mechanics function I learned like 15 minutes before we started this podcast how parrying Shields work which is onethird of the the items you have to tap to Parry if you tap and hold it doesn't Parry very well like it just blocks it just blocks and you don't parry and so I was just like I don't know how to Parry I'm just going to ignore onethird of the items in this game sure because they don't feel fun and it's because they never explain to you how that system works I only found out because I was like I wonder what that weird number is next to the shields is that like why does it have a thing that lets you that's like the the crit thing like oh by the way also Shields do damage like what they never explained that um and they're like yesterday or the day before the Forgotten SE Seer that level with the lights and stuff in it um I was just like standing there I was like oh and I just randomly died yeah my health is going down at an alarming rate yeah like why did I die I had I was like searching the internet I'm like is there like some sort of weird like my trap was shooting at some enemy is there some enemy that like interacts with traps to hurt you and it's like oh no I needed Scott and Andrew to tell me like uh that the light if you're outside of the light for a while it starts doing damage to you it's like it does not it does not tell you that is true and that that feels especially bad in like a Rog likee game where you're like oh I made it to this level I've never been to how exciting I'm farther than I've ever been and then you die for random crap and you're like I don't know what that was because this was a new level with a new mechanic yeah so I I feel like there's a lot a lot of this game it doesn't do a good job of explaining how it works and then if you're like okay I need to go look at the Wikipedia or the the wiki to to do it it's like there is an overwhelming amount of content on it so you get bogged down looking at like every single weapon thing like is there something weird with these weapons blah blah blah and like oh I forgot to ever look up just like how does basic mechanics yeah like or even the thing like how much damage does a crit do I thought that it it so when it shows you the weapon value it says like 111 in white text and in the next to it it has a little yellow text with in parentheses and then it says DPS I thought that the yellow text was the DPS it's not all of its DPS the yellow value is the crit DPS like it doesn't explain that Andrew finding out this right now like it it doesn't explain and like you basically have to go to the wiki to learn how like core mechanics of the game works which is very as we' done this podcast that's very that's very dark cells of it yeah yeah I don't I don't like that no me neither um and especially as we've gotten further into this podcast I've become less forgiving of that kind of stuff like it your game you should not have to use the internet to to understand how the game you're playing works it should it might maybe you have to go like read the encyclopedia but you should be able to figure out how everything in the game works within the game you know what this game is missing I started up a fresh file speed or um save just to like make sure like oh well like what if someone's listening to this podcast they've never played dead cells before what's their first player experience uh like you first start the game and you have like this helpful little night person who's like welcome to dead cells this way please and like you have these very standard kind of sword and board weapons to start off with I feel like that should have done that tutorial maybe a little better there is like a thing I think I don't know if you have to unlock this but there is like a little training Gra that you can play in to be like all right like set the enemy types and just run around and Bash them and like I don't know if you take damage or anything but it's very much like a Sandbox but like it's it's worth calling out when games do tutorial isation well especially in this type of genre and I don't think there's really any tutorial for this game other than you know you start you you're a goo that unceremoniously just plops on the ground and absorbs into a someone's decapitated body uh and then have fun you're on your own like set off into this world to to explore it kind of a deal so there is and like for your first run you don't need it but like the fact that there's not a thing that you can go back and be like okay now I want this real tutorial yeah the thing that that like I spent 25 hours without realizing this and this like dead cell dead dead heads will be listening and be like what do these people even play this game like I played 25 hours with trying to like get the Scrolls to balance out the power numbers instead of focusing all on one oh well no again you would think that's you know yeah the different stat Scrolls that you're talking about that would be a very common mistake is because basically the Scrolls color that you have the least of gives you the most health bonus yeah and so you kind of assume like oh if I want to build like with the most health I should get the biggest variety of scroll colors and it used to I kind of feel like it used to be more that way they've kind of fine-tuned the way the stat Mechanics Work in this um for a long time and now it is very much just like get all the same color but yeah just like you said that bit and then a scre and everyone will you what the hell are you doing get all the same colors the other thing that I don't know like I'm still also kind of like wishy-washy on like the the item tearing system where it's like oh I got like buz saww buz saww I I I plus plus is that better than IVs or frankly I've played 200 hours of this game I don't even I don't even really understand that I wish that that was not so confusing I wish they just kept it's actually very very simple if you go read the wiki uh h plus is uh the equivalent of two extra levels so why don't they just add more levels to it why don't they just make the number higher like yeah I don't know so B but but like literally it's so if you have like a three plus that's the equivalent of a five like it literally in the back end of the game just adds two more to it so like an L the legendary version is plus eight so a three L is equivalent to like an 11 also why do they go plus plus L instead of just like B I don't know or b s like I don't know plus s you know for all for all those dead heads you know or for anyone who's like a friend of a friend of one of the devs like you know let's be clear like the fact that we're having such nitpicky pedantic complaints is a great sign for how fantastic the core gameplay is like you know we've got love to talk about then uh so from like the the the naming conventions sure but yeah I didn't even get into the minut of that it is kind of silly though I will admit and I I tend to agree that like the communication of stuff is not Is Not Great The Shield stuff like yeah uh I'll to I'll to try to do more parrying like I I thought it was I thought I didn't realize that there was a difference between tapping and yeah I've done 15 minutes of it and I was like oh it feels great now yeah I I I in all my many many years of playing video games like the idea of holding up a shield has always been so so foreign to me like I ne the only time I think I've ever like consciously used a shield in a game is where you had to bounce back the deu nuts in Ocarina of Time like to actually proceed in the game and other than that I'm just like a shield May might as well not exist and so like when it does it's Mario Kart style you have to hit it at exactly the right moment but then you hold the fact that it's you have to do it at the right time and then let go possibly foreign I would never in a million years have just interesting that that's odd because I just remember that that clicking with me and I'm like oh actually this is the first time like a shield has been satisfying to use and maybe that's because like I knew even though I hadn't played a bunch of Dark Souls going into this like I knew that comparison and like parrying in Dark Souls is a big part of that game yeah it's a separate button though sure yeah I was from that perspective as well but anyway well probably I've never played Dark Souls yeah that's fine ring soul elen ring El Rings I've played all of the Elden ring games yeah exactly uh do we want to transition to rankings uh tie up tie up our last game of this season of games that we've played uh maybe I'll Andrew I'll put you on the spot first for Let's Do It Rock and Roll sounds good uh yeah sells uh I'm glad that I'm finally playing it um it is very enjoyable I like it a lot um I don't know if we discussed uh I mentioned very briefly the animations animation work is really great um I love I love seeing a 3D rendered door open up uh I I do like destroying them as well but seeing that swing open that that low poly door that's set on a 2d background is just I love to I love yeah love to see it I love to see it uh in particular and there's a lot of animations that are just oo like just so silky smooth that they they trick your brain for a minute like oh may maybe this is a 3D thing like for example the the the starting Archer enemy as they bring up the bow is is very sleek and smooth and uh also always love a game that has a custom low Health animation I think the first time I saw it was like max pain one if you're low enough Health oh he holds the stomach uh Mr ninja Mr dead Suman does the same thing and uh it's great so uh anyway I'm plopping this down at number six in my ranking list it maybe it should be higher in terms of like my personal preferences probably higher but I don't want it to take over Rim World um it's right it's right there it's neck and neck but just out of respect for our missing HST our missing crew member uh I I gotta keep Rim world uh at number five and this game dead cells at uh dead cells yeah I think this will this will Top out at number two on the jarts for for the Scott rankings uh just behind my number one still cogmind and just ahead of number three risk of rain uh I think like all and like these rankings at the top are like kind of meaningless because they're all like so close together but like there was a moment when I was playing on on the steam deck in airplane mode on and I had like this really solid run going I'm like okay great like I'm GNA quit here and then like I'll pick it back up on the desktop like you know turn the steam deck back on uh and it didn't syn the the save like the save was just totally lost to time and I was like oh my God I had such a good run going uh and there there are games and there are times where that would just be like my end of that game just be like you know what I've experienced enough of the game I think I got it that can be like a make or break decision uh that was not a make or break decision here I think like that was very much a well let's start a new run and see what happens this game definitely has that just one more run pull that you want from this kind of genre really good um I think like the aesthetic I think the art design for this game is is amazing uh the main character yeah is okay but you have like 500 different skin you can play as Sonic the Hedgehog as your skin is though uh you can be a snowman you can be Santa Claus like I played a good chunk of this as the Ironclad from slay the Spire your options are Limitless uh the game play is perfectly fluid it seems like when you get items that synergize really well you feel invincible and that's like such a good feeling in in a game where difficulty can be like really punishing it feels like a very good way to be like ah I've got you game uh and then when like the soundtrack kicks in and you got like the float your characters ninja running all around you're it's just everything locks into place and it feels so perfect so it's going to be it's going to be a number two for me like just behind cogmind which I think is the best in class of traditional Rogue likes I think this is maybe the best in class for like your meta progression action platformer Colin you're up next um i' would say that so this game if if a game doesn't have a good enough story or Aesthetics I feel like I just compress it into do not care about it at all um story irrelevant to me could have no story would make no difference in my uh ranking of this game Aesthetics eh they're fine makes no difference in the ranking of this game it's still my number three uh of games that we've played because it doesn't matter the gameplay flow of this game is so good it just feels good to play it and like that is the the core of like running through getting that sense of speed like I most of the ones I do I play brutality which is the like get up in there in melee don't worry about blocking don't worry about shooting from afar just like get in slash around moving constantly doing everything running as fast as you can it just feels so fun and fluid to play um like it could be just little abstract cubes on a screen and I would have the same amount of fun because the mechanics the execution of it is so good um I'm putting at number three despite being like the same rank as uh my number two game Monster train uh just because of I I literally dropped it right before we started this podcast because of the Revelation about shields because it's it's so frustrating to me that H how bad the the explanation of the game mechanics are like I I enjoyed the 15 minutes of playing with shields that I did like do I have like a whole second game to play that I didn't know about before because I didn't understand how a third of the mechanics of the game works may maybe probably not but like I'm excited to at least like test it out um and it frustrates me that I got you know I've put 18 hours into this game in the last seven days like that's a halftime job and I didn't know about like a core mechanic and I don't really feel like it was my fault so like there's still there there's I gave a 9.5 out of 10 there are a couple of like little little chinks in the armor to keep it from being a 10 out of 10 but still one of the one of the best games I've played in the last couple years bring us home bring us home your your games on list uh so far are number one is enter the gungeon and number two is FTL faster than light where does dead cells fit in here I mean I have the like nice benefit of only being on the Pod like to talk about games that I like because you asked me what games I wanted to be on for so like my list is kind of slanted I don't just like every game I just happen to like every game that I volunteer to be on the podcast for um I'm goingon to put this at number two um yeah my man dungeon rank Supreme baby dungeon rank Supreme um like I said I like the aesthetic like gungeon and dead cells are both just Joys to play and like the difficulty level feels right the whole way through um gungon like the Aesthetics and the humor is just more memorable to me and there's like there's weapons in gungon that when they drop I'm like very excited to try them and see how they work like in this game when I see a weapon I hadn't seen I'm like oh cool I'll try that but I'm not like I'm not a wash with joy the way I am with some of the weapons in gungon um but I do think this game is a total Delight to play Super addictive super fun like I said very happy with the many many hours that I put into it um and yeah I think that I I played I played the life out of this game um and mushed it mushed it back into the mush from where it where it can return um so yeah great game definitely definitely worth a try um and even yeah I think that the endorsement here that I think means the most is Collins because like he he was not big on on gungon because like it is kind of unforgiving at first um but like you know I think Colin correct me but like you found your way right into dead cells from the beginning and like even though I'm sure you were dying a lot like it's inviting right from the start and so I feel like that speaks really high that you can play it for a few hours and have a great time or you can put in tons of hours I will have to bring in our absent co-host Will's criticism which is Platformers are bad uh mad CZ bad sure Super Mario Brothers who needs it so it's I will say this game is not for everyone if you don't like Platformers just as a concept entirely it is still very much a platformer there's not actually that much platforming even in this game because it's not like platforming is a lot of like jumping from thing to thing to not die like most of the levels in this game don't have pits that you can fall into there are some spikes but like mostly the way that your character moves around like you're not doing a bunch of slow paced Precision jumping you are still doing a lot of jumping and moving though sure so if that's not your as unforgiving if 2D Sid scrolling jumping and fighting isn't your jam this is that game in Spades I like that for the most part it's not um like so for gungon I don't really like bullet held and this is not a bullet Hill so like there you go but like you could be the best bullet Hill it could be engine dungeon and maybe it wouldn't like it if you don't like Platformers if you don't like sides srly stuff this is that it's the best of that but if that's not your thing then don't play it there are a lot of other great games out there yeah like dead cells so for our similar games segment I was kind of like scratching my head a little bit because deels feels like such like its own unique thing of like this very fast-paced combat mild platforming elements not quite Super Mario World level but um but like other games that stunt that kind of stuck out as like oh these are kind of in the same vein of the dead cells uh realm would be uh Rogue Legacy one and two I think have a very similar kind of design aesthetic uh skull the hero Slayer in terms of like meta progression unlock stuff um Spirit Fall which is like a platformy sidescrolling uh um almost like smash like game if uh if you combine dead cells and Smash Smash Brothers um recently I think smash cells yep yeah um in Early Access right now a game called Oblivion override uh which has a very interesting demo very much more yeah it's a oh really sells but robots um I think Woody you and Andrew I think have played Super House of dead ninjas before yeah that game's that game's fine it's not it's not much anything to my to my memory it's it's literally not much of anything to me because I I don't think I have played it actually I think it's like a throwaway Adult Swim game where like ninas come at you and you attack them it's yeah very fast-paced platformer is um and another game that's come out that has kind of uh purist fans of the property uh shaking their heads a little bit uh Blas blue entropy effect uh a very interesting game that like kind of has nothing to do with the Blast blue franchise but maybe like vaguely themed about it question mark but again another it's got to be blaze blue right what is you sound like you sound like a huge huge D BL what what is with all these kids in their ey spaces and I honestly don't know cuz I don't know if I've ever talked to someone about blaze blue I just I can't imagine that they would name it it be called Blas BL the way it's spelled maybe the typography I don't know there's no e yeah no I'm not I'm I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying when you someone pronounce it you're like how did anyone decide to name it that whenever I go to Taco Bell I always get a BL Baja blaz yeah exactly Baja blaz okay um but uh hey uh well that's it's all good such as life uh interesting but so there's a new blaze blue well yeah the push it's like rogy the push back from the Steam Reviews is like it's it's a it's like a Japanese anime fighting fighting game okay Street Fighter but yeah it's like it's like Guilty Gear if if there was a street fighter Rog likee game that was like said in the street fighter universe and didn't have any of the Street Fighter care in it but it's still said Street I totally understand based on that explanation exactly what it is yeah gotcha gotcha gotcha lots of I think Rogue Legacy is is far in way the best comparison um except I think dead cells is way better than Rogue Legacy just in terms of how it features I mean I think honestly if you're going to be starting to compare it to games you you really have to start comparing it to games that aren't Rogue likes Hollow kn shovel KN other night based games Castlevania like that those are its closest comparison for for a lot of the like the mechanics um but it it feels a lot it's a lot faster and because you are expected to die and not start the game from the beginning yeah uh in in like Hollow night so well as we wind down here uh if you want to send in your own Corrections for how Blas blue is pronounced I honestly want to know now please send in a correction confirm that it is not pronounced Blast blue cuz my mind will be blown right in at.com uh Grog pod Zone gmail.com for your your pronunciation your pronunciation cor Corrections uh we're on Mastadon at Grog podame dev.
