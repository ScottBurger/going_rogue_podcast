Greetings friends and welcome to the grog pod roguelike podcast where each stop on this railway of a podcast, we unload our our ratings and we cram in all of the the feedback that we get to see if that that train is gonna get to the end of the station at the end of the season with some good numbers.
0:41
As you can probably tell, I didn't write something down for this segment this time, but yeah, we we look at at rogue ish games and rank them and if they're good and if that train doesn't go flying off of the Cliff the end of the end of the season, then it'll come Choo chooing back into our end of season recap episode.
1:00
I am your your Titanic host of the podcast Scott Berger and with me are my angelic or demonic Co hosts.
Well, this is Will Wright.
I was going to be a Titan that for some reason wants to attack Heaven, but apparently I can't do that now, so I don't know.
1:18
I get taken.
Angel, this is Will Wright.
Yeah.
And it's Colin the Smith that you find along the way who's making some stuff for you.
Smith.
Andrew is currently out on vacation this week, but he is missing out on us covering Monster Train Train Train 2 released May 21st 2025.
1:42
It's another kind of find it anywhere game, PC, Xbox, PlayStation, switch, and This was developed by our returning developers, Shiny shoe, who in 2020 released the game that we covered almost 1000 days ago, monster train 1.
2:03
And I remember I I re re listened to that episode 'cause I'm like, how different was the podcast since then?
And turns out very different In that episode.
I was talking about like, oh boy, I can't wait for them to release this game called inkbound, which had then released.
I also think this is also kind of interesting to take a our first stop on the monster rail here, because I think this may be kind of underscores maybe our thoughts about how we feel about Monster Train 2 as well.
2:30
So Inkbound was their game that they did four years after Monster Train one.
It was like a turn based Hades like game with like 4 player online Co-op.
It's, it's very unique and weird, but when it first launched, but it had like all these weird live service microtransactions attached to it and everybody hated it.
2:54
It was widely panned.
And then the devs, I think maybe wisely stopped development of it because they're like, Oh no, this is going the reverse direction on the rails.
And we wanted to.
So they stopped development on it.
And then they took all their live service stuff and were just like, here, just have it, just have it.
3:10
Just we're moving on.
We're moving on to something else, and that's something else was Monster Train 2.
But after they did that, the ratings for that game kind of rebounded pretty substantially.
And people, I think, are clambering for, ironically, some more Inkbound.
Content must meet those microtransactions.
3:29
Yeah, you got you got to get that dope drip.
This was published by a different publisher this time than Monster Train One, which was Good Shepherd Entertainment.
Monster Train 2 is published by Big Fan Games.
Ironically I think their games don't have many big fans for them because they developed 2018 reigns Colon, Game of Thrones 2020 they developed or published a John Wick hex followed by Hellboy.
3:56
Web of word with AY and then just with monster train 2 very recently.
I don't know if they're Tron colon catalyst game is any good, but weirdly they they also have a major get with Warhammer 40K bolt gun 2 coming out.
4:18
It's it's 2026 already almost in next year.
But yeah, I think it's safe to say monster train 2 is their biggest publishing offer so far.
This rolls into the popularity stop.
I'm going to see how many of these tortured train quote UN quote jokes I can slam in here.
4:37
This is the number 167th most popular rogue game on steam with 8444 total reviews.
Your average your average player of monster train 2 has about 91 hours of gameplay in it.
Your average average player 91 hours.
4:55
I mean I I guess it did come out last year so there is that.
But but Colin, you are tasked with the one sentence spell combo synergy that describes what one does in Monster Train 2.
You play monster train one but with more stuff.
5:14
Brilliantly put, Colin.
Absolutely end the episode there.
Yeah, there we go.
Well, I think that that does kind of kick off this first question that I have here from my Google Doc that is not 150 pages long compared to the last episode.
I think 1 theme that I have sort of slated for this season is sequel Itis.
5:37
And I was excited when Colin picked Monster Train 2.
So I'm like, oh, OK, great.
This is falling right into my plans here.
What?
And I don't know if this is like something that the answer to this is different for Rogue Games specifically, but like what makes for a good sequel to a game?
5:55
Big new mechanics where you take the best, here's here's what you do.
You take the best stuff from the previous one.
You use that, You drop the stuff, you actually have to remove some content and then you add in new ideas and then hopefully that all integrates really nicely together.
6:11
Yeah, I'm thinking of right now like the sieve, Sieve 345 like, you know, they, they actually removed some of the bad things and they improve it and well, I guess you could say maybe use 6 better, I don't know, but.
Yeah, I think, I think there's a big difference in between games like Final Fantasy where there's this a sequel is fundamentally a new and different story.
6:29
And then stuff like roguelikes or SIM City or Sieve or any of those other things where it's like or, or Crusader Kings, all of the Paradox games where they're, they're trying to make refined the product.
And I think in some ways it's like, OK, you've pushed whatever you, whatever jank you had behind the scenes as far as it can go.
6:51
You've like, I know Crusader Kings too.
They had like what 18 DLCS or some crazy shit and they're, they were like, we literally cannot add any more.
The the system is breaking.
We have to rewrite this game from scratch because we cannot stuff any more DLC in.
7:09
That's your standard Paradox game approach though, right?
Just like.
Yeah, I mean, I think that is a good reason to do a sequel though 100.
Percent.
Yeah, like sometimes it's, you know, you need to like rebuild the, the base game a little bit, rebalance things in a way that like people would get mad at if you did it to your, your, your actual current game that's well optimized for everything.
7:36
Yeah, so like we, we haven't covered a whole lot of sequel games on this podcast, but that's like totally emblematic of Darkest Dungeon 2 where it's like a a strong departure from the original, which I I can, I'll, I'll give them a little bit of points for like trying something new, even if it doesn't work just like trying something new, but running the risk of like pissing off all their user base in the process, like.
8:01
Wait, the mechanics you add have to actually be good?
That's the thing.
That's the requirement of, yeah.
But like we also, if we can remember way back when to covering hand of fate to like that was that felt like, you know, like it was an established system thing that like add some more stuff to it.
8:18
You know, it's effect basically the exact same game, but like a little bit different because you have like maybe this little bit of like open world traversal system to it.
And then you have stuff that's like risk of rain to which is just like what if just the first game but in 3D and it plays like completely differently.
8:36
I'm also.
I mean I feel like Risk of Rain too feels more like a different game set in the same universe.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, like moving from 2D to 3D is like a major mechanical and like game engine totally, totally different as a result.
8:52
But like also something like like Doom the Rogue, like like Doom RL to like Jupiter, hell, totally separate engine.
Like the gameplay mechanics are like roughly the same, but like 3D versus pure 2D kind of thing.
So like we haven't really covered a whole lot of of sequels here.
9:09
But yeah, I I was also kind of curious to see what like Andrew's first impressions were with Monster Train 2, having not played the first one.
But but you know, maybe if this survives 2 Omega Bowl season, Andrew can revisit it then.
9:25
But yeah, I was kind of surprised to see that, like when reviews were coming out for Monster Train Two, it was like the second coming of like Monster Christ, almost 'cause like, what do we got here?
This like a screenshot from like Metacritic back, back when?
And it's like clear, obscure Expedition 33 is like #1 no surprise blueprints #2 I could see that.
9:47
Sure.
Split fiction #3 like a kind of cool Co-op style game #4 Monster Train 2 on that list.
And I don't know if things have changed substantially since then, but like, the critics are just like pissing their pants about this.
10:03
So it's like this, this like, Monster Train is back, bitch.
And this time it's more monstery than ever.
And I was like, OK, sweet, I'm, I'm in.
I'm excited to have my monster socks blown off.
And then I think.
I mean, it's been on the list for a while.
10:19
Like it was on the we're going to play this eventually, it's just unclear when.
And I feel like my first impression with it was like exactly what you said of like, oh, it's it's Monster Train one.
Yeah, yeah, it feels like.
DLC, yeah.
Like, well, we can, we can maybe get into like the new mechanics and changes and stuff that they added in, but.
10:41
Which is 2 things, right?
They're like 2.5 things like that's, that's my take on it.
They.
Added six things on my list.
They added.
Well, the real thing is they they added in equipment and they added it in rooms.
Yeah, that's like those are the two things.
And then like the other kind of half point I'm giving them is like there's a deployment phase now, which is like slightly different than Monster Train one where it just kind of changes the dynamic where it's you're less likely to put all your good things on one guy and kind of maybe space it out a little more.
11:10
But that's.
Yeah, I mean, like, yeah.
So I think like the the deployment phase is like is the biggie.
Because before it was like you had this very nebulously defined concept like banner in units where like your your units had like little, little like hard to see banners on the sides of them.
And those had like this weird calculus behind the scenes of like those had a higher chance of coming out in every card draw.
11:33
But this is like an actual just like, all right, get get your shit out on the board plan, plan your strategy first.
And I remember seeing this.
I'm like, oh, OK, this is this is cool.
Like this is giving me a little bit more like authorial intent behind it.
And I remember Monster train one being like once I once I got the the train wheels rolling on it, I remember it almost being like comically easy of like, oh man, like now that I've rocked the systems, like this is just like baby mode here.
12:02
Yeah, I feel like Monster Train one had a lot of like, if you hit the right draws early, it's easy, and if you don't, you lose.
Yeah, like like depending on what your build is.
Which is so we we all beat our first run playing this one.
12:18
Right, right.
Not even close if I recall.
No, I think my second run I.
Think it took me like 5 * 5 runs to get my first win maybe yeah.
I can't recall.
No, I, yeah, 'cause my, my pattern was I played it right when the game came out for like 6 1/2 hours and then put it down.
12:36
And then I played one game before this podcast to remind myself of why that was the case.
Well, yeah, so like, I guess maybe that kind of speaks to the I, I feel like there's like a division between like Slay the Spire households and Monster Train households where like some people, some people grow up with Pokémon and that's fine.
12:57
And they're, they're, they're pokey freaks for the rest of their lives.
Some people grow up with Digimon and holy shit do they love those.
Nasty little freaks.
I know and this I don't know what.
Is the Digimon.
This feels like the Digimon to to slay the Spires Pokémon in a way.
13:15
Interesting, I like that.
That's a fair assessment, I think.
Yeah, definitely.
Because there's definitely people that really, really like this game and get like super deep into it.
I mean, I gave, I gave.
The first monster train, a 9.5.
It's my what, 3rd, 4th?
It's tied, tied, tied for fifth.
13:32
So there you go.
It's pretty high up there.
Mine I think is my 29th ish highest ranked game for Monster Train one or something.
But yeah, I mean like, I don't know, I thought at the time Monster Train 1 was like, oh, this is neat and different and I gave it a lot of points for like being being weird and like something that I hadn't seen before.
13:53
And in the what did I say?
When did Monster Train one come out in the five years since?
I mean, but you know, it's it does maybe look slightly different.
I was, I was trying to like magnifying glass up to the monitor and like, are these are these is it doing that thing where it's like technically a 3D model, but it looks like it's kind of 2D, like how how Hades does some other stuff.
14:19
But yeah, I, I, I definitely felt like, like, I'm like, oh man, booting it up for the first time and then clicking and selecting your, your, your heroes and your, your clans that you, you pick and immediately having the wave of, of memories come back with the moaning unit sound.
14:45
Effect.
I'm going to write that down, too.
Yeah, I got that.
I hate that shit.
There's a couple where like I'll say for the most part, like the music in this game extremely good.
The music sound effects are a little bit weird.
15:01
There's a couple times where it like you hit it like the the enemies hit your units with a shield or something and it makes like a weird like boik sound that just is extremely off putting to me.
Well, one thing I wanted to bring up was like, OK, the the sound effects like when your hero units are attacking the other hero units.
15:20
I don't remember if we talked about this last time, but I, I like, I almost had to turn them off and just like only listen to the music because.
And I, I was curious to get your guys's take on this because other games also have like annoyingly repeated sound effects, but maybe aren't as grading for some reason.
15:39
And I kept thinking back to like StarCraft, where like StarCraft, you're hearing like the same units, like, like talking to, Yeah, like clicking on an overlord.
I read it, Sir.
But like.
But we're still quoting those 25 years later, so.
15:55
Yeah, so so maybe like 7 year olds who are growing up with Monster Train are like, oh, you know, like setting their cell phone ringtones to like the the.
I certainly hope not.
But like, is it, is it just that like those sound effects hit us at the right time to like freeze our neurons in place and we're just like, oh, these like these kids with these new Monster Train sound effects that just sounds super grating?
16:20
Is is it just like we're at the wrong place in space-time for it to hit us?
I mean, I feel like they're not good, but they're not.
I didn't find them to be like distractingly bad.
Oh, they they're distracting.
No, I it yeah, the the moaning is it's it's way over the top.
16:37
I don't know of any other game that has this degree of annoyingness with the moans.
And it really is character dependent too.
Like if you, if you pick the, the, the female character, right, you, you get them.
It's almost like a sexualized, it's like this.
16:53
It's, it creeps me out a little bit 'cause I, this is like a, a kind of sort of a children's game in terms of aesthetics.
And then you have these like really too much with the moaning.
And so, yeah, if they actually said something like take that or like gotcha, you know, then, you know, give me something that's not the moaning.
17:12
I mean, I do remember you just liking pretty, pretty intensely the Orcs must die.
People who were saying stuff like think that.
You know what, That's true.
No, I think it's just, it's just, is it just like the, the, the, the voice actors?
Is it the phrases?
It's like a combination of things, I think.
17:29
I don't know.
It's cringe I don't want.
Cringe.
Yeah, that's what it is.
I don't.
Like Speaking of, did you do you, did you guys do any of the story, read any of the story things like Jesus Christ, this is one of the first games I'm like actively, please don't have a story.
17:45
This was so this was another one of the bullet points that I had under changes from Monster Train one which OK, so like it's a quick, quick over overview.
We got some new clans.
We have dimensional challenges, deployment phase units with activated abilities.
We have an undo button.
18:01
Crucially, you have the ability to like kind of like partially hide your cards so you can see more of the battlefield.
And then you have equipment cards that can be held by someone, monsters.
And then there's the story mode, quote UN quote story mode, which I feel like there's there's something that's trying to get out there, but it's just like so like weirdly implemented like that, like that.
18:26
It feels like they're so I don't know, like like conflicting directions for like what the game's style is where the, the actual like, I felt like the actual like art on the cards looked good.
18:44
And then you deploy the card to the battlefield and then it just becomes like this horrendous, like complicated mess of like like Hearthstone or like post post Wow Blizzard graphics of like the like the fantasy, like a fantasy art that's like too much where like the sword has like all the extra notches in it because it's.
19:05
All man, I wrote that I wrote that down exactly.
It's like it's the the beveled notched metal that they just put absolutely everywhere and it does.
And you meant Warcraft like that's it is just like this one style of cartoony Stu I I wish that there.
19:20
Was AII feel like it's not chibby, but it feels like the a a a a style equivalent of that.
And I don't know, there's no word for it, but we know when we see it.
And this is it works with dye had a hint of it.
19:36
And this is like we've turned it to the Max.
Which it's.
Just made me ignore it completely.
Like I'm just like, well, I'm just, my brain is just stripping out all flavor and just seeing the the matrix numbers in the background.
'Cause this isn't really like, like that style is not like a genre.
19:52
I feel like we tend to like orbit around a lot.
Like I feel like.
Us.
I think it actively turns us off.
Yeah, it repels me it.
Disgusts me.
Like we're like, we're more interested in sort of like dark fantasy.
Is is Lord of the Rings dark fantasy?
Would you put that dark fantasy not high fantasy?
20:08
Is that high fantasy?
Lord of the Rings is like pre division of fantasy.
That's true.
You know, I I think it's oh, go ahead.
Lord of the Rings like created the genre of fantasy so they hadn't been like trope ized yet.
Really the best.
I mean, I think we all can agree the best style out there is your cycle one Western comic book style game.
20:27
I think that's the best out there, right?
StarCraft one StarCraft one best Best game aesthetics wise?
Because I was also, I was interested like to see how like the Wow like Blizzardification or like the, the wowification of like Blizzard graphics happened.
20:44
Because like some, there's one game that's coming up that has, is like pinnacle, pinnacle of like dark fantasy art that I that I really like.
And then it just kind of all went downhill from there.
And like you have like like original Warcraft or like Warcraft 2 fantasy, which is like basically just like reskin Warhammer in a way.
21:07
And then Wow comes out and then it's just like simplified, but also like very busy looking at the same time.
I don't know, like it's, it's safe to say that that's not our jam specifically, it's some people's jam because holy shit is Hearthstone popular And that is like.
21:25
Is it?
Is it so popular?
Yeah, it's super popular.
Like Woody loves Hearthstone and I feel like this is very Hearthstone adjacent in its art direction.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean Hearthstone's in that same genre of of art aesthetic.
21:42
But even then, like, I don't know, I wouldn't put Slate the Spire in that same category.
Like Slate, The Spire feels like its own weird like universe in a way.
I, I mean, I think a lot of it is like body proportions, how many notches are in the sword?
22:01
I I think actually will you really didn't have the right of it.
It was.
It's like beveled metal bits.
And it's not even that.
It's like layered.
If you look at the cards themselves, there's like, here's the outer layer, and then here's another layer behind that, and there's a three layers of different shapes of beveled metal sticking out from.
22:17
They don't look like cards at all.
They look like these horrible mutilated stacks of fucking swords just thrown on the ground.
I mean like OK, so so I'm posting in in the discord here a picture from Monster Train 2.
It's one of the one of the alternate heroes you can pick from the start and like gun to my head if you like had to had me ask like is this from Monster Train 2 or like Hearthstone or World of Warcraft?
22:43
I literally could not tell you I did not.
I did not unlock this person.
But apparently I'm reading from the the Monster Train 2 wiki page here because I've done this much level of prep that Talos, this hero was a major flying boss in ring three from the original Monster Train.
23:00
Which if you had three guns to my head, I could never tell you that.
But again, like people who've put 900 plus hours into Monster Train 1 and beaten everything, they're like holy shit.
Like I'm playing as one of the bosses.
I guarantee you if I had put 900 hours in this game, I still wouldn't be able to recognize this character like I would be able.
23:21
I would, I would say Talos.
And we're like, that name sounds familiar maybe.
But also Talos feels just like, that's just like a generic, like heavenly name.
So yeah.
We've seen it like in many games, right?
I think that was in what is it Oblivion I think was Talos.
23:37
Was there like Talos principal game?
Yeah, That's like, yeah, like Talos is just like a name.
It's Fred.
Holy shit I get to play as Fred?
Oh hell yeah, Fred.
I mean, that would be pretty funny if one of the one of the the the bad guys were just like a guy.
23:55
Just Fred.
That would be pretty cool.
Yeah.
So like I feel like the the art style is probably not for us.
It's definitely for some people, it's definitely not for us.
But the the gameplay here like if if all of the art here was just replaced with like like rectangles or.
24:12
The classic call in question which is if all style was stripped, would game still be fun?
I think in this case it would still be fun, yeah.
It would be exactly the same game that I played, which was the game where I just imagined there was no style on these things.
It improves it dramatically from my point of view because I'm actively disgusted by the the art that's there now.
24:31
And so, yeah, if that was out of there, I enjoy it much more.
Well, I'm going to all right, I'm going to, I'm going to cut that audio out and I'm going to play it on repeat for for when we eventually cover the game Dream Quest, which was the official very first rogue, rogue like dungeon deck builder game that looks like it just has like hand drawn Ms. paint art in it.
24:54
And for every time that will is going to be like the art in this game sucks.
I'm just going to like splice that clip in again and again and again.
And yeah, I think like in Monster Train 2, like the, the, the art on some of the cards is like maybe better or worse than some of the other ones.
But when you have like 7 of them on a line, it just becomes like this garbled mess of like, at that point, I'm not even looking at the cards.
25:15
I'm just looking at all of like the little abilities and stuff.
And I feel like that's fine.
I don't, yeah.
I like we've, we've trashed all the art for enough.
I feel like it's it's, it is whatever it is.
Yeah, like.
25:31
Is this game it art, art style aside, we're we're mostly just going to be comparing it to the first one.
And I feel like the two big things for me that are the big differences are oh, I forgot, there's actually there's a third big thing that they added, which was the activated abilities.
25:49
I feel like that's actually probably the biggest of the things, even more than equipment.
I feel like rooms are, I just say an unmitigated thumbs up.
I like the concept of rooms.
They don't rooms.
They don't make that much of a huge difference.
26:06
But I like that you can like futz around with your floors a little bit more.
Equipment is like interesting.
It does feel like ADLC and then activated abilities does feel like pretty different and I'm not 100% sure if it makes it better or not It's.
26:24
Just like complexity added for complexity's sake.
Yeah, that's, that's the IT, it makes it, it, it definitely makes like analysis paralysis higher.
'Cause I feel like they're for giving the player activated abilities.
It feels like the enemy should have some kind of equivalent of like, oh, well, we gave you activated abilities, that's great.
26:45
But the enemies have this other thing that's like, I don't know, some parallel universe thing that's kind of similar to it of whatever.
So that way you can like, oh, like I have this cool new thing, but the enemies also had this cool new thing.
It it felt for me that like the enemy units like kind of felt the same in terms of like what problems I had to solve.
27:07
Yeah, that's.
Definitely the fronts and then the the the weak healer in the back and the damage guy in the middle.
Like, you know, the classic.
Sort of yeah.
Oh, oh, the guy who gives them all haste so they go to the top floor.
Yeah.
I mean, there was some like the boss where there's the two bosses and they like give different buffs to each other.
27:28
If they like circle around is like a little bit interesting.
But I mean, I think it's a weird, there's a weird thing about this whole game is that it is a it is a, there is a absolute strict number of turns.
Like almost every combat is going to end in almost exactly the same number of turns, plus or minus what 1-2 you basically are.
27:50
You end at whatever the last wave is, or one or two more than that.
And there's something like 88 total combat encounters total.
Yeah, but like, it does limit some of your stride.
I'm like, I'm going to compare it to Slate aspire where like there are builds and Slate Aspire where you're like, all right, I'm just going to turtle while I build up something in the background and then do stuff.
28:10
You can't really do that in this game at all because there's always a set number of turns.
You can't like go crazy and finish it in like 3 turns because you haven't, you know, most of them you haven't even seen the boss after three turns, which I know there's some, there's some stuff that's like seems like you would want to be able to have it start like building up an engine and there the whole engine building thing starts getting a little bit weird because of that.
28:39
I mean I think that's probably and also would have been a Chrysalis infamous train 1 though.
We should probably talk about some of the new clans that are clashing in this game and some some hidden surprises with them too.
28:55
So we when you first boot up monster train 2, you're you're unlocked with two out of the five clans available and has the the same thing from the first one where you can't kind of like flip, who's like your primary clan and your secondary clan.
And I think the, the winning run that I most recently had was with the actually, let me, let me quiz you guys.
29:18
What's the so you start with a a blue and red faction to start with?
What are their names?
Can you remember?
The dragon and magic Pyrborn.
Wait, actually, no, sorry, they're not.
It's dragon and angels or whatever.
The third one's magic.
29:34
I yeah, I, I want to say Pyrborn, but I don't know.
They're like, yeah, the dragony dudes and then the other one I.
Pyrborn is one of them.
What's What's the?
Other one, no idea.
Angels angelic you start with the pirate born, the pirate born and the banished, who I believe the banished are former angels who have they're they're.
29:53
Like.
Yeah, so, so I think this game's plot rationale is now the angels of demons have teamed up to fight against the Titans for some reason.
And before it was like, you are Hell is being invaded by angels and you got to fight them back like you are you are demons.
30:11
You are the the you're playing as hell Hellerific demons fighting off angels as kind of like a reverse biblical kind of thing.
But now the angels and demons have teamed up and we're fighting against the Titans.
30:26
Question Mark and Colin, I think what what you were alluding to with the, the deep lore and great dialogue systems that we'll we'll touch on in a second, probably go more into detail about that.
But for the most part, it's just like, hey, here's some new clans to play with.
And the first ones that you start with are Yeah, Lord Phoenix, Dragon Man and Fell FEL, who is the champion of the Banished Clan.
30:52
I do actually remember Fell from the first game that was like the that's the like one of the first 3 bosses or something.
I think you fight them often.
It also feels good.
Feels a good name like the Fell Beast.
Maybe I should go back and play monster train 1 and be like, holy shit, it's it's fell from monster Train 2 and she's bad.
31:12
This anyway.
So like, yeah, you can, you can flip those guys back and forth and you're going through your, your standard monster train sequence of the rings of Heaven to go and fight the Titan Lord or something.
31:28
But you know, you're picking up cards and artifacts and changing out your, your pyre heart as well.
You're going through your different combat and event sequences along the way.
But as you as you unlock things and again, like the progression here is very objective driven instead of just like keep playing the game and I don't know, you get like whatever XP stuff to unlock the Luna coven, who Colin, I think is your magic magic clan.
31:59
You got to do that by defeating 40 enemies using spells and then to unlock the mushroom men, the under legion.
You got to do that by consuming 75 cards and then to unlock the the Lazarus league for that, you unlock them by doing some other thing that I do whip stuff, yes.
32:22
Basically just like play the game more times.
Yeah, just naturally use use the mechanics, use the mechanics a lot and then you'll unlock more toys to play with.
And I think I experimented with the the Luna coven and it was just kind of the first 3 ones for the most part.
32:39
But as you play through the game, you, you kind of have a progression meter at the bottom that says like you have X number out of six pyre hearts to unlock.
And that's kind of like you're driving your, what's conducting your, your train of progression systems to keep keep chugging along there.
33:00
And once you unlock the 6th pirate, did any?
Did either of you unlock the 6th Pyre Heart for the big super secret reveal?
The surprise?
No, no I didn't.
So, so you know, hit hit the Fast forward button here if you don't want monster train to like the explosive top secret revealed.
33:23
It's all the original clans from the first monster train when you yeah.
So I like, I think on paper that's a neat kind of thing to add of like, oh, like before.
Like if it's just the so each each of these clans has like 2 heroes you can pick from and that gives you like a decent amount of stuff to pick from.
33:42
But I actually did.
Yeah.
So if you have 5 initial clans with 10 options to choose, like 2, like flipping back and forth between them, if you add in the previous 5 ones that boosts like the decision pull up to 45 that you can pick from, which is a big deal.
But I'm like, I'm thinking like, OK, like that's a nice like thing to like pull back from the first monster Train, but it's literally the exact same art as all the 1st like the the hell or the the Hornbreaker Prince comes back for the hell horned and it's literally the exact same art asset from Monster train one as far as I can tell.
34:17
As far as I can tell, I don't know.
If you said.
They basically made this game in.
Like a year, right?
No, they had well.
OK, so I guess dialing back of it, they made Monster Train or Monster Train One came out in 2020, Inkbound in 2024, Monster Train 2 in 2025.
34:33
I don't know if they had like parallel development streams or I guess that's fair, they may.
Have been doing it the the whole time.
Yeah, but like Inkbound is like a a super.
Different game where it's like a 3D engine and like way different game mechanics and stuff.
34:49
I don't know if they wound up just like reusing the Monster Train 1 engine or and then just like Oh well, what if we just turn this DLC into a full-fledged thing here or what?
But yeah, I mean, like I I like the fact that all the old covenants or not covenants clans are in there, but like it feels a little cheap to have them all be the exact same art.
35:16
But maybe that really works for people that they're like, holy shit, Penumbra is back and you know, looks exactly the same and they can use them to beat whatever like super are are that are their abilities.
And all of their like cards the same I think so I didn't.
See anything to indicate that there there was like, like, yeah, I mean like.
35:40
What?
Because like.
The the and I, I could be totally off base here and if someone wants to like write in like 1 star of the podcast saying you guys didn't do your research, totally deserved because the, the new units have like activated abilities and stuff.
Yeah, I don't know if that's true for the old ones.
35:59
It could be I'm, I'm not, I'm looking, I'm like I'm scrolling as fast as I can here through the through the Monster Train 2 wiki.
I'm not seeing.
I'm just curious how it like you feel like?
You could possibly have it be balanced perfectly unless they were balancing the combats for the old ones and then also the new ones at the same time, but I don't know I mean you guys also it doesn't really matter if it's balanced perfectly.
36:24
I think this game is like.
Designed such that it's it's not supposed to be balanced.
And that's kind of like kind of the draw to it.
Where like it doesn't.
Everything is super broken but the enemies also scale so so hard that like you have to be broken.
I feel like that was that was the.
Fun of most Train 1 is that like more so than almost any other roguelike games, you can get truly broken builds and that was like that.
36:50
That was mainly the result too of like.
Just being able to like modify like specific cards or heroes and just put all the modifications on one dude and then just be able to abuse that sort of a thing.
I I really miss the DLC from the.
From not during one where you had like the weird like what?
37:07
I don't remember what the like bad points or you spent spent like purse points or something in the middle and to like make your cards like super better.
But then it made all the enemies harder and you like did that entering the run and then you had to that if you had enough, you fought the Super boss at the end.
37:23
Do you remember doing that, Scott?
I remember.
No, I don't.
I don't remember that.
At all?
Maybe I.
Didn't do the DLC I think I put I didn't.
Do the DLC.
Yeah, I didn't.
Do the DLC.
Either I do remember.
You talking about it though?
And I remember being like, oh that sounds interesting.
I actually really liked that DLCI.
Thought it, it added to the game in a way that felt like it was a true add.
37:44
It added a little bit of complexity, but also, yeah.
So here's the thing with.
So Monster Train 2 is getting a DLC called Destiny of the Rail Forged, which great name.
And I feel like maybe this maybe this is what Monster Train 2 should have been 'cause it's like, was it like it's like Monster train in space or you know, whatever kind of like ethereal equivalent it is.
38:10
And it's like a slightly different kind of like it's not like literally the exact same like rail, like choose your left, right rail system like from the first game.
It's like a different kind of mode of interaction with the play space.
38:26
They have like an FTL style map.
I feel like it's.
From screenshots that I've seen of it, it almost kind of looks like a simplified version of that in a way.
Artistically, it looks very interesting and they have these things called souls in it that maybe it's kind of like a similar sort of thing to like what you're talking about with monster training.
38:45
It is.
Is it really?
Going to come out in like 5 days is it?
Oh, did we time?
This podcast really terribly, I think we maybe.
Did.
Or maybe we timed it really well.
Because then people are going to be Googling for Monster Train DLC and they'll this, these guys did a podcast and they must really like it.
39:02
Oh boy, I can't wait to listen.
I can't tell now.
That this random Reddit post has been deleted.
So maybe that's not actually true.
I mean the yeah.
Like the the art for it looks really cool except all this device sometime.
39:17
In early February.
OK, well, we may maybe we were reviewing this like literally one podcast too early.
Well, yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
Like if.
If it does survive to to the wild card round of the Omega Bowl, because we all know Sleigh the Spire 2 is going to be taking that that coveted divisional spot for for deck builders.
39:42
So foregone conclusion at this point.
Can you?
Can you imagine if Slate Aspire 2 came out and was like, oh maybe Monster Train 2 is better?
Man, they would have to screw up.
Royally.
I mean, well, you've been.
Disappointed by sequels before but I I know.
I've heard, I've heard the lectures from the creators of the game.
39:59
They know what they're doing.
These are people that understand the mechanics.
I trust them to make a good game and they activated or they.
They added activated abilities, they added card equipment and and rooms to to slay the Spire 2 and Hearthstone art.
I mean they they already have activated.
40:16
Abilities.
They have potions, OK.
But yeah, so, so coming back to the turnstile for the DLC, that was really funny.
By the way, please clap.
I think the DLC for Monster Train 2 is maybe like that.
40:33
That's like the riskier version of like, oh, Monster Train 2 has like this cool, like new flavor to it.
Like Monster Train 1 is like, it's the same game.
It's the same game.
And the first game was totally fine.
But this is the same game.
And if you really like the first one, you'll really like this because it's the same game.
40:53
The DLC looks like, oh, this is, this is like something risky and different.
And I feel like because Inkbound flopped so hard that the developers were so risk averse that they were like, no, no, no, we, we have to stay with this tried and true formula.
41:09
Like don't, don't do like anything out of the realm.
That's like, gonna make Monster Train One fans mad.
Like, just bring Monster Train 1 back because people love it.
We'll add some more stuff to it.
Yeah.
Lame.
I'm I'm curious.
41:25
I'll, I'll almost certainly play this DLC then and at some point we can we'll we'll slip slip in a little like hey, Monster Train 2 is better now yeah I mean if.
If you're like guys, you got to play the DLC.
41:42
We were totally wrong.
We were totally off base by giving Monster Train 2 threes across the board here.
Yeah, I think like I'm I will be happily convinced by DLC 2.
I mean Monster Shame 2's been out for.
Almost a year now.
So that's true.
Yeah.
I feel like this It's it's.
41:57
Good timing DLC wise to like yeah like this game is not like wanting.
For shit.
In it I either like there's so much stuff in this game already that like, you know, you could you could put 900 hours in this game and not not really see everything.
So I just mean I'm looking, I'm just reading.
42:13
Through the the steam reviews, people fucking love this game right now even without stuff.
Yeah.
So.
I'll I may like this even more than Sleigh the Spire, actually.
OK, that's just heresy.
Who are these people?
Who are these people?
42:29
That's a bot.
Yeah.
To it's a paid bot.
Yeah, did like maybe coming back to the actual stuff that's in this game, who used the undo button religiously?
I never touched it other than me.
I mean I used it a couple.
42:45
Times when I literally clicked the wrong thing.
I don't think I ever used it as a like oh this whole turn went wrong.
It was like wait a second that's not what I meant to do.
I definitely used it on the boss.
Fights a lot because I was like, oh, all right, what's what's the best way to approach this?
43:03
And then like again, I'm very happy that monster train systems come back with like doing all the math for me so I don't have to get out the pen and paper and like, all right, is this sequence of moves gonna be the one that like does the most damage?
And there was a couple times where like, I, I did the thing and then I hit and turn.
43:20
I'm like, oh, no, I should have hit the undo or like, you know, I screwed up missing.
I forgot to hit the activated ability.
That's the one that actually bugged.
That was the only couple of times where I'm like, I wish I could do undo now because I was like, as as I'm watching my my guys die, I see like, oh, he had activated ability.
43:39
Oh, no, yeah.
And I do like that how like right next to the end turn button, it kind of it clusters all that stuff right next to it of like, you know, Oh, by the way, you still have some activated abilities to use if you want to use them.
I actually I I do like the the equipment cards kind of a lot because I think it does like there there was a lot of times where like I'm like, all right, I think I know how to set this build up, but then I would get actually like backing up like the the dimensional challenges.
44:09
So this is kind of like, wait, I don't I didn't play any of the dimension where where?
Are those no, So they're on the.
Main they're on like the main menu screen and they're like towards the upper left, I think.
And it's like they are non or like they're, they're all the same kind of like starting stuff.
44:34
So it's like you, you have like a set group of clans that you're working with and there's like there's some gimmick to it of like, oh, like the the very first one that you do, I believe is like all equipment have 0 cost to them or something like that.
And you start with like specific equipment cards that's kind of like set your build on like 11 path, but like maybe you could divert from it as the run progresses.
45:02
And I like that a lot.
Like I thought that like that that almost kind of felt like the tutorial system in a way of like, hey, here's the here's this neat toy.
Like it's on like a crazy discount.
Go and play with it.
I literally cannot find it.
I.
Feel like I'm an idiot now.
I mean, you, you beat the game.
45:19
Yeah, I did.
Or or maybe I haven't unlocked?
It yet you beat a run which I.
Guess is effectively beating the game now.
I think it should be It should be unlocked mentional challenges.
People love hearing me type and go through.
45:37
I mean, yeah, this is a great, great.
Listening, but it's like.
It, it kind of reminded me of Halls of Torment a little bit because it has like this little like, you know, like grid path that you can kind of like you beat this one and unlocks like a little adjacent next challenge thing that you can do.
45:56
And like, I thought that was interesting of like, oh, here's like a way to like teach you how to play the game and maybe some like some like restrictions.
So like the first one you do equipment cards cost 03 random ones added to your starting deck.
You get attack and health benefits from equipment are doubled and all cards have one fewer upgrade slot.
46:17
So so it's kind of like a little little bit of a balance there.
And that like that really kind of like forced me to be like, OK, I'm going to think really hard about this equipment system now.
And that drove me to victory for that.
And I felt like a Galaxy brained super champ.
Like, yeah, I was able to like put the swift blade on this guy.
46:35
And every time they changed positions, it gave them a permanent boost to their damage.
That felt really good.
I was your comment on.
I never did any.
Dimensional challenges.
I didn't realize that was a thing either.
Well, what I mean.
I liked the.
I definitely have not unlocked this.
Really.
I thought it just kind of like.
46:51
Unlocked as you played the game because it's like, it's definitely you have to, you have to.
Next feature unlock is 2 pirate hearts which I guess I haven't done yet.
OK, so so.
That's another thing I kind of wanted to talk about was like the progression, oh, you know what my problem is?
47:07
The second pirate heart that you unlock you get from losing life on your heart, and I just have played the game so good.
I haven't done that yet.
Oh, you're too pro.
That's the.
Problem I I've like.
Yes literally yes.
47:22
I've won more.
I've only lost the I've lost the first game and I've won the the next like 4 games that I've played.
Wow so sorry.
I'm too good.
Yeah, I guess.
Like.
The the little progression thing at the bottom where it says like, all right, you have like 6.
47:39
So the idea is that like you are playing through the game in order to unlock more stuff and then you have more stuff.
You beat the game and then you you up the challenge by by increasing at your covenant rank and you can see your your on your friends list, like who has the highest covenant rank?
47:59
You're like, well, I got to beat Will's covenant three level so that way I can gloat about.
It on the Scott you asked.
If Joe liked this game, I don't.
Know, but he has beaten it at Covenant 10, so he's at least played it a lot.
OK, that that that track.
So I, I'm, I'm going to have to play a lot more.
If I'm going to be the number one in my friends list, which I.
48:18
I do appreciate it.
I feel like that that's a good way to kind of like leaderboard against your friends for friendly competition.
But in that sense, it becomes more of like your friends are the final boss instead of the actual game mechanics having like this game doesn't have like a sleigh the Spire heart.
48:35
That's kind of like this emblematic Titanic boss fight.
That's just like that's the draw.
I feel like there's some, there's something missing with like the draw here of like beating something in Monster train doesn't feel cool to boast about.
But like if you, if you like, I was just at, at lunch today and like some people who were like, Oh yeah, I love playing Slay the Spire.
48:56
And you say like, well, I, I beat the heart on Slay the Spire, like even like on ascension, like 1 or 0 or whatever, that's going to be like, oh, that OK, cool.
Like that's like a cool thing.
Well, and like beating the heart on Slay the Spire.
Is interesting because you have to like, really set up your whole game for it, right?
49:13
Like you have to think in advance about like, oh, the mechanics are different for the fight.
I have to build a deck that's a suboptimal deck for the most of the game in order to make sure that I have an optimal deck for this fight at the end, which is a fun challenge versus, you know, like, I guess I could look at the I could look at what the final boss is gonna do ahead of time.
49:36
But like all the bosses feel a little bit samey.
Like I've not changed my like you can look at all the bosses ahead of time.
I'm not like felt the need to look ahead be like I need to build a whole strategy around this and it would be in order to to.
49:53
To fight off.
These archetypes, Yeah, like on the 1.
Hand I can appreciate knowing in advance everything that's coming up so that way you can kind of build and plan around it.
But again, this is will you were totally right.
This is why slate the spiders, the goat.
It like it tells you who like that act boss is, but it doesn't tell you what any of the elite fights coming up are.
50:13
And those could just like completely Shank your build if you're not taking into account something that could hard counter you.
And so like I'm looking through like the covenant ranks here for Monster train 2 and it's like covenant one, enemies are stronger.
Covenant 2 battles have more enemies, things cost more, you get stuff added to your deck.
50:30
Enemies are stronger.
Like none of these, none of these seem like OK, like, oh man, covenant 8 to 9, your pyre takes 30% damage at the start of the run.
Like, OK, if it was something that's like covenant 70, now you can't see what the bosses are.
50:46
It's like shit like that's that's a big deal.
I mean, I'm sure at some level of covenant.
It does start being like you really do have to look ahead and see what the bosses are because it's like, well, that's going to add 45 rage to everything.
So you have to.
But I mean most of the answer is do more damage, become more.
51:05
Broken do do do the stuff get more units to moan as they attack yeah moan louder yeah Covenant rank should just scale up the.
Moaning sound like this Covenant rank.
You're the 10th one.
They just double the volume.
51:22
Yeah, real life.
Psychic damage.
Well.
Yeah, I guess like the only other things that I have maybe about like the meta progression is like I I do like that it kind of forces you to engage with the systems maybe.
I don't know, it felt like it unlocked a little slow for me.
51:38
Yeah, I did feel like that unlocked for a little slow because.
Especially since it feels so much like the first game, right that I'm like.
Well, I could.
Just go back to play in.
The first game where I already have everything unlocked.
It's true.
Yeah, that's really the the.
51:54
Big problem here too, right with with Monster Train 2 is that like once you like Monster Train one, once you've beaten that, then the novelty of the train of the three of the three stacked of three levels and having like the, the train tracks and like the divergent reward system, the the Luke goblins, all those like actual improvements overslay the Spire.
52:15
Like, hey, you can actually see how much damage you're gonna do in advance.
That's an improvement.
And like these were all like cool and interesting.
And then like the yeah, this this, this is the, the second ones.
Just it.
That's why I have yeah, like I said, 6 1/2 hours or so into this one or however much it is, because it's just like I'm not playing the same game and you're talking about all these meta progression things that I just couldn't.
52:36
It didn't hook me enough in the beginning to like get me to go into the meta progression and care about any of this stuff 'cause I'm just like, it's the game I've already beaten.
I don't know, maybe I maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance here, but the art just like really pushed me away from it too much.
52:52
I mean, I'm I'm.
Open to the idea of like the DLC, like hooking me in, but yeah, like where I'm at with it right now and like it.
It's also like the curse of us doing a podcast specifically like where we look at new stuff and not like, hey, what if we just do like a whole podcast on just Slay the Spire?
53:11
I'm sure like we would get sick of it after episode 95.
We do.
We should do it in.
A a new podcast where we just the whole episode is just looking at each individual card we could.
We could save that for a Patreon for sure.
53:28
But but yeah, I kept thinking like it would Monster Train 2 be better if this game just had like an unlock all button and then I could just like fuck around with all the systems all at once.
But it feels like it's kind of gating you to like unlock stuff a little bit at a time.
Don't get too overwhelmed.
Which is fine story system.
53:47
A lot.
Because it's really good, Yeah.
I don't think I'm going to click on any other.
Story stuff you don't you don't want to hear.
Fel and Serif talk about because one day when you're the one sitting on that throne, you'll realize why I had to do the things that I did.
54:05
That one was fine.
It's the the one between the two Dragons was so bad.
Like like Diablo, like level of.
Writing, I mean a Diablo 3 and 4, Diablo 4 level of writing.
It's not even that because it's like.
54:21
At least with like Diablo it's like bad Reddit comic.
Like cringe writing.
I mean, I I felt like the actual.
Like text itself was like meh and like maybe kind of forgettable, but I feel like the implementation of it just felt super tacked on where it's like, 'cause like all all of the art assets in this game are just like copy pasted all over the place.
54:43
Possibly because like they couldn't do it otherwise otherwise the engine would fold in on itself.
And like, I mean, I'm not gonna let them.
I'm not.
Gonna let that slide like oh, the game that I built myself from scratch.
The engine is too bad to make it a good game is like I understand, but also that doesn't mean you get it to be a good game because you it was hard.
55:06
Well, what I'm what I'm getting at is like the card.
Art for Lord Phoenix, Phoenix Phoenix like the card.
Art for it like very cool, very bespoke.
You play the card, that exact same unit is out on the field, which OK, sure, but then like in dialogue sequences which it's.
55:25
It's also the same one, but it's like.
Maybe maybe there's like one or two other kind of like very like slight like frame adjustments to it.
And it's just like like they're, they're on like one side or the other.
And it's like the, the left side is like highlighted that person's talking.
55:41
And then like the dialogue box like fills in and it just has this kind of like, I don't know, I mean, I, I.
I you know what, as it even as we're saying this, I'm thinking like, I loved Hades too.
And they didn't, they had like it would be like the one picture and then be like one single other picture where they're like, oh, I'm surprised.
56:02
Yeah, yeah.
Like there's there's something.
It's just because I didn't like the writing and I didn't like the art style.
If I had liked the writing and the art style, the fact that they didn't move and they were the same art would have been fine with me.
Right.
Because like like.
Metal Gear codec scenes are famous for this where they're just like shitty little jpegs on like one person is like maybe their mouth is like moving 2 frames per second but it's so.
56:25
Like if this if.
Like the writing was just like so over the top and stupid.
Like maybe that would be funnier if it's just I, I don't know, like I Star Fox like do a barrel roll.
Like, you know, that kind of thing with like little faces yapping or something.
Cuz like, I mean.
I didn't play this game a a ton, but like I think part of the reason for that is there there wasn't like there wasn't like anything hooking me with it of like why should I care that we're fighting the Titans to save heaven and like I do not care about fighting the.
56:54
Titans, I do not care about the story making me engaging.
Feel like I'm being bad for not engaging with the story.
Is is worse.
I would prefer if there was just nothing and I should be hooked by the gameplay alone.
Yeah, and and there's plenty.
Enough of that to to go around for sure.
57:11
Yeah.
And I, and I think a lot of people.
The people who love this game and think it's the best game are not thinking that because of because of the story.
They're thinking it's because it's like it does legitimately have good gameplay elements.
I think we're probably going to give it.
57:27
If we had never played Monster Train One, I'm sure that we would be giving this game a higher score.
Absolutely, yeah.
Which is like a little bit of a shame.
I feel bad, like saying like it should be better or like I'm bored because I've already played this game, but but it is what it is.
57:44
It's like, yeah, when I got my.
List here.
I think, I think that's the the gist of it so far.
I mean, just monster training one DLC.
Yeah, we've said it 3 * 4 * 5 times.
I'm I'm looking forward to the.
58:00
Actual DLC, though, for this game, like, I still have pretty high hopes.
And I mean, as you'll see, like, I still gave it a pretty good rating.
Like, I feel a little bit weird, like we spent this whole episode basically trashing this game, but I think it's fundamentally a good game.
Yeah.
It's like it's it's in that.
Solid meaty middle curve of the of the ratings here.
58:20
And I feel like we're like we're being overly critical on it because we want it to be as different of an experience of like how Monster Train was to all the other stuff that we were playing at the time.
And Monster Train 1 is still like like the, the style, like Monster Train 2 is just Monster Train one but better.
58:36
But because it like we're playing it after, it's just more of the same in that regard.
And yeah, like you're 100% like if we had only played Monster Train 2, it would probably take that coveted #9 spot that we have.
But maybe, maybe we actually want to jump into the actual numerical rating process, yeah.
58:58
Before we do that, I want to just bring it back one more time to like the music's really good.
I know will doesn't listen to music, but this it it has excellent music.
I think the first monster train also had good music and this has probably even slightly better music and it's different, but it still feels like the same thing.
59:14
So I, I, I think they did like slam dunk on the music.
Yeah.
I mean when I was.
Playing it, I basically just turned all of like the in game sound effects all the way down and the music all the way up.
That's probably the correct way to play this game.
OK, now we can continue.
All right, Yeah.
59:31
Ranking numbers worst to 1st I guess will kick us off well.
Yeah, so with the Monster Train 1 here, I gave that one an 8 out of 10.
Solid game, really good.
That was my 16th favorite year.
59:47
It looks like a tied for it with many other ones, but Monster Train 2, I think it's just Yeah, it's the same Monster Train 1.
Interesting story, new, innovative, like you're at, you know, defending hell, how fucking cool is that?
This one that you you get this really long cinematic in the beginning describing this really contrived story of the Titan attack, and now you have to.
1:00:12
It just felt so.
Lame.
I didn't care about the new mechanics.
I hate the art.
I'm going to give this one a 6.5.
I still think it's a good mechanically good deck rogue like deck builder, but I just I can't give it any better than that I'll.
1:00:28
Go next.
For me it is a 7.7 kind of like in my big meaty chunk of the of the middle like middle good games.
Also tying the same score that I gave Hand to Fate to which I think is like it's probably the best corollary that I have for this for like hand to Fate two, kind of like push the mechanics of Hand to Fate one a little bit to be like, OK, this is like the better version to play.
1:00:52
Monster Train 2, I feel like kind of does that, but maybe not quite as much as I wanted it to.
So yeah, I mean, I gave Monster Train one maybe not that much higher of a rating of like a 7.9.
So, you know, it's still in the same, still in the same ballpark there criticism stuff for it.
1:01:12
I I feel like the art aesthetic is still not for me.
This is, you know, art aesthetic that is certainly for some people, but definitely not my jam.
And that that's great that it works for those people.
It's not for me.
The story segment things I thought were very bad, both in their like their implementation and just like just get out of the way.
1:01:32
I just want to play more Monster train.
Like this story stuff is just there's nothing here that's doing it for me.
The like the the sound effects where like and again, like you're here to play this game on like colossal turbo mode.
And when they're just going to all over the play, it's like I was playing on the couch and Amanda looked over at me and she's like, what the hell is that sound?
1:01:54
And I'm like, all right, Scott, should I be concerned?
Yeah.
What's going on in there?
It's a.
It's a.
Game for kids?
Don't worry about.
It I had to slide that sound effect all the way down.
Meta progression feels a little slow.
1:02:09
I don't know if that's like roughly the same as how it was in monster train one, but I don't know like, yeah, there's some something fell off about it and it felt maybe too safe for a sequel and maybe that's something the DLC will fix.
I'll be curious calling to get your your take on it and see if that'll suck me back in.
1:02:26
But I think the goods here, the music top notch.
Like they did not have to go so hard with the music for the monster train series as they did, but I definitely appreciate it.
They didn't they didn't drop the ball on trying something crazy and just like ruining the formula.
1:02:42
So that's good.
I do think the game still has like a very good like when when you're in it and you're playing it, it still has a very good like Oh man, I I got it.
I got to see how this turns going to resolve.
Am I going to win this fight and the the progression system of like making all the crazy broken build stuff is still fun and being confronted by the boss fight at the very end of like, oh, you think your build is broken, huh?
1:03:08
Let's put it to the test my hands.
I was 4000.
Life.
Yeah, like my.
Hands, my hands are getting sweaty.
I was getting a little pretty pumped up, like barely beating the boss fight at the end, like OK, that felt fun and good.
And then I put it down and maybe, maybe that was my off ramp for, for Monster Train 2, but I don't know.
1:03:28
I'm, I'm willing to be sucked right back in with the DLCI.
Think if if you're a big fan of Monster Train 1, you will like Monster Train 2 even more for all those reasons, yeah.
Are you wait, sorry, you you set your you've pulled into the depot Your your review is Yeah, we're we're terminus.
1:03:48
I'm, I'm unloading my my ratings passengers here with all my tortured train analogies 7.7 right next to like dead zone rogue blueprints.
I'm sorry.
And a hand of fate to among others.
1:04:05
You know, it's it's it's solid.
It's right in the meaty middle there.
Yeah, I'm.
Going to give a a 7.8 which is I think slightly higher on my distribution than non Scott.
So it's 2021 out of 87 games we've played, so still pretty high, well in advance of the like peak of the bell curve.
1:04:25
I mean, I think you guys have both said a lot of the points that I I would have said.
I think that they needed to have changed something more like even if it was just the same game but with better graphics, that probably would have been a better impression on me.
1:04:41
It feels like it's the same game, just just the same game with a couple of extra things.
So I'm I'm looking forward to the DLCI think it probably like I played the monster monster train one with the DLC.
So I've already played a an expanded version of that game.
1:05:02
I know that there's definitely games out there where playing the base game without any of the DLC is not like playing the full game.
You know, it takes a little bit more for it to bake.
All of the Paradox games are like, don't play them until at least three DLCS have come out.
I wonder if Monster Train 2 will end up being like hey don't play this game unless you bought the DLC, just go back to play monstering one.
1:05:26
I think that a lot of the stuff they added was maybe neutral.
It was like pretty good in isolation.
It does add a little bit more like complexity for better and for worse.
You still get the broken builds, you still get a little bit of that.
1:05:43
Like you'll either win fast or you lose fast, which is good in a lot of ways.
I mean, comparing that to like caves of Cud where like there is no like 30 hours in and we and we we died like no, a monster train run is what, 45 minutes an hour like and and if you're behind the curve, you'll find out fast and your run will be shorter.
1:06:10
So, like, there's reason that I I I gave the first Monster Train a 9.5, and I think that probably this game actually does deserve even better than a 7.8, But because the first Monster Train exists, I can't give it a higher score than that, at least until the DLC comes out.
1:06:25
So maybe we'll revisit later this year.
There you go.
Yeah, I mean like for how?
Critical.
We've been like, it's not that like Monster Train 2 is bad, like our aggregate rankings.
Drop it here on the 35th slot out of 87 games that we played in total.
So that that's pretty good, right?
1:06:41
I mean, it's no Realm of the Mad God or hack slash loot.
So it it doesn't have to worry about that as much.
But yeah, I think it's yeah, there's I'll be curious to see if they do it like more than just one DLC, 'cause I think Monster Train one also just had one DLC to it as well.
1:06:59
But I think so, yeah.
They'll they'll come back, they'll add.
They'll come out with Inkbound 2 and it'll be all the stuff that like, oh man, so glad they they did all this stuff.
But but yeah, so real quick, some similar games to Monster Train 2, like we've we've done a lot of other deck builder game episodes.
1:07:18
As you can see our previous episode of Monster train one, but someones that we haven't talked about, we talked a lot about the Hearthstone aesthetic.
There's actually some like Hearthstone roguish modes in the game.
There's something called I'm going to butcher this, but it's like Rastacans Rastacons rumble or battlegrounds mode from what I can tell.
1:07:40
Might be up your boat or train analogy.
Something for for people who like the the art here.
There's another auto battler.
It's more of like an inventory management game called backpack battles, which could be interesting.
1:08:00
I've I've dabbled a little bit with it.
I've played a little bit more of super auto pets, to be honest, But backpack battles is kind of like this.
It's a similar kind of like deck building auto baddler game.
And one that's maybe more up Collins Alley is a game called Rogue Voltage where you're kind of like putting together, how do I describe this?
1:08:18
You're putting you're like wiring together like logic grids as as you I'm still talking on backpack battles.
Rogue Voltage another one to check out across the obelisk I think and Vault of the void have been compared to similar ones to monster as like monster train style gameplay.
1:08:37
One that I was dabbling with a little bit before Christmas during steam sales.
Starvaders, which people were going ape shit about in 2025.
A definite stay tuned.
That one for sure is very interesting and one that's like also very interesting for different reasons.
1:08:55
Ring of Pain is what if like dark, like dark fantasy style aesthetic, maybe some allusions to addiction and things like that.
And like the the cards themselves are a dungeon question mark.
1:09:11
I'll leave it at that, but but yeah, check, check out some of those.
As we wind down here, I'll plug our e-mail grogpodzone@gmail.com, which I have a very quick listener letter here.
It shouldn't take more than 60 seconds, but it's from David Nguyen, who's written it a few times before, who says hi.
1:09:32
Grogpod writing in again to say huge Congrats on a successful third season.
Just finished listening to the Omega Bowl.
Even though I didn't play many of the games mentioned, I still listened.
I so enjoyed listening to it, to the genuine chemistry and self-described quote bickering between the Co hosts.
1:09:50
I was also really happy to hear that your.
Listenership is growing.
You guys should start a Patreon exclamation mark.
I'd be down to financially support the podcast on Patreon even if you don't provide any exclusive benefits on it from David there.
So thank you, David, for writing in.
I'm conflicted about Patreon stuff because it's like, oh man, it feels like we actually have to like, try now.
1:10:10
Yeah, I'm actively guessed having a.
Patreon because it would make me feel bad about not playing this game for more than 8 hours.
I agree.
But.
Yeah, we we'd give it away out of the.
Goodness of our hearts, it's a it's.
A free service, much like the free service that I provide on our Mastodon at the Grogpod at game dev dot place where sometimes some of the the wacky screenshots and things that we do in our discord show up on there when when appropriate.
1:10:38
Nothing, nothing, no, no doxing involved.
We'll put it that way.
And then our website Grogpod dot zone has all the all the stuff on there.
You want your one stop shop to to send all of your friends to go there.
They can find all the stuff there.
Grogpod dot zone our next episode.
1:10:55
Hey, Andrew, what's our next episode?
Dead air.
He is out of vacation.
I think he's probably out at the 70,000 tons of metal cruise event again 'cause that's happening this week which.
Is which is very apropos.
1:11:10
Because Andrew's pick is definitely putting his FPS meathead pedal to the metal.
METAL.
With Roboquest, the first person shooter robot game, you are a robot.
You're going, you're shooting that.
1:11:27
That's all that you need to know.
That's your one sentence.
Description.
That's the one sentence description we.
Covered one of the tracks for it in last year's music fest episode.
It was the, it was one of the really heavy metal tracks that we covered.
1:11:43
It's it's got a, a great soundtrack to it.
We're we're following up a great soundtrack game with another great soundtrack game.
Yeah, I don't know about this one I'm looking at.
These screenshots the the game plays very fun like I.
Think for some of the stuff that we were maybe knocking dead zone Rogue with, I think Roboquest is like people hold it up with like very highest, right, Right, yes, I remember.
1:12:05
This game, Yeah, I remember talking about it, yeah.
That'll.
Be.
That'll be our next episode, but to play us out from this one, I think we've all come to the conclusion that the that Monster Train 2 is as kind of A2 sided beast with a with with twos everywhere.
So why not have a A2 motif theme that sounds right out of something like a haunted baseball stadium?
