thank you

[Music] greetings all and welcome to A Whole New Year of the going rogue gaming podcast can you believe it we've done this podcast for two years now aren't incredible we're podcast veterans we are or indomitable just yeah just keep getting all this great content out there into the world really that's that's the way that we should do it is just start any like major thing on December 31st and then the next instance of we've been doing this for two years we're experts at it already I feel like you do have to be more specifically you do have to say I've been doing this in two years and then they're like wait what over the span of two years over the spit perfect yes oh and even better starting it at the at the end and starting of a decade so you can say oh yeah I've been doing this like over the course of a decade yes yes really really milk it uh well thank you for joining us in year two of grogpod uh I I am your uh uh

I'm trying to go into a very distinct British accent and then it kind of fell apart there after a second but I'm I'm Central Command of the podcast Scott burger and I'm joined with my two agents who have gone Rogue

oh I forgot all our names this is like a week ago uh cyborg man thing with its really low voice and he's all deadly and super serious about killing things I could be the AI

that's your AI voice

well this is incredible well that's the thing with DND voices is like all of zebelia whatever her name is international no that's an agent you fool did you even play this game did you even rack up as many hard-cutting hours as Colin and I did here yeah the two experts uh we're we're here to talk about uh invisible ink uh released developed and published by Clay entertainment you might know them from other games they've developed of note Mark of the Ninja a very high quality game I recommend checking that one out uh and several uh stay tuned in a half of Crypt of the nepro dancer Don't Starve and recently released grifflands all all on our uh to-do list at some point Don't Starve yeah yeah I mean on my list but like Don't Starve is another like that's uh I didn't realize they were connected well this is where again like people will write in with hate mail uh about oh yeah is this game you know roguelike yes or no uh but because of the intentionally uh crazy wide uh trolling net that we've thrown overboard uh gems like Don't Starve are going to going to get caught up in that net so uh keep an eye out for for those coming down the pipe uh as I feel like Don't Starve is a pretty rogue-like game you definitely do runs of it you definitely have actually it's a rope lights game fine actually it's a deck builder now um invisible ink released May 12 2015. uh you can find it on Steam Mac Linux PS4 and iPad and this cranks in at uh the 130th most uh popular roguelike that we have in our data set at 5183 total reviews cranking it at the 96th percentile will what's a one sentence description of what one does in this game you only have one sentence to write out before the guards are about to capture you what are you going to send to Central Command about the description here I'm going to say it's a tactics based game that looks a lot like x-com but with one-fifth the content and some new ideas

that sounds a lot shorter and it's a lot shorter so it is intended to be played more than once you're not wrong in that it's it's very x-coming but the key distinction here is that a you're not killing aliens and B I feel like this game really puts you more into a non-killing attitude right out the gate well maybe you

I think I only killed one person in my entire playthrough hmm I didn't even have a lethal I never even had a Lethal Weapon I just had the the auto turrets kill a guy once but I mean I only played it on on easy mode so maybe maybe that becomes less viable as you uh progress through the difficulties and whatnot you write those guys like in general like yeah uh killing was highly like you were punished for doing that and so trying to just knock people out or avoid them was generally what the game wanted you to do well this is this game is super interesting because I've played I've played I don't know it's 20 20 hours is not a lot of XCOM but I think that's how much I've put yeah I know your expression is of disgust there but uh I I have I've put so that's how much time I put into XCOM I'll just be upfront and blunt about it uh possibly also another stay tuned if this game makes it on the list uh but like the the difference here I think is that it's much more stealth Focus the the theme Here is much more Noir a lot more like hacking uh like Espionage um and and yeah I think that like there's there's definite parallels that we'll get into but yeah um X call me by which we meet the you know for the 10 people who are listening to this I've never played XCOM before it's a turn-based uh Squad based game that you are sending your your units out into the field to go about and secure some objective and we have multiple of these kinds of different objectives here in invisible ink um but once you have that objective cleared then you got to get back you gotta get back home uh I think that's the case with XCOM are you go do you always have to get back to your ship no no XCOM is way more varied in that regard and it's not and there's like interior exterior emissions there's different aliens there's random events that happen it's much more yeah like that's that's what I say like a lot more content in general yeah yeah there's a lot there's a lot more content but I do feel like XCOM has a more limited scope in how you achieve those aims like it's figure out all the different ways you could murder the aliens or yeah you'd have to kill them all yeah yeah versus this I felt like maybe it's not that it actually maybe invisible doesn't actually have that many more options on how you achieve your mission but it's definitely a different way to achieve it than XCOM like I I feel like this is not an x-com clone in any way what it's a very similar game in terms of like it uses like a tactics style uh approach but you've got the way that they do engagements with people like your goal is never to be seen versus something like x-com I mean sure not being seen is a good thing but then it's to like pop out and kill them all as fast as you can uh I feel like just the way you move around the map is a lot more it felt more like a little chess puzzle or a like a like a movement puzzle than something like like x-com what about the Overworld though the Overworld is almost a carbon copy Oh you mean like so so yeah I guess a little bit a little bit about this game um invisible ink you first boot it up I think this game has a really great intro sequence and like a very good it doesn't have like an explicitly uh um buried away like click here for tutorial menu like your first quote-unquote mission in the game is the tutorial like Okay Age and it's it's couched very uh very much in the theme of the game which I like a lot where it's like okay agent uh you know our our Central Command has been compromised we need to get you out of there in order to get you out of there you have to right click over here to get to the door and then open the door uh right yeah which I'm I'm glad that like it kind of spells it out all for me because I'm like okay like I've it's been a while since I played next com game um I like that they're kind of showing me what all the buttons do and explaining it but doing so you know very much within the theme of the game and you know that like oh my God clock it you know the clock is ticking we're gonna get our agent out of there and like okay now I know what what like the incentive and you know what the what the call to action is um and it really gives you a nice little picture of like okay this is the package of each little mission that you're gonna do and it's obviously very stripped down but but this is like the overall stuff of it um and you start with with your uh your Blade Runner reference character uh Decker uh with the trench coat and Trilby which uh is I think he's super fascinating as a stealth stealth thing to start with um but you unlock more characters as as you go about and like will was saying you know you go through this tutorial Mission you get some story dump stuff which is very very good informatic um and you come to like this world world select screen that just kind of looks like you know the the over well it's a Mercator Projection of a globe you know it's a flat 2D here's all the countries um and the story is your Central Command has been overrun uh I guess we're supposed to be like an MI6 type deal uh and we are or maybe even like uh impossible the impossible mission Force I feel like we're like Isis the Isis from uh oh what's the show Archer like our own weird independent Secret Agency but I guess more confident than them but uh yeah like our own weird side force in a world ruled by corporations so all all the corpos infiltrated the true MI6 and we're like the the rebel infiltrator Secret Agency it was like 20 20 76 or 2074 I think was like the you know 2077 cyber cyber infiltrator yeah I mean they have teleporters and cybernetic stuff and yeah yeah I think the theme Here is is pretty dope I think like the way that the developers I I heard them once describing it was like if um if like the Noir era from like the 60s like kept evolving into like the 2070s era I'm like okay that's like that's like a good way to put it and I can almost see like fashion trends like in the 2070s like the the 60s Noir stuff coming back into fashion with big trench coats uh but yeah like you come to this this Overworld map screen and that's basically like your your mission select menu and you have a bunch of these different kind of missions that you want to do and that's your your sort of like um we're coming back to XCOM but you know your x-com guide of like okay I want to go from South Africa over to uh the Middle East and do this Mission over here um but the major story Hook is that your your AI that you have rescued from your home base uh is running out of power and you gotta you gotta go and get more power for it and you're you know running out of time you have a ticking clock to do all these missions and rescue your Rogue agents and stuff um before the before the corpos get you um I haven't made it super far through the story myself so I don't know for sure where where it's quite going but where I've gotten so far is three hours how many hours through are you in the the in-game clock oh in game clock uh 72 hours when you start I think I've I think I've gotten like 48 hours or so through okay but like actual Play Time three days I think you get three days is that right yeah and this is a non-spoiler but that clock doesn't matter at all yeah like that clock like it's just eight missions basically and like so the fact that they have the clock taking down there is just purely a gimmick and I'm not sure like that's not true you can get more missions than you than eight

there's a time there's a time between different spaces and it I mean but like so like on app like it makes very little difference because every single time it like it generates like essentially like the same sort of distances away from you you're not gonna find a tight cluster of like enough missions that would like significantly change so maybe it's not eight exactly maybe it's like seven to nine or something like that but it's like a person yeah the timer doesn't really matter I'm curious I didn't actually test this but if you just sat there and let it tick down does it actually just go to nothing and you like and it just like pulls you into the end game without like you having done anything I mean that just makes you lose like that would be the correct like this isn't that kind of game you just lose yeah I'm sure someone tested that um I'll look it up here while we're while you're talking here just turns into Idol game um yeah like uh so from this this main menu screen you have a bunch of different missions that you can select from going and and I think these determine the type of um like ultimate thing that you're hunting for in um your main mission mode uh so you have things like going and finding new weapons or going and finding new like cybernetic augmentations or unlocking new uh agents to to swap out from um I think like yeah so you you select one of those and then you get some story beats here and there from your Central Command uh Mission Handler and you know your your arms dealer guide chips in every every once in a while with some witty quips but it eventually teleports you into this randomly generated um zone of Office Buildings I guess is the way to put it uh that have all sorts of things with guards patrolling and uh patrolling robots and security cameras and listening devices and all this good stuff in there to really kind of keep you on your toes and so your ultimate goal is like okay you know I've I've teleported in here with two or three or four agents or so um I need to puzzle my way through this uh randomly generated floor of an office building uh to get to my mission objective and then figure out where the the exit teleporter is and beam out ideally without letting any of your agents die but I don't think I this is another time where I've been playing the game on like incredibly easy mode and I'm not sure if that's been to my benefit or if like if the real game is like you know you have to experience it on like normal or hard difficulty but this like I've been pretty impressed with how strategically deep the game has been even on like super Noob easy uh difficulty mode

yeah I thought it was oh uh yeah the beginner is the way to start because like there's a lot of like Nuance to like that you have to learn before you're able to do the higher levels which is like things that they don't teach you in the tutorial which is like if you're if you're someone that spots you you need to know that you're able to step in certain directions and just walk out of it versus like walking into a you know inside their vision and getting shot and there's like Nuance to like when and when you cannot do that and so and like yeah when can you actually hide behind something because it looks like you're standing in plain view but because it's got that symbol there you're actually hidden and that was like the oh okay that didn't really line up with my expectations but now I know and I can abuse that mechanic and so in beginner mode you learn all that stuff and then you I think you should just jump to like the expert mode which is how it's meant to be played beginner mode gives you a little bit of flexibility in terms of like rewinding a turn which I found very useful for there were a couple of times where I didn't I I like two or three turns in a row did a move and then put myself in a spot and like for some other reason it didn't work the way I expected it to and it's not like I was like oh you it was a move I didn't see it's like oh no he's standing on since he's standing on his body he can't use like painting his body down but he can't use his gun at the same time it's like well I don't care as much about the it's like I I want it to interact in a different way it's like you can't close the door because something's in the way or something like that um or uh I forgot so so many times that they can't move through other people deeply frustrating to me that would be like oh God that's in my list of things you ended your turn on the Square that's the door and now I have to rewind the whole freaking turn because I did that first and every other person can't like I think I guess it'd be hard but it would have been nice if there was something that was like can can you redo like a single space of movement just like the undo button for for just the one unit right right or just like maybe if they had some sort of way of uh telling like oh nothing serious had happened that mattered uh like I said I understand it was like oh you can't undo movement for one unit if they died but it's like oh no they just moved into the door dumb and I couldn't get my other people through I agree that would have been that would have been nice because there were there were several times where there's just some frustrating little mechanic where you're like oh oh and now I have to you know waste another turn here because there's or like or get spotted and like have someone down as a result but just as a quick note um I did find the answer here um the devs are saying that as for the clock leaving the game running at the map uh screen won't advance your game the clock ticking down is for show I don't know I know exactly just like that

my hunch is that if you actually do let it take down to zero it will just sit at zero and then you'll pick a a game a mission and then you'll come back and then it'll just Advance it by some set amount and send it to the next Point yeah well I mean this one's gonna be pretty high on my list but now it's done that's like two or three spot strap there yeah uh uh but yeah no I was glad that I did it uh I I think that yeah playing out of the easy mode was a good starter thing uh uh next time I play it I'll definitely play it on expert mode um but I I will say that so I did I did beat it the one time through on beginner mode and I was like cool I'm ready to unlock the new content I'm ready to go on to the next mission thing and I am a little disappointed that there's just the one campaign um well there's an endless mode too right yeah but there's no extra story for it uh and like there's not that much story content in there I don't feel like it would be particularly difficult to just be like oh cool we did this thing um now let's I mean if you wanted to like go back in time and be like oh let's play through some of the other hijinks that we've gotten into on various other times like even if it was just like very light fluff content to do something else would have been nice trying to then go through and do like you're doing the exact same Mission again and it or campaign yeah Etc yeah exactly all the missions are procedurally generated but yeah the campaign you're doing the missions again and the missions are are fine procedurally generating those absolutely no problem whatsoever uh like they're not particularly different from each other but they're at least different enough that you can't like memorize the level layout stuff like that uh but just having like new fluff dialogue as you're flying your your Mothership between the different points and having an end point being like cool we got this one bad guy like you could do like fluff I don't see the fluff stuff I it doesn't I want there to be a real game mechanic associated with that which is to say like like to just compare it to x-com again which I said like granted you know if the game is meant to be played in 20 hours and you're done with it that's fine but like uh they had the mechanic where like you're building a base too like and you have to assign resources to your base and at some point like there's a you know this big epic or you know I don't actually I won't give away too much but like you know you're trying to build some kind of a a spacecraft to like intercept and you get if you can put more resources into it or fewer and that determines the outcome of several like big things that are are happening and so those are felt like meaningful decisions whereas there's no meaningful decision at all in the actual selection of the um of where you're going because everything converts to credits like if you're gonna go like get some loot oh yeah you can convert that to credits or like you're going to use or you can go to another place to just get credits to buy loot or to like it's just like everything is so yep you go eligible right yeah you go in you smash you grab and you get out for eight missions and that's and like and they give it the very flowery inconsequential sort of like details and and you're saying you want more of that I'm saying I could do with less of that oh no so what I'm saying I mean I what I'm saying is basically I want a different final mission I want there to be three different mini campaigns where you could have the eight missions that you're leading up to each one those could be the same and at the end it's like well the first one you fight the uh you know you fight the AI and the second one you fight the uh the Crime Boss and the third third one you fight the uh the corrupt corpo president or something and it's there's just a slightly different objective in each one and it doesn't even really need to be particularly different but it definitely realizing that playing The Campaign on Expert would be literally playing the same campaign did make me five percent less excited on playing it again like even if it was like where yeah it's going to be the same thing it's going to have no like it's going to be the most Bland story fine at least it's a different Bland story and I don't think it would have been that much effort to make another one make a new like story you mean yeah yeah like if it's a you know you get a couple voice lines acted you swap around the rooms you color swap them or something like it doesn't really need to be that different I think I think as an example of that just to like take it to like maybe it like a an actual game mechanic that where it's a meaningful decision like what you're talking about it'd be like for instance let's say you choose a mission where you're trying to go in and like you know that's the executive and you're trying to steal his Intel or whatever well let's say you kidnap the executive and maybe he says he offers you a deal to like betray and so now you can go down to betray route where you're like you're a mole we're like pretending to work for them giving him intelligence and like I don't know like something where there's like of course like what's the end game like why would you ever actually want to do that but like in Fallout why would you ever want to blow up that main city I don't know what some people just do right so it's just like yeah give me like some kind of like big decision to like fundamentally change the outcome like that would be that'd be cool this game is really a a Showcase in a vehicle for its stealth mechanics yeah which is totally fine and I think the stealth mechanics here are really good but it feels like it's kind of missing something for me where like and granted I mean obviously I haven't beaten the game uh I'm I don't know I guess I would maybe Hazard on like two-thirds of the way through it on easy mode so I don't know if I can really make a a sound conclusion here but like I was like one of the first things that pops up you know when you're uh starting up the game is you know the tagline for this is tactical Espionage one word short of technical Espionage action from Metal Gear Solid if anyone caught that uh and I was like very much getting a metal gear solid feel for this game of there's guards walking around I gotta avoid them getting into a fight you can fight your way out that's not the ideal solution you really want to stealth your way around but I feel like I was missing some some tools to to get around the guards missing like um you see this in stealth games all over now and I don't know how common this was at the time but like let me like throw something to distract the guard or make like a sound so that way they can go what was that and distract them away from a certain area so I can move another agent in another area yeah you didn't play enough then because they were yeah okay okay um but yeah those were not good options by the way the best options are always more weapons essentially and more action points and you always went well you went with like a pure violence route right I I was driven to it because it was like obviously the best because when you once you down someone you can steal from them and those credits are just free credits and like if you down someone you're not penalized and if you kill someone then there's a cleanup costs at the end so you actually lose credits for killing but like yeah if you down someone there's no penalty except for increase in Threat Level and if you're good enough like Threat Level doesn't really matter like I ended most of my Missions at either the maximum throw at level or nearly maximum and my guys were just like you have enough guns or enough like stun guns you just go zap zap run over here and zap zap it's just like invisible now and then you just run through everyone and get out and you're just like I just stole all your stuff down to everyone and like that's the best way to play to get maximized credits to it's kind of like this a power curve that you can just get ahead of yeah I do wish there's a little bit more

I I feel like there are other ways that you could play that um I wish that the other ways were rewarded more um like so Scott you were saying tactical Espionage I do not feel like there was there was plenty of tactics but not that much Espionage yeah maybe that's like there was a lot of sneaking yeah I don't feel like we didn't plant anything like that would have been really cool it was a mission where you have to get in and like replace something yeah we probably would have played out the same way in terms of like what you're actually doing but it's like oh uh maybe at the end of that mission how effective your plant was would depend on how unnoticed you were so the goal would be to get through the entirety of the level without Downing a single guard and then every guard you down or did something to or Threat Level that you Advanced it that would decrease the effectiveness of the things that you planted something that would reward the true stealth approach rather than the like moderate stealth like don't get don't have the guards see that you've downed their friends kind of I think we need to explain for listeners too that like this whole like Threat Level thing that we're talking about is like as a game mechanic where it just like increases linearly per turn you like increase like slowly goes up and as it uh passes thresholds I think it's like once every life few turns or something it like has a major increase where more cameras will turn on or more enemies will enter or they'll take different routes and so it's supposed to get harder and harder but right and so one of the big side mechanics is you have up to four agents and then you have your AI that's kind of hovering over you and they get basically like Mana points to to do hacking protocols and and part of the the difficulty of the increased threat is that it makes all the hacking stuff more difficult so if you get behind that curve it can start being like a the only time that I almost like failed a mission was I tripped a bunch of stuff that made all the hacking costs way higher and then couldn't unhack them because it was like direct also draining my my power to hack stuff and so I I basically failed that mission I got all my people out but I did not complete the objective and I did not get any money for it but luckily since I'm playing on easy mode none of my people died and none of my I I didn't actually need that money desperately to survive but I feel like there is there's a a missing link here between like this game's like superb stealth mechanics uh the the and I I know the answer to this is no but uh neither of you guys have played the game hacknet before have you uh I haven't but I know what it is a long time ago though yeah um like more more sort of like um in-depth cyber Punky hacking mechanics from that because like hacking in this game is literally just hit the space bar to go to your AI and then you click the button on the security camera no and I have played I have played hack not you convinced me to play it for a little while I didn't get very far but yeah uh but you know something like something maybe just a step more involved than like click on security camera to hack it like it's very accessible it makes a lot of intuitive sense but and again like I don't know if this is something that crops up later in the game but like give me like a little mini game puzzle that I have to like maneuver a thing through and then like oh if I if I if the Little Dot like accidentally touches the wall you know the alarm goes off or something like you're shaking your head no well that gets all really fast with how many cameras in there like in Fallout 4 or like Fallout zeros like that kind of works because you don't you're not coming across a terminal every like you know 10 times in a mission but in this one it's like you're hacking everything like almost everything and so that that mechanic would probably get stale pretty quick yeah which yeah you you're right about that but like more more options for things than I've encountered thus far in terms of like are there any like Metal Gear Solid style cardboard boxes that I can hide in or like like porno mags I can put down to distract the guards like weird things like that that's a great mechanic [Music] uh there's yeah there's a number of different items in the in the game um but they're all yeah and they're definitely tears as you'll like you know you'll play around with all of them and uh some of them are much much better than others um but yeah nothing quite like like putting things on doors for instance especially once it gets upgraded like there's something that requires your dude to have a super high hacking level but if you have that and you put a like this kind of like I.E or IED kind of uh you know like it just like Downs a whole you can down like this one of the only AOE things in the game squares away from the door yeah and so if you can cluster everyone up and have them I'll chase the one person oh you just it's easy mode yeah

I mean all of this just feels like we should put probably uh bump uh Cog mind up on our list so that we can do some real hacking I mean yeah there's there's other games that that do stealth there's other games that do hacking actually I think this like the other clay entertainment game that they developed I think it came out before this Mark of the Ninja such that's just like an amazingly good stealth game that I think has maybe a little bit more story hook to it and I think that's that's kind of what I'm missing here is like you know what what does it mean to have different agents running around what does it mean that like oh you know I've I've unlocked you know this this thing like how does that change story elements in the main game like if I go and like I augment some dude up to the Max and he's just base effectively like a cyborg you know does that make him more vulnerable to the to the corporate guys that are hunting us or what yeah we get counter hacked yeah like it it seems like sterile is is too harsh of a word but it feels that there's it's it's like missing some kind of extra element of like okay like I have like Decker and international running around through this uh like cyberpunk office uh office building like okay like what what does it mean that I'm doing that and it might be fine that it's just like yeah we're just running in having a good time hacking some corporate safes and stealing their creds and zapping out uh but like where I'm at in the game right now I'm I'm kind of struggling to see like okay well like what am I gearing up for like what's what's sort of the insulate you have to power the AI That's unplugged and you're in the objective for over the eight or seven to nine missions or whatever it is like is to get enough resources so that you can win the final battle and that's essentially all there is to it there's no this is no Metal Gear solo there isn't there are big twists and turns and interesting like uh uh moments no it's just like a pretty straightforward that's what you're doing and like I think it's fine if a game wants to be simple like you know just like the pineapple game that was good oh it's not okay if it's that simple I'm afraid all right all right well I have a question I have a real question for you uh so you as the one who's played this game the most uh are there different builds that you can have for not not for a single person but those are different like builds for a team yeah and that's very much like there's a lot of synergies between the um hacking protocols that you get and um and your team builds and I tried um a couple of different ones I actually found that like for the most part like uh it doesn't really matter so long as you have at least one person focused on like getting energy and I think International I know they say that she's the bass like but way overpowered and that's like the character you get at the beginning and it's just like yeah she was extraordinarily good she can text through walls yes things through walls is just like nothing beats that because it's just something through walls and then I had her I had her fully upgraded and then had something else that if she was touching the terminal instead of Mind hacking it from far away like uh there were times I'll be like oh it is worth it for me to just literally not have her doing anything else but running around trying to hack these things because she can get nine Mana points for packing this thing versus everyone else gets one so and that's pretty much the strong like unless you and yeah unless you choose some like hacking protocols which uh downplay the need to have really like regenerative um like power like then you can choose some other characters but I think overall like it's yeah just kind of following the meta of like one really good hacker one really good offense person that has lots of AP and can like attack maybe even multiple times per turn um it doesn't matter like which one of the several people that are kind of teched out to do that but I didn't really like the ones that like were specialized in The Killing because ammunition is like ridiculously expensive in this game reverse is like just the stun just recharges itself and so if you can just not shoot people which is you get penalized for anyways it just seemed like that's just like a net negative that's a if you suck at the game and you actually just you're constantly having someone Point their gun at you and you don't know how to get out of it then yeah shooting them back is a way to do it but just be better I mean that's the better strategy yeah I did find it frustrating that like you know by no fault of the game more user error on my part I would get boxed into a certain situation and like okay I'm spotted now and my only like the only way that I can get out of it is to just like shoot the dude or die uh because you know if you're spotted you're basically pinned down and if you try to run they'll take like an opportunity attack against you uh but like yeah I don't know okay here's a question that I never actually encountered like but what happens if you Advance the turn and they can see you and you don't move do they just shoot you anyway yep oh okay so it's it's basically you just have one turn and they either shoot you if you move where they shoot you if you if it gets back to their turn but the meta is to just have one Med gel like you like eventually just having one as a backup is pretty much always a good idea and that's what you use to revive people right yeah exactly and everyone only has one hit point so you get revived back to full health yeah but like I mean like if you if you can just try and keep all of your characters within one movement that way if someone is spotted there's a chance you can come around and like hit him from another angle and uh obviously just like thinking about it in advance is the best strategy because then you won't get surprised like that are you saying the optimal play is to not stun every guard and have like carry them throughout the level to the mission objective and then drop them and run away as fast as you can well you're at maximum alert by the time you do that yeah you should get more points if you drag the the dead body or the excuse me stunned bodies to the teleporter and teleport them back to your main thing and hold them there you go it's a very metal gear solid five kind of I did uh on the last mission uh uh of my the first playthrough I did I I left a guy um so you can uh pin you pin which basically like they when you knock someone out you knock them out for three turns and if you have someone standing on that body it pins them which stops that count from going down which is weird like from a like a practical point of view yeah I don't know you're like putting them in a Chokehold or something I don't know um but uh I did it I I left a guy there to pin my guard and then I forgot about it until when the rest of my team were like four moves away and he had to run across the whole map and I just had to hope that there weren't guards that had spawned or moving around uh and uh yeah he made it but it was a close thing and turns out uh I was extraordinarily overpowered by that point because I am moderately good at tactical video games and I was on easy mode and by that point I had learned the mechanisms and I don't yeah I was just like well I thought I was good at tactical video games and then I was hitting that rewind button like almost every other turn because like my two Zippy guys would just like run all the way across the other side of the map and then like my one super slow guy would be like left behind and he'd be on basically by Body Disposal Duty and then like have either of you run into a situation again this is most likely user error on my part but like you're running through a level and for the life of you you just can't seem to find that level one Security card no matter how many guards you knock out and try to find out there's a scenario or his requirement so you say you don't need it the mission that I'm I'm not stuck on but uh I am still puzzling my way through is like the whole level is is very long and like the exit is on like one side and there's just like a big long J of a path that goes to this blocked door and I must have downed like two or three guards to get to that point and they were all pinned I'm like okay great uh where the hell's that security card uh where is the security card um um um and it's just like the one red door that's blocking me or maybe not a j maybe like a humongous you where like the exits on the other side of that door or I could run like the entire length of the level all the way around and back because the guy who actually has the security card is like deeper down into the level that I didn't know like that I thought was was a little frustrating but again you know people who beat this game on like super expert plus plus mode or like well obviously you're not supposed to do that that well I mean that's the nature of the procedural in general like sometimes you just have a [ __ ] role like I just I saw someone posting for like a valheim uh like thing today where they start spawn on the island with no trees and so they just like that had to do a restart and just like yep that's just uh bad luck sometimes and for the most part like the level generation in this game is pretty good like I think I can only count like one or two times like that time and maybe like one other time where I was like like boxed in again like basically painted myself into a corner where oh no now like the guards are coming out and they're just like Downing my my heroes one by one and I'm like oh this game is terrible it's definitely not my fault for getting into this situation in the first place but this is on like super super easy mode that I'm you know still getting myself like tricked into these positions in so I I I'm almost gonna give it to the game's credit that like you know you you can still have those kinds of situations and you have to be careful with your planning at every step it's very much very like it tactical with a capital T for where you place your guys making sure you peek through doors instead of opening them and sprinting through them willy-nilly and getting you know shot by security drones on the way through figuring out a way to lure the guards past so that you have them in the you know you're surprising them rather than surprising you um the final so yeah I guess like the final boss for like x-com stuff you know you've been building out your your x-com soldiers and stuff for fighting uh what is it like a final final boss alien or series of aliens in that game it's like the super Scion person oh right yeah the Scion guy yeah I forgot that was a thing um spoil me for the ending to this game because I'm I'm kind of struggling at the moment of like should I finish this I'm like I'm leaning towards yes but I don't know if like yeah it means I'm gonna spoil the level but not the story finale uh so don't spoil everything if you want but but but but will our dear listeners well they can turn they can turn it off if they want to no no keep listening put more money in the in the dispension yeah yes we need your cred Chips please I need to buy another Gumball I need to put the quarter in the gumball machine um uh so the final level is you have fire you you after here somehow exactly that last mission no matter how many missions it's been is the one where you finally are able to triangulate everything uh and you are heading to the corpo the all the different corporations have teamed up and they've pulled all of their super computers in one facility or whatever and you get uh the weapons dealer and the central controller lady come be on your side too because you have six agents instead of four um and you run through a somewhat larger level than normal and you have to run two a gate or like a a terminal hold off for what five turns there and then we're gonna protect the person sort of like things protect the person from this point and then gather all your people and run to or run to the next one yeah and then and that yeah the main person has to hack it and then she just goes through to the end basically yeah so there is DLC for this game I think it's just like more more stuff to it but well I don't know if you had a chance to check that out I think you were talking about it before I decided not to go through and get it I think uh it's probably just like more agents and more like items right I I don't think that there's like what Colin was talking about like oh the the alternate Fork of the story that oh in this in the DLC it does you know you are the bad guys or something like that yeah I don't think that more like adding more to the same mechanics is not what I want I want more mechanics and so uh I yeah I've decided not to because I at this point you know because I did the Iron Man Expert Plus without taking any losses all the way through I feel kind of like I've got this game pretty much figured out so this deeper endless missions can now go up past 10 difficulty to 20. right I can I could I could play until I eventually fail but that just feels like a grind that like with no like I like to have a little bit of narrative like driving me on I say that but then again I'm still playing slave spiders because it's just such a great game overall but uh so I don't know it just wasn't quite compelling enough for me to continue on and wanted to do more like even I have like more like all the characters unlocked and like but what if I told you what if I told you that right now on Steam Sale it's only one dollar and 24 cents I would rather uh boot up a game than I know I like I kind of feel like I should just buy it so that if I play this game again a second run through I'd have that because that's a pretty I actually at a dollar 24 I feel like it should just be included in the main game like yeah I mean not enough that's not even enough money like I'm assuming that steam's just Steve's taking 30 of that so they're not even making a whole dollar on that well you rake it in from volume though that's the thing um we're obviously getting Kickbacks you know so yeah we're sponsored by yeah uh yeah I think like this game I think would benefit pretty well from like a um like an advanced Edition like we saw work with FTL and upcoming uh into the breach which was just like I mean those that has like more stuff but it adds like will was saying like more more mechanics like it makes the the interplay between the the systems different and like more more of those systems I think I think like that combined with like one or two more kind of like story hooks would be like super compelling um but I think this game like where it is and what it has with you know that comes out of the box totally good you're definitely worth the whatever I don't remember how much it was it cost but it was definitely worth it um and I have a certain rating I'm not really sure if we're ready for the ratings but I have a rating no yeah uh yeah I was gonna wait yeah right now so it's five bucks

uh this was a a particular mechanic that was unique to this game um that I was I was unsure about but I have a pretty strong feeling about it now but like predict movement as a a game element the ability to click on a an enemy unit and then because you have this Artificial Intelligence on your team you're able to employ it to predict where that person is going to walk during their turn and I thought you know like well that's kind of interesting but like first of all it's 100 accurate okay I get it this is a fantasy world or whatever right you know as data scientists there's no way but uh did it help the game did it like because it feels like if if their movement was unknown you'd have to be more cautious whereas if you know where they're moving and you're like oh they're gonna move in my room and I can just sit here like on you know on OverWatch and just yeah get them like the fact that the fact that it's the same like so you were playing on super super expert plus plus difficulty mode and it was just like that's the same predict movement as the easy one where it just shows you the little dotted arrow on the floor right right what I would imagine for super expert mode is a not being able to predict their movements or like having it be a lot more subtle or B like you're kind of talking about with this um probability aspect like show with like a grid on the floor of like you know they're gonna like next turn they're definitely gonna move here the next turn it's like a 50 chance they're gonna move here or here well that's a clever mechanic right wait wait let me add on to this so it costs one power or does it cost one it costs one eight it costs one AP and so if you do it for APS you can put more I would say that it'd be like you click you click once it gives you the probability distribution and you can keep clicking and it'll narrow oh my God that's a good one you can trade action points basically you're observing them for longer and it Narrows in your your ability to predict where you're going to be like that actually feels like a I I'm a big fan of those like Pusher luck or spend resources to make your luck more certain kind of things yeah that's the only mechanic that made it possible for me to have like the the downless sort of runs that were just like yep because a lot of time you're just sitting and waiting anyways and so it's just like you've got a bunch of action points to spend at the end it's just like hey let me just predict everyone's movement and then I don't have to take any chances right yeah you end up you started with nine points and you have like three left and you're like well I guess let's just watch them for a bit especially because when you can hijack once you hijack all the cameras which is or like most of the cameras you have visibility of everyone so the person that's like waiting a turn for you to hack this like terminal can spend all the nine of their action points just like predicting everyone's movement and so do you think it should be maybe not the person it should be the the OverWatch AI that would make more sense thematically I think yeah it doesn't make sense that a person is spending their action points to like or maybe or maybe it's it's one or the other like if it's the cameras that are giving you visibility then you can use the the power if not blah blah blah blah yeah uh we'll kick us off with rankings all right well um I might ten point scale one to ten I give this game an eight uh and an eight is the highest of all the games we've played uh and uh I I think this is genuinely a great game I I think it's not it's not an x-com but it's got its own flavor uh it's got a lot of really interesting narrative um I I do like a lot of these these mechanics like the predict movements I like the that it's not 95 chance at Point Blank to shoot an enemy like x-com and then you miss them and you just pull your hair out because you're like it's like everything is guaranteed and so it feels a lot tighter in that sense um but again the content and the lack of mechanic interplay Beyond just some kind of basic mixing of things and basic synergies is what's keeping it from the higher echelons um but yeah I definitely love the art style um I like the overall narrative and the theme and so um yeah eight out of ten for me which uh like I said that's number one out of all games we played for me yeah I think I'm in a similar boat uh this is like on my one to ten this is an 8.5 for me uh despite not having gotten as far through it uh that puts it just ahead of Dungeons and drip more just behind Binding of Isaac rebirth um for you well I think it's it's just above Binding of Isaac but yeah I think like it's this a super solid game love the art style it seems like every game in uh that's designed to buy clay uh like everyone has like cheekbones that could cut glass uh which I think that that art style is really kind of fun um but yeah like definitely like you know you nailed it uh has its own kind of vibe and flavor and theme to it I really like the stealth mechanics I just wish there was like there's more it's like it's missing like that extra little bit of like salt or pepper like spicing in there to just get the flavors like perfect like it's so close but it's it's not like perfect perfect but it's still like super solid if you've had any kind of like interest in this game I think you would be be well suited to pick it up and play it uh so for me this is the my number two game from the ones that we played so far I liked it a lot um I would say that if we're going with a spice flavor type analogy I would disagree that it didn't have the right spice I would say that it's like something that's it's like you know it's like a weird beer like a peanut butter chocolate stout or uh one of those like really crazy stuff like sour beers where you have like half a glass of it and you're like wow this is great and then you're like getting near the bottom of that glass and you're like yeah that was a pretty good thing you're like I would not want to have another one though I I think one is the perfect amount um it felt like it was a perfect bite size like I played it for 5.3 hours to get through one the first playthrough I I'm not 100 convinced I will play through again on the expert difficulty uh because I don't know if there's a second bite in me um well you got the challenge is can you do it are you good enough or do you suck no I hate challenge though what I hate hard I guess you're talking to the Ascension 20 guy because I have to do it because the challenge is there and so that's why Expert Plus but that's the only reason I kept around for the 22 and a half hours or something I mean I probably will I I probably will try it again but I that's that's the second half of the Pint glass I've had the first clap of the chocolate peanut butter stout and I'm like dang that was delicious I'll probably finish this beer and not get another one versus something like XCOM is like uh it's not as good necessarily for that first uh like I thought the I thought this was like a really

crystallized experience that might not continue to have that much depth going forward and actually like if if people are sort of intimidated by the length of a normal x-com game this might be like a better a better bite-sized x-com of like oh well I don't really want to spend like 35 hours beating one campaign of x-com I'll just spend like six to seven to beat this and there's nothing worse than being like 30 hours into XCOM and like oh no all my good people died I hate I hate saves coming but I'm not gonna start from the scratch so I have to I have to have backup saves I won't do Iron Man because like I I don't wanna I I won't restart 30 hours in week I'm gonna start five hours in

but not 30. mm-hmm and I put 70 I checked I put 72 hours into XCOM so obviously I spent enough time that I I liked that game too that's like a that's a camera XCOM 2. uh I put like three hours of Dex come to I never really played it yeah it's 707 and 74. okay so uh XCOM is a uh is is that all-day IPA you know drink that uh drink that all down a nice nice summer day the first one goes down pretty good and the sixth one goes down pretty good like eight hours later I've been playing x-con for eight hours straight well I promised that we had had something fun and special uh today and I'm gonna post it in the in the Discord here uh we have our first letter from a listener yay uh we have a letter uh that reads A greetings grogpod crew uh gone around to listening to your podcast and the episodes of 2022 after you mentioned it in the uh roguelikes uh subreddit thread quote I miss roguelike radio another good program that you should definitely check out uh so some questions that might be worth answering who are the hosts who is Scott will and Colin how long have you been guys been playing roguelike games or games somewhat related to them including the likes of Diablo or Dwarf Fortress here are you guys casual gamers hardcore Gamers those few who have ascended to some of the harder traditional roguelikes I.E three Rune win and Dungeon Crawl Zone soup those who go above and beyond the simple ascensions 15 Rune win are you just players of the genre or have you had a hand in game development for roguelike games or any game development period is there anything else relevant in your backgrounds that leans into roguelikes um I realized you did a a quick sort of intro into your channel the first episode but it's probably a good time to start covering who you guys are and where you guys might be approaching this podcast from and that's from and I asked for a pronunciation guide on this uh and I got signed off to say Davian [ __ ] uh sorry that was just I couldn't do it n-u-x-a yes uh so it's probably fuchsia or something very very pleasantly sounding um who is the group officer for the steam roguelike group and has a YouTube channel that I'm just gonna say it defucks up plays uh because that's funnier um so yeah thanks for writing in uh to the podcast Davian who really appreciate it um where do we where do we stand with roguelikes we kind of talked about this in the first episode a little bit um don't listen to that episode yeah like all all good podcast you know first podcast episodes it's always the best one right um yeah but yeah I think like our background in roguelikes um for me kind of came to it through the door Fortress angle and you know debatably through games that have rogy elements in them um I think we're we're all uh Diablo heads to some degree uh but yeah I don't think what these are definitely like stay tuned episodes for things like net hack and dungeon Carl Stone Soup but um but yeah like this podcast I think was a a way to kind of focus and produce to play games uh in the roguelike genre that we have played in the past before and enjoyed um but also kind of like Branch out into those new areas that we hadn't kind of really explored at all so things like Dungeons of dreadmore for example uh I think was a good way to kind of get us like into that sort of classic realm um are we casual hardcore um I would say for me I don't know like like what is casual or hardcore oh the fact that you know the normal person out there probably wouldn't jump at the opportunity to play Dwarf Fortress for hours on end but you know given how many steam sales it had recently maybe it's more of a mainstream opinion than I thought um what about you guys so so we have we have some questions so um are you guys hardcore or casual in terms of roguelikes uh have you had a hand in game development or any game development period uh and yeah what what is there what is there about your background that kind of leans into the roguelike element oh if I could take this one first because yeah my immediate my immediate reaction is Hardcore to like maximum like I'm someone who uh I uh you know a data scientist over here like I got in touch with uh the that what was it the Spire logs I believe it was the creator of that website to try and figure out like which what are the tiers of um the relics and all that stuff and this is for again I keep coming back to slay Aspire but I imported that data set it's all Json and basically did like a clustering of the different uh uh uh the X and index on ascension 20 uh of the winning hand of the winning uh uh decks to figure out like what are the different archetypes of the good decks and like which to which like what to what degree do each of the cards fit into each of the different archetypes to try and better answer the question like each point of the game like what is the best decision so I got super into like that Rim world's another one where there's like this like you know great you know you're supposed to choose your own character create your character I went in and imported every single one of the Back stories of the childhood and adult to figure out the best possible combinations and combine that into like kind of a theory of that I think that was something that was posted to Reddit that I can still use today I go on to that spreadsheet that I shared and like it's still something that's out there so I'm super into that stuff in terms of game development right now I'm making a game um this is this is something that is um more about gamification of of Life sort of a thing is meant to address willpower but I've got a whole fun theory that I built outside of roguelikes in general like I think I'm I'm mostly at my core interested in answering the question what is fun and how does it work and I have a whole theory that would be like its own like separate thing that would take hours to describe but like I I analyzed a lot of games and I thought a lot about this stuff and I think I've got pretty good foundation of being able to describe what causes fun and there are some theories out there there's the octolysis framework there's all these other ways of thinking about it but I think I think I don't know that's that's my dream to someday I like publish some work on this stuff but like I'm I'm super into this and gaming has been a huge part of my life since I was young I'm not sure if we mentioned this before but I remember I got I was at one point uh grounded from using my computer so I had to have Colin come over to play Morrowind on the computer so that I could have the experience of marwin that I was banned from I just I was he wouldn't play it he would just watch it right exactly

StarCraft all that stuff Halo growing up I was just been uh into games since uh uh you know even back in the NES days and so I that's just something about who I am that was a long-winded story though sorry about that but uh I get into this stuff and I would say that I am uh as in all things in life exactly in that middle ground I am neither hardcore nor Casual Gamer uh I have not played a particularly large amount of roguelikes before um but I am deeply interested in story generators procedural Generation Um I might be maybe a somewhat skeptical on procedural generation as the in in its ability to create compelling gameplay but I want it to work so bad that I'm willing to keep looking at every game until I find that one that does it um and

yeah I'm mostly just along for the ride having a good time uh and also I I'm I just like I I mean I I'm friends with Scott and will in the real world so no I I'm I'm here as as a video game book club I just want to play some some games with my friends and it's uh it's fun to have a theme and rogueliks are a interesting view into a a lens of a type of game that I I haven't played quite as much and uh they're uh easy to start and you can run through a lot of them very quickly or you could dive so so so deep into any individual one if if it caught your fancy so um I'm I'm into either extreme really

cool well thanks for writing into the uh to the show Davian um if you two would like to have uh your letters that aren't uh blatant advertisements that I haven't read on the podcast so far uh sent to sent into the show you can reach us at grogpodzone gmail.com uh we're on Mastodon like everyone else uh at grogpod game.gamedev.plays we're gonna make it happen we're gonna get there we're gonna get 50 people up on Mastodon you just wait uh including me someday maybe uh until they put quote Tweets in there and then it'll all go to [ __ ] um and uh our website where you can find all that stuff in one neatly packaged little Central Hub at grogpod.zone uh for our website but before we go we have to we have to play uh roguelike roulette or in this case a roguelike coin flip for our next episode because of our uh of our randomly selected options that we have to pick from next week uh these were these were three games that I like could easily see myself like dumping a zillion hours into each so this is kind of like for me like I'm happy with any of the results that come from it but our options for for our next episode being Rift wizard dicey dungeons or stack lands all of which you know will go back into the hopper for selection next time but uh when I saw the you know the Google sheet shoot those I was like yes finally so you know I think we kind of landed on it either being Rift Wizard or stacklands we had sort of a split decision so Colin well I have to say like dicey dungeons though I only rolled that one out because I've already played like it to its maximum and maxed everything out I'm like I can't I mean I could talk about it but I won't have a fun game to play but Colin you have our deciding factor don't you I have a coin uh I'm gonna say I'm gonna say Rift Wizards is heads and and stack lenses Tails stack lenses tail so I'm gonna flip this coin here uh it looks like we're doing stacklands baby okay I'm glad that nobody can actually see the result yes it looks like a giant metal pancake flipping through the air yeah it really does I did have to like look at this coin and try and remember which one was heads and which ones Tails but I do swear it was Tails um

[Music] uh so I definitely want to put that one back in the hopper I want to play that again someday yeah sweet so uh yeah we'll uh we'll see you guys next time for some stack lands we're stacking it up stacking up those silver dollar pancake coins and we're gonna be flipping around for a good time next time thanks for tuning in

[Music] thank you

thank you
