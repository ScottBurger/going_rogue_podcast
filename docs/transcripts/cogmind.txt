Bee Boop, greetings and welcome to the going rogue gaming podcast, it roguelike podcast.
About roguelike games, I am your robot host, gr Dash.
Zero g peeps.
Got Burger.
I am query interrupted joined by my segfault rogue's gallery of co-host.
0:51
Beep, boop.
Greetings it is.
I why 45 Defender Colin?
Yeah.
And I'm gonna pile of angry rusted.
Scrap metal in the corner.
Ah, Salvage.
I see.
Yes.
Today we are talking about Cog Mind released October 16th, 2017 Early Access on Steam but also drm-free on the grid Sage games website.
1:19
This is a roguelike a traditional roguelike game developed by a solo Dev Josh G, who's a salute of working from Taiwan And Cog mine this week rolls in at our 344th most popular roguelike in our data set with 1214 total reviews in the distribution at the 90th percentile.
1:41
Colin, you have come across a terminal that hacks into this podcast and you have your hacking sweet enabled.
You have your your system sweet enabled and you are ready to hack into the the podcast entry.
1:58
Or Cog mine.
All right.
What's my percent chance of success?
Your percent chance is 75% but I'm guessing the lower entry when I rolled in that one.
So apparently I don't hack into the computer but luckily there's another terminal right next to you that has not been shut down and you can hack that one for the for the workout that's eleven.
2:19
So that's going to hatch going to work?
Yes.
Of COG mind is one of it isn't actual traditional roguelike.
Something we hadn't played that much of But I guess it's untraditional in some ways because the thing that I like the most about it is like you are a constantly evolving constantly, mutating robot.
2:41
The things that you start out with will have almost no bearings on what you have on you.
Two levels later.
Things are constantly being blown off of your core and you're trying to run and grab the wheels of the bot.
You just killed and slap them on.
2:56
So you can get away from the robots that are following you it's fairly.
I would say that it's a fairly difficult game in that you are not.
Combat, builds are different, are are hard to do?
3:15
They, the enemies are hard, and I don't think it's intended for you to fight everything.
You should be blasting your way through the levels, you have to pick and choose your fights and slowly build up your Bot and hopefully keep a couple of the good things you found along the way.
3:34
And make your way to robot Zion.
Yeah, I think this this game compared to, I think the only other traditional roguelike games grid-based, turn-based, permadeath RPGs with bad Graphics have been sort of the Stars, the pit and I guess to some extent Hack Slash loot.
3:57
If anyone remembers that 10 Dungeons of Dredmor, not just a dragon.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
The dungeons red Mars, the most traditional one that we've done, how can I forget Dredmor?
And yeah all those games are very the fight monster heavy, but this one feels like it goes in the complete opposite direction Where You Are, It's, I guess it's not fair to say that you're penalized for combat but you're strongly disincentivized from fighting everything you see.
4:31
Yeah, you can fight but you shouldn't just stand and fight.
It's like a rearguard action.
You shoot the things that are fast and run away from the things that are slow.
That's my general strategy. one thing I particularly like about Cog mind, is that it, it feels very It feels like you get the the aesthetic and the world that you're in almost immediately.
4:59
So you are in COG mind you are a robot that ascends from the the depths of think it's like the the trash or rubbish bin from this humongous robot Factory.
And every every level that you get to next, I'd like that.
5:20
It reminds you of your goal and you have one goal and that is to To escape.
And very much in the opposite end of the spectrum.
From like what we've seen with the pit or Dredmor with those like you're descending down to some goal, but in this case, you're ascending up to escape from this.
5:40
Robot Factory reminds me of some other geese.
Lay, the something, I don't remember where your ascending some kind of a spiral.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm.
And much like slay, the Spire.
You have all sorts of stealth mechanics.
And hacking and lots of typing going on, and lots of hacking commands to memorize along.
6:02
The way, it's basically the exact same game.
I may be slightly Spire was inspired by this game because it did come out after.
So, and so with that, all of the praise of the game is done right now.
We're onto the lengthy diatribe.
6:21
The, all right, well, our two minutes of hate have at it.
Now, okay, I'll just be fair here.
So you guys have all we're just talking about this.
What's got your out of the house now or ten thousand dollars and the game?
I think even if I was at 1000 hours I would probably okay.
6:37
I think like 1,000 hours you've probably seen all the content the game, I crossed over the hundred hour mark this weekend and I still feel like I'm maybe I don't know, have explored 35 40 % of the game in total.
I feel like I mean by that.
Like what do you think is not there?
6:53
What is your unknown?
You're known unknowns.
Um my unknown unknowns are things about delving into interactions with like NPC factions deeper.
So this Tuesday, they just released that content like last weekend and so obviously you haven't like no well for at least more.
7:15
Yeah I mean the keeps coming out with more.
Yeah the development for this game is fascinating to follow because there's there's a lot of stuff in this.
Yes.
But it doesn't feel overwhelming with like oh my God I have to keep on top of all of this stuff.
Like I feel like you can you can play through a run of COG minded not need to be like to memorize every little detail about the game, but there is a lot of stuff that if you choose to go down that path, there's a whole like different entire branch of different strategy that awaits you and one that just released.
7:53
So at the time of According were recording just after one of the major reworks to the garrisons, which are basically like we're enemies spawn out of and you can you can go into these areas and it's a whole separate level biome and what I was streaming this for will if you a few days ago like okay, let's check this out.
8:18
Let's go into this new area that like I've been in here before, but I want to see what's reworked in here Basically my absolutely smashed immediately.
I mean yes but I don't know if I was playing Super optimally but my goal was to be a flight based speed hacking mail, a slasher robot and shit goes down.
8:41
Things start blowing up, I lose my Flying Fortress and so I'm like, okay, I guess I got a slap on some Treads here and start tank trading around.
And then things, more things just keep exploding and Will's like Okay, well, when does the fun start?
8:57
I'm like, look at it.
Look at all the explosions in robots and everywhere you.
Are you kidding me?
Look at what, look at that.
What this is my big bright eyes.
I boot this game up, I'm looking at the starting screen.
I'm like, what am I?
I see a bunch of like looking at the way he tricks 8 by 8 pixels.
9:13
Is that what a little square is something like that?
You can't make anything look good in the eight by eight and I might be getting that wrong but it's it's so incredibly small. all it's like what a robot is is It just looks ridiculously stupid and simplistic.
9:32
I couldn't tell what I was for the longest time.
I had to move around and be like oh that strange set of block, blue arrow thing.
Oh Lucy seat.
Okay yeah.
That makes a lot of sense.
And then we it just this this this game.
9:48
I am the first time I booted up to.
I'm just looking at this interface and I'm just like, I shut it down.
I tried it again.
Next day, I opened it up.
I looked at it for a minute and read some of the documentation.
No, I just couldn't and then I started playing and I tried to get into it, I'm like okay here we go.
10:03
I know what things do now and it was just not fun at all.
The the game Loops the little the mechanics about.
Yeah you going to balance your your energy and the types of weapons and the types of enemies have different things that they you know, they're weak and strong against, but you have to right?
Click them.
You have to right-click everything because you need to see what everything going wrong.
10:20
And you just it's just like and this is all these attributes are assigned as a little like strange-looking Square on the screen.
You're like, oh this is some Epic monster and this other Square are here.
That's almost identical to it.
Oh this is just a little peon and it can't do anything to you and it's just like, that's stupid.
10:37
I'm sorry game creator.
But this game is not for people like me who need like 32 by 32 or just something where like it's slightly more than what you've reduced it to.
So I I hear your critique and I'm curious how you square that with your love of War, simple, very easy.
10:59
It's very easy.
It's not it's not even yet.
So that's a text based game complete text everything.
That's interesting is like, well first of all, like I played this game as an Optimizer of a betting game and so it wasn't, I the all the the blocks of text, all the lore drops all that crap, kind of skip through a lot of that stuff, but most of it was just navigating screens where it's like here is text is Like, here is like a square with eight pixels that were, I'm supposed to guess, what the hell?
11:25
This is.
It's like when they actually do ASCII art, it was beautiful asking.
All right, well, I mean, like, interesting at least like the face is the, the building's, the like, the shipyard?
These were like, well, duh, I thought in this game, art right-clicking on everything to see the shape of something, which you only see in like the details menu, and it's just like, know the actual gameplay.
11:46
You don't interact with that stuff, you know.
It's just so I guess my question, To is.
If this exact, like, gameplay is the same, but everything reskinned in very high quality art like Dredmor Sprites or something, right?
12:05
Yes, of course, like, Dread my heart.
Well, I'm not like that, that, I mean, honestly, like, in terms of size, yeah, That would help a lot.
It wouldn't face everything, but that would, that would improve my rating of this game by two or three points by minimum at a minimum I will.
12:25
So yeah I guess like I will submit to Wills criticism that like the main sort of field of view that you have.
So that this game is you know like like other traditional roguelikes is top down, you know you have your your character model which is literally just like a my lized.
12:44
See ya.
It's a stylist.
See it's a single tile and it can be hard to see?
I because I'm insane.
I think I played.
Like the, I don't know the 10 or 15 hours of this on the steam deck over the past like week or so.
And that was that was kind of testing my eyesight pretty bad.
13:03
I think if someone hadn't there was like a community layout that you could map like a magnifier to one of the back buttons and I was constantly hitting that of like okay I don't I don't need glasses, I don't need them because I have this magnifier this is also maybe one of like and this game was clearly not designed to play in a steam deck that being said, If it were because like the pit of, I mean, also not kind of optimized for the steamed egg, but you can see it Dredmor.
13:30
You can see it if Cog mind, I think had that kind of friendlier graphical approach.
I think it would.
It would open itself a lot more to a broader Community.
Now, that being said, I do really like, you know, the the weapons that are down on the ground and not being like overwhelmed with the visual complexity of them.
13:51
I can right click it.
It and the like the very worsse me like ASCII art design of like oh this this like super automated Gauss Cannon or this heavy linear accelerator weapon and like that's pretty dope.
Like the way that that is designed and just very like artistically sci-fi e created, I feel like I am like this is what a robot would see if it looked at this thing on the ground.
14:19
Yeah, I think it's extremely thin.
Attic.
Like I think it works all visual aesthetic of it works really well as a compliment that theme, I will say that it has one of the criticisms.
14:36
I have for like a couple of other than the, like 8-bit style games, which is it's not great for readability like you, it's all caps, which is hard to read, and it's like the like, Pixel pixel font style, which makes it a little harder too.
14:59
Quickly, grok the many, many different attributes of various things.
But I have not found that maybe it's just that I got through the hump of understanding and so that like I know, which parts that I need to look for when I'm looking for something, it's like, oh, I want to figure out I'm trying to figure out like, which gun should I be using to shoot this thing?
15:22
Psycho, I just, you know, could scan really quick and see it.
But, I mean, I found that same problem in some of the other games that we've played we're just like it's easy to overwhelm with information and I'm The really clear system of disseminating information is nice which Cog.
15:43
Mine does an okay job at it.
Not a great job.
What about the actual like combat Loop?
How do you feel about that?
Because as we play the recently, we played fights in tight spaces as just like an example here of like, yeah, that's extremely tactical.
16:02
You have to think ahead of with your moves and like you're moving, this guy here and that guy you like sometimes the direct conflict but like in this game is just like there.
Dude, I do missile after no.
Okay.
Sorry, it's a little more complex than that.
It's you you see?
Okay, there's a dude he's on the screen.
First you decide do I want?
16:19
Attack, do turn or run away, okay, makes us you.
There's some things that go into that decision, if attack, it was he week to do, I have that weapon in my inventory if so equipped and then like attack that guy is just basically once you have gone through this kind of pre this boring, I might add like, mechanic of like do attack known attack equipped weapon.
16:37
Then it's just click on thing, then goes or not always sometimes you miss and then you just have this like slugfest back and forth until it blows up, and that is the tactics in a nutshell.
Well, I mean, okay, maybe I'll say something all, we can Retreat into a corridor and then, and then, you know, that's where you use your rocket launcher to get them all where their numbers are putting nothing, but I just didn't find that to be a huge part of the gameplay like, and maybe there was something I was missing there, but it seemed to me, like, Optimal strategy was shoot the over the thing at the thing and then it goes, boom.
17:11
I think because combat here is not really the focus that it hits.
Again, what is well?
So the focus here is to escape getting it.
Is it is a, it is technically I feel like how did I build this?
17:27
I was recently thinking of this game as a as Mecha Gear Solid.
Because you are stealthing your way around this facility.
You can do combat but you don't want to raise your alert too much because then the combat just becomes overwhelming and your goal is to you know, be sneaky and eventually you know complete this Mission objective that you have.
17:54
There are so like yes, the way that you've described the combat Loop is one way that you can approach it.
If you are just walking in with a very Normie mindset of run-and-gun.
Just I see thing.
I shoot.
Oh no.
Because the first actions, do you run away or do you shoot if you engage with something?
18:13
You pretty much need to kill them because otherwise they chase you down.
That's not true.
You can.
If you hide, they will lose track of you and you again like a - for that.
Yeah.
Strongly.
There are so.
So the ECM sweet and you just go hide in a weird Corner.
They don't find you, your your options in this game so you are presented Almost constantly with just a barrage of Parts on the floor or things that you harvest from other robots by either blowing them up or buzzing.
18:45
Sawing them off, or by coming up to two different machines and having them like, pinata, loot explode out and all those things.
And that I think helps to really inform your Tactical choices here.
Where, you know, are you so you are on a floor and your goal is to find Find an exit to the floor and the result like a hundred enemy robots in your way and you don't know where they are and your goal is to well maybe I don't want to alert the entire floor and have 500 robots chasing and shooting me at every at every turn.
19:18
So maybe instead what I'll do is I'll equip you know, some kind of melee Implement to dig my way through different walls and if I have like radar equipment that allows me to see the robot patrols that are coming down the hallway.
And then, maybe I'll wait, and then they'll go back down the hallway and I can.
19:36
Okay, now it's clear for me to move.
You just like there's different weapon types that do different things.
I think you kind of touched on, you know, you shoot man or like you equip a thing that does, you know, the bonus damage to them and it kills them, but how it kills them?
19:55
Can vary drastically change.
What?
Your gameplay strategy might break.
There's the like the last one I did.
I was using The EMP pulse wear it like does integrity damage, and it just like you can kill stuff really easily, but oftentimes corrupts the things that are left behind.
20:16
So if you get hurt during that fight, you get left with a bunch of stuff that's not really usable.
And so, in some way more stuff and in some ways it's like a higher chance of it being corrupted which you can kind of use or pendant not risk reward with corruption though is like if you if you kill the robot and a All their stuff but that's all corrupted.
20:35
You can put it on right?
Then they raises your corruption M where then like maybe sometimes like you're done we'll just fire for no reason which if you're in like an NPCs faction Hideout and you blow something up and own it.
You know you've made an enemy of them for life.
20:51
Now with your hold strategy is gone up in air or you've blown up a reactor and alerted.
All the Box on the floor to where you are.
Things can go sideways unexpectedly and really change up what you were thinking about doing.
And I feel like I feel like will is going to disagree with, but I think that it is a game of many interesting decisions, because your robot is so constantly changing and the relative positions of you versus the things that you're around, you is so mean it's like okay, I'm in a firefight with this thing.
21:25
I'm going to win and then a second later, another robot shows off and your heavy assault gun gets blown off of you.
And I Now, the calculus for this fight has changed dramatically and quickly and you're like, all right now?
21:40
What's the best way to flee?
Like, oh no, they blew off my wheels.
So, I'm overburdens, like, well, how do I figure out which of these things do?
I need to drop off so that I can get away quickly.
I think, managing your weight capacity is a huge part of the game because your propulsion systems are constantly getting destroyed and it's like, well, now I'm your overburdened and it's not like Skyrim we're at, that's just like a thing that happens every once in a while, and you just throw away, your million herbs that you've collected or the pots and pans or the silver you've stolen, like, you'll throw away things that you very much.
22:19
Wanted to keep your like, oh, I have this sensor that I want.
I can get this other sensor.
And then I like, oh, I you can see the building towards energy like I have to discard this energy because it's going to it's going to come online and too long.
22:34
And I won't be able to like I'll die.
Now.
Yeah, if I try and get that Synergy later, I feel like if this game had like all the systems are there all of the interactions between all of the decisions and like there's lower there if you want it.
22:54
Like like for me this is like very much a Scott game where it has like literally everything I could ask for.
But maybe held back a little in the graphics department.
And I understand why just from like how the game was developed.
But like, if this was, if like, if this was a game that had like, Super Nintendo level graphical Fidelity, but the same same aesthetic and was like, for the most, well, I guess I got it the most, the mouse controls in this game are very good.
23:24
It is very keyboard he because there's a lot of command typing.
But if this was a game that was like, more or less, Is playable with like a like Super Nintendo controller.
This would be like Wills greatest game of all time.
I feel like gimme into the breach Graphics that isometric out of this actually, into their brand.
23:41
And you've got, then you've got a good game but I can't play it as as.
It's just I don't care about the C shape on the the I just I have a I've struggled to like like to make those decisions.
Have been oh man, I really hope I survive my I just go just go YOLO.
23:57
Like maybe I'll you know, pull it off.
Or Die whatever.
I don't give a shit like that's how like, I don't know.
I just don't care.
It's about getting to the next level.
Like if I can't just roll the dice and get like some overpowered ridiculous.
Run like, whatever.
I'll just restart.
24:13
I have it.
I have a thought.
This game is sneaky Archer the game.
Like the point is never to get into face on combat with the troll.
It's always to be like, it feels like every part of this game is the parts of Of Morrowind or Skyrim that I like, where you're like trying to break the system.
24:33
You're trying to like figure out how to cheat your way through the walls or like oops.
I went into an area that's too hard.
Somehow I still manage to like get the thing and get out.
Like I stole the like, the Prototype level 5 Fusion core even though it's the first level.
24:54
And now, I have like absolutely great Energy System way before I Should and I managed to sneak my way out with that.
Like everything.
Well, that's the thing is like that prototype.
It really cool thing in every other type of RPG that's going to be on the pedestal behind.
25:13
The thing will be a being guarded by, but in this game is like here are five of them laying on the ground in one room.
Well, okay.
So what's like it's just such a like maybe I'll prototype but like it's just like a, you walk into a room and here's six of this like thing on the ground it's just like, this is how items are doled out to you.
25:30
You either kill them off of dude or they're just a bunch of them, lie on the ground and in this is that weird?
It's stupid for like the the garbage tier stuff where if you're in a panic and you're like, damn I have had all of my wheels blown off.
I need to figure out where the hell I can get some kind of legs.
25:49
So I'm not Not taking like, you know, a thousand time units per turn and all of the other, you know, units are like going at warp, speed around me because it takes forever to move like, yeah, you can, you can find that room that has like all of the like the standard equipment.
26:04
Six data Jack's.
Yeah.
And where the really interesting fluid flexibility of this game comes in, is that like, yeah, you have your standard stuff there.
There are prototype things like, like, what you would find in, In like Binding of Isaac pills or like unidentified equipment in other RPGs were like, I need to identify this, but instead of a scroll of identify like, well, okay.
26:29
So there's some items that do that but like you attach it to your, your little player character and like you will identify it that way.
And other times you can hack what that thing.
Might be from like a terminal nearby but sometimes it might be faulty and generally speaking those are better components.
26:49
Will in that stream that I was doing for you, where I was getting my shit rocked by all of the enemies in the, like, the Garrison, I wound up exploring some more because I was trying to find like, the pack installer component.
27:06
And like, I was like, oh well, I guess.
Maybe I'll come up to this terminal here.
And so, it shows me that there's like, 45 hidden exits on here.
Like, okay, this must be part of the big update that they rolled out.
Out and much more expansive than I thought.
27:21
It was digging around.
Come across this like the like what you're describing the pedestal of forbidden equipment, where everything was like three or four levels higher than what I was at.
Like, whoo boy.
Here we go.
This is the, the money melon right here.
Attached on some super like heavy weapons and I was like, okay, now I'm in business, this is going to like drive my gameplay for the next little bit, ran around some more 2, more levels, and Floors.
27:50
And so or well.
So I got the got the hack installer.
So I could hack robots, but I still had the super cannon on me, running around and I got to this one area, I'm like, okay in all of my runs before I've gotten to this Zone, that's been pretty well heavily defended.
28:06
Now, I've got the super cannon.
I'm a pretty decent like attack bot.
I'm going to see how much damage I can do them.
Finally get to this thing that I've wanted to get at.
It's just been dangling in front of me this whole time, blow away.
All of like the super Howard Gardner, dudes, and I mean eventually, run out of ammo.
28:24
So then I get surrounded by like two or three other guys and I have to like pivot and make those on the Fly decisions but I wound up like loot like having that big heavy Canon blown off of my body.
Couldn't pick it up again but I still had the hacking ability.
So the like I'm surrounded by two or three robots.
28:41
I go up in hack.
One of them to turn them into an ally.
So now it's a two V two fight run up to the other Bots and hack him while the fights going on.
So it's a 3 V 1 and then that body eventually dies, we run into like this big like very fragile library of mainframes and I'm like, okay, maybe I can run into here and like do the thing and then all of my Ally robots are starting to attack everything else.
29:05
Like all everything is just like blowing up all around and to me this is like this is the quintessential Cog mind experience here.
Soldier fucking the fusion, or whatever thing that I found, I had to hack, open a heavily like a door, a giant heavy door, and it was sitting on basically sitting on a pedestal in that room almost exactly the way you described.
29:31
I mean, there was no visual pedestal but it was like, that's it.
That's what I mean.
It was a 3 by 3 is a 3 by 3 room with this thing in the middle on the 1 square or something like that.
It's also worth noting that some of the the NPC faction leaders.
That you can encounter do offer, those kind of like run guiding parts.
29:53
So your main, your main through line of the game is, yeah, you're in this Factory or this, this robot Multi-tiered floor structure.
It's like ten floors.
So you have 10 levels you start in like level 11 is your kind of like very tutorials and then you come up and then you're like the first couple levels are still very tutorial e but you can either go up or to a side branch and side branches are typically like NPC story or faction related, content and early game.
30:26
Those side branches can give you like a good, a good starting weapon.
Or they can give you access to one of the early factions, the Exiles and they will give you basically like wallhacks for free right at the start of the game.
30:45
But again, another really interesting trade-off here is that you align with them.
It's going to piss off some other factions where you can't just faction stack.
All of your like get everyone on your side.
Basically like you go with one.
You're going to piss off to others which I think is very interesting.
31:01
It creates that kind of dynamic.
MC like okay.
Do I really want to go with this guy?
If I want to try getting this guy over here to invade the final level later with me and caused a big distraction trade-offs.
But some of those faction leaders will give you like Exiles.
31:16
They'll give you like a, like, a choice of three items.
You can take all three and be greedy and typically, these are like much higher power than what you have in that really gain.
These are like mid to late game items that are pretty decently good.
And I think for the most part all unique to, You won't find it anywhere else but that will, that will help Define your run.
31:39
You'll suffer some consequences from it.
If you're greedy, which is fun and yeah, like there's one option for a giant laser on a pedestal that will blow up an entire room for you.
I mean I'm still coming back to like the no matter how you're putting it like on a pedestal.
31:57
Like it's still like this little block on the right.
Like I still like a weapon is like, it looks like a little plank.
And I don't, it might say, supercharged linear disrupter and it's just as his most badass name, ever, but you look at it, it's like fucking 8 pixels on the line inside a blogging.
32:13
You're like, oh okay.
So while you're talking they're like okay here.
Okay so into the okay this is I'm fixing Cog, mine real is in these three or four steps, okay?
It's into the breach graphics and isometric.
It's got a meta progression.
32:31
That is one of the key things that like, right now, if there was a metaphor dresser, like, if I were to use a certain, like weapon enough times or like, you know, like, essentially dangle some kind of even if it's a small unlock and I keep coming back to the greatest game of all times latest fire.
But like, yeah, you put eventually you earn enough points and then you unlock a card and the card is not like most of the time like it's just a girl.
32:52
Here's our card to keep you like, there's still things that you can get our other artifacts and these things you can get them in the game normally, but this is like, makes it so you can choose it and just give me that.
Kind of progression to get me a bike over.
A hump, maybe you guys are talking about, like, maybe I need to get in 30 hours right now.
I'm just like, why the fuck do I wanna?
33:08
Keep ya.
It has a steep learning curve.
I feel like it does, like Scott was saying, ayo the, the first level I liked the tutorial.
I was like it's really not a tutorial level.
It's like a dump of Loot and you can like choose which things you want.
33:27
I think that cock mine could do more to on. onboard people like you the choice to go through the like super baby Zone where you get taught a little bit more like you can do hacking more risk-free.
33:50
Like maybe they could do something where it's like the first couple times you play if there is a minute like the the level you start at unlike, the normal game.
Now, maybe that could be like meta progression 3 where you get the first couple times where you're, you're Going through and you're like, you're trying it, you're trying to, you haven't even gotten to the first floor yet?
34:09
Yeah.
Or just, like, try and escape from like, give me the goal of escape from level 3.
Or like, you know, go up three flights and Escape like it just seemed to Exiles or some, right?
And then the next time it's for like or do the Haiti style where it's just like, okay, you're trying to escape but like an each time like you cannot, you can choose to like ramp up the difficulty.
34:28
You know, you start to add money, you know, - modifiers to yourself as your meta progression weapons and things increase.
So that way you kind of have these.
Counterbalancing aspects of the game, everything is getting harder but also the things that you have to deal with it get more advanced like these are the kind of like Advanced like Like I want to say normal sort of good understandably, good mechanics that we know about these days and it's just seems like this game is severely lacking because it doesn't have these core components for me.
34:56
Yeah, I think that the meta progression is knowledge which is is this a I've had the same problem with some of the other games we've played, which is not like that require such a huge investment to get to the point where The game feels good, Dwarf Fortress style, like you have to like, do a hundred hours.
35:18
It took a real job.
Or where's the like I've tried I know, and there's just no payoff with.
There was no payoff for that for me.
And this is game.
I read the documentation, I sat there and I read every line of adjust.
So it'd be like this.
I understand everything, I think.
And it still didn't make the game more fun.
35:33
I think the, the comparison with Hades, now that I think about it, it makes more and more sense from like, yes, this game.
Does not have the meta progression.
I feel like if you were like a 400 level IQ, Brainiac you could beat this game your first time playing through which I feel like they're it.
35:53
This game would almost be better served if there was that kind of like Hades style, you know, your goal is to escape in both circumstances.
Your goal is to progress through different biomes as you're going up, the levels of this hell dungeon very much the same, you know, there Are different NPCs that you can interact with the give you different different modifiers and helpfulness, which is very easy to how you're deciding, how to do your run, but Cog mine, 100% lacks that meta progression, even just in terms of like, like Lord, Lord dump or hacks were like, oh, I've like entered this factions area for the first time.
36:36
Now, like, I can do these like new hacking abilities or something.
The next time that I I play I feel like that that could be something interesting to add.
But yeah, I think like there's there's some missing element of of meta here that I think could be well integrated.
36:56
But I think also for me, I yeah like that learning curve of new meta stuff like who I want to.
I want to go back and try this the next time I play.
That's kind of like the only meta that you have right now.
Yeah, II.
Get I understand where, and how this This game got to where it is because that kind of meta progression is in some ways against the tree, the true traditional roguelike game, like, which I might say, is bad, but I'm not saying that I agree with it necessarily, but I can see how it got there.
37:37
There's a, there's a certain Purity in every run starts the same.
There is No, like no meta progression as a badge of honor in that like it is.
It's like, saying, do you want to meta progression for chess or for Starcraft?
37:57
But I do, I want, I want a net aggression to max out at 60, 40 to 60 hours and then that's when it's 11 Level Playing Field and like, I think.
But, you know, that you've earned all of your stuff, right?
Exactly.
Then that, that it's just like in Starcraft 2.
I you don't start with all the the, the dudes, right away.
38:16
You slowly, learn about them.
Yeah, I guess it is, but I immediately give a counter example.
As myself.
When people start playing go they play on those seven by seven board or the five by five or whatever and they slowly progressed up to the board that breaks robots brains until recently right.
38:34
And and like that's the that's actually very intentionally podcast on that reason.
But anyways that's there is a but that like that Salk is a very known mechanic in games where you have the difficulty and the other challenge level on two axes and like you want to stay in this narrow chat, channel is extending out and to the right which is just like the So that you're always like, it's difficult, but not too difficult, and your skill is good, but it's always like being challenged.
38:58
And so in the beginning is you shouldn't be greeted with the possibility of Maximum difficulty in my view.
I mean, that's just like, I mean a known thing about human engagement.
I mean, and I feel like this game, the theme supports it more than most roguelikes would like, you're playing something like Dungeons of Dredmor or just like the original roguelike.
39:20
If you died last run, there's no way to copy your spirit back to a different person.
That's not how like physics of those kind of games work.
But this is like a weird, robot game where you absolutely could have something that fits entirely. within the theme of like, yeah, every time you die, you are able to transmit some amount of some limited amount of data, back to yourself, that increases, your abilities, increases your knowledge, increases your, where you can start, and where you can do certain things, and you don't even really need like, it doesn't have to be a super strong connection to make those kind of like things like possible from a narrative like Point printed point of view and like the the the game that we played recently, I mean by in Dubai Binding of Isaac.
40:06
There is a meta progression there like you can experience all of the things like randomly come across them.
But like eventually, like it was, if I recall correctly eventually, you unlock things by doing certain things that the game, like if you have a certain number of Hearts, you unlock a character but but what a lot of times there are no more defects or the things that you pick up in the game.
40:26
Would be things that you unlock by just doing quirky things in the game as like, well, it doesn't make sense that you couldn't do that from the beginning.
But like, do we care that you can now get this thing that you couldn't.
I don't know.
It's just like there's just slowly introducing complexity and it's a way of just making it so that you're not hit with this giant wall of possibilities in the beginning, right?
40:44
Or are there something like something that guides your build a little bit from the get-go, like I'm playing plasma mind where, you know, e.m. weapons are 50%, more efficient for me and I cringe away a little bit because if it's the same thing it's like it takes away the purity of the run like your start, everything the same and like Cog mind is such a game about morphing your way through these obstacles.
41:15
Like your, as your parts are getting blasted on, you're just running and grabbing smashing things on like, it feels like an anime Trope of like, Something where you're just like the robot absorbing things around it and building it into its into itself.
41:37
And like you're you're you're harvesting scrap and you're building your new body out of it as you're going along and you're like a calamari Gundam Momo's.
Yeah, exactly.
And I do think it would take, I do think it would take something away to have stuff like that but it may add it.
41:56
Maybe the two steps forward one step back kind of thing.
So it might, you know, like takes away from some bit but it makes it so much easier to on board and on-ramp and gain a deep understanding of the game.
Yeah, if there was yeah I think like I can't believe I never thought of this before but you've both just like hit that absolute like yes of course like nerve of like this game with like Hades Hades style meta progression and into the breach Graphics is like maybe the perfect game of all time.
42:37
I think we've all agreed on that and do it's at least, at least something I could.
Tolerate and try to get into.
I think if you were to add, like if I the third thing on that list, then would be in my view like Not Just Energy is exposed through like the raw goodness of putting like, oh here's the fifth plus, 50% 2.
42:55
E.m. thing plus the M thing, but like actually have unique sort of synergies form, like a vampire survivors sort of like, oh, you have this homing thing and this like a rocket launcher and now together, like, and I, I mean, Like beautify in a way that like, maybe they has some added effect.
43:16
I want to a defect level of synergy, not just, oh, this is good with that sort of a thing.
Oh, you mean like this specifically like a set bonus.
Almost kind.
Yeah.
That I want said bonuses, that's exactly what I want.
And that way, it guides your run even more and it makes those decisions about.
43:32
Do I drop this thing.
That helps my set out you know if I get one more element than I guess you know, plus 20% Shields are like an extra like one hit like damage.
That's gets negated because it's the the Shogun re bonus or I don't know if you know some kind of weird thing but like that would be I think that'd be fun.
43:48
I'm a big fan of fun and so on.
Yeah.
So one thing that caught my does that I think is really.
It is good.
Eat you can play this game with Will.
You're complaining about the graphics?
Now, did you play it on?
Ask you about at all?
44:05
There is a, I don't remember what the key is, but there is a button that you can press, and it just seamlessly shifts, like, like a matrix style flow down into full asking mode, so you can play it in like true.
True robe like fashion, I It would be interesting if you kept these same Graphics.
44:24
You just had one more thing where it's like, Turn it up instead of down.
It's like a ski mode to what we currently have.
And then we currently have up to like the stupid casual like gamer level.
44:40
Yeah.
Like every talking about, turn it up from original Nintendo to Super Nintendo, I really want a baby daughter to the breach.
I want to see like the little dudes and I want to see them with the weapons that they actually have equipped and I want them to move just a little bit Emily shoot.
44:57
Do they have like a really cool animations and like, oh my God, be it would be, it would be difficult?
Yeah.
Then you have a lot of different combinations.
It would be hard to have a I'm not saying it's easy.
Yeah.
But I want like good seeing the Cog mind growing I would be like Katamari Damacy in his weapons on him and slow like morphing into things.
45:19
If you could build some sort of like Pixel generator that auto down and maybe have it be not the same every time, maybe it's like it.
Maybe it's not perfect.
Maybe it's a little bit funky because I that's exactly what I want that's actually it's like he doesn't give a great, it doesn't integrate well every time because you're not like a custom-built robot with all of these things that are are not designed to have this robot arm data, just like just like literally shoved into your weird side.
45:51
It's like, Not sticking out of your shoulders, sticking out of like your torso that.
This is what I want.
So when you're upgrading this game, you like you're choosing utility or power or whatever.
I want you to be able to put every single thing into the propulsion slot.
And I want you to have 50 legs, if you want 50 legs.
46:09
And I want to see that like, I mean, as I mean, you can have I know, I know exactly.
And I just like, that's a court.
Like, I don't have a I've constraints around this it with the the game I'm developing, but like these are the things that we want you to be able to To replace a weapon slot with a utility slot.
46:27
I want to have this sort of like flexibility and I think that I would be and that's something you can only do in like a cyborg world.
Or in this case, in this kind of like, you know, MechWarrior sort of world.
And I think it's a really fun idea.
Future episode for sure will is basically.
Describing the visual modifications of how risk of rain to works.
46:48
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Because the more risk of rain like right when it came out and I haven't touched it since then.
Yeah.
Because if you get it like yeah you have like three pairs of like sniper glasses on.
They show three pairs of sniper glasses on your body which at like after like an hour and a half of your run, you look like an absolute clown running around but it is it is quite great with all of the missiles and stuff flying off of your body.
47:15
So, Have you beaten Cog mind.
I'm sure you have at least once.
I feel like beat is such a weird term, but yes, I have.
I think I have escaped one time.
Yeah.
And I've gotten to the like weird alien.
47:32
Tech level floors a couple times.
But spoilers.
No.
Have, I'm never gonna get to the end.
So, doesn't act lease.
Well, every game that we talked about.
So it's nice.
Also feel like that's barely a spoiler.
Like, yeah, there's so much weirdness that goes on with.
47:49
I don't like most of my Cog mine not so recently so I don't I literally don't remember enough to spoil the like the true weird secrets of the upper floors.
I do remember having like crazy teleporting stuff and absolute.
48:07
It was just like producing energy and dissipating.
He did you get like much much more powerful but then the enemies are like also doing crazy shit.
Yeah, I think that this game does does power creep very well.
Where.
Yeah, I'm very excited, like later, as the game goes on, I'm very excited to pick up new things because a the titling of all the weapons is his hilarious and great where you have like, Super Omega Annihilator 9000, or there was one one unique piece of equipment that I desperately wanted to try out those like it was some kind of like like brain emulsifier or something where it was very much.
48:51
Much like its intent is to go in and just like permanently convert this enemy to an ally and they can't they can't resist no matter what like yes, I 100% want to use this against some big bad guy such.
I'm just looking through a list, enhanced gamma bomb, array, gravity flail perf Cannon, he'll file missile launcher impact, mace, Advanced guided micro new clauncher like you, get some wild stuff Omega cannon, the Mortal Cannon Point, Singularity launcher, Yellow Cab.
49:35
And I don't think I've ever seen that, but heavy wave guns.
Like, there's stuff in here that I had, absolutely not seen.
Yeah, because it's the thing on the pedestal, behind the locked door behind the guards, behind the Hylian Shield, you have to go find the tractor beam to turn off or whatever.
49:58
One thing that we haven't talked about, which I 100% do not expect, we'll To have dived into this at all, but I think the like the writing in this game is unexpectedly very good.
Yeah, I remember like I want to be the kind of person who likes Laura and I usually don't that much but I do feel like it has as love, Right Touch.
50:21
Yeah, it gives you just a hint of lore but not like right now I have to walk around the village and talk to every person because maybe they'll say something interesting.
There was a.
So a lot of this game's lore comes through terminal hacks.
50:36
Like, we've talked about before, and there are some NPCs that do give you like, massive lure dumps of, like, You know, this is like this is the whole explanation about this thing.
And like, I think the writing, for those individual segments is very good at creating this world and helping you like, believe that you're part of it.
50:57
But also like, there's an underrated aspect of like the broader world that this game takes place in, in general.
And like, when I when there's an achievement for it of finding out, like the lore behind Your player character, the Cog mind that when I found out I was like, oh my God, that's like big twister Rama mode for I'm like, oh my God like I it all of a sudden made sense and I had to like go and get more Lord, ounce of like I need to find out more about this thing now because like this is my role in this story and all that and it helps it helps to like, motivate me to want to to go to those like secret like laboratory research, branches.
51:44
To do the thing that's in there and like, how does that change the outcome of the ending?
Like those are all things that are super interesting that like every time that I boot up cognitive like okay, my goal is to go and do this three or four different things happen along the way that change that directory wildly, but I think every time that, that does happen, I feel like, okay, that's that's fine.
52:08
I have a new goal to shoot for and I'm equally as interested in exploring with this other, The thing that I didn't even intend to happen at all, has to offer.
Yeah.
Also like beating the game.
Does feel like a massive accomplishment?
52:25
It is.
It does.
You're like I can't believe I actually did it.
Like, hit crawls out and sees the Sun.
And I also feel like I've survived, I made it.
I will say that.
52:40
I feel like the ending maybe needs to linger, like a touch longer it.
I feel like it's over, very abruptly.
And it also, it's also in We asking mood, which kind of threw me for a loop, but but I think, like, if, if there were more like little kind of cinematics like that, interspersed there's a, there's a lot of interesting events that happen.
53:03
But if if like that kind of aspect was leaned on just a little more maybe for Cog mine to or super Cog, mind will get that.
But yeah, I think like the first time that I beat the game like having to escape the main doors of the of the top.
53:20
Floor of the compound with all of my parts blown off and I'm like bleeding and limping to the exit.
These giant robots are chasing me down, shooting their huge cannons, and I finally get to that exit and get that ending cinematic.
It was that was that was pulse raising, it was very much a Sense of accomplishment in that sense.
53:43
Yeah, someone reminds me of, like, kind of the narrative was called the machine stops.
This is like, for my dystopia, clad, but like it basically like it did, the premise is very similar where it's like, you're deep underground is this, you know, dystopian society.
53:59
And eventually the purpose is to break free and get it out of the surface and like that's I guess it's kind of a recurring common thing which is?
Yeah or like what's the ice ice train Snowpiercer?
Whether it's like you got to get your way.
From from one place to the other and you're going through and getting nicer or more advanced as you go you go through it.
54:21
And I feel like that's it.
The iso.
Oh yeah, I know that's a piercer Snowpiercer.
It's not, it's not called snow peers.
You're talking about the Train movie, the bad one. - many people like a lot.
Oh, maybe, I have no idea what you're talking about.
54:36
Never mind.
Polar Express, Polar Express.
The one with the the disembodied dead-eyed.
Tom Hanks, CGI monster.
Now, Snowpiercer and was that the one that had the molecular?
That's not how do you not know about Snowpiercer?
55:00
It's got Chris Evans.
Got Tilda Swinton.
Whoo it's got Ed Harrison it?
These people are present.
It Harris in the Rock.
I mean, come on.
Yeah, he's been proof of the rock.
Chris Evans is Captain America.
55:17
Huh.
Tilda Swinton is.
She's in stuff.
I don't know.
Actors names.
I don't I don't care about these.
She has an acute abdomen.
I don't care about these things.
I can't emphasize that enough celebrities are something.
55:33
I will never ever know about.
Yeah, that's fair.
Anyway, I'm surprised the place we haven't seen Snowpiercer.
I didn't particularly like it, but it seems like it was well, liked among the kind of people that we hang out with.
55:50
So I'm surprised that you don't even know about it.
I thought you're talking about monster train the game, but no, it's a movie.
I like, I'm like, 10 years old at this point I've already read.
This is my new number one game.
56:14
I think kind of unsurprisingly.
I think when Colin when you first recommended this to me ages ago.
Like you should play this game Cog mine.
I was like No, at first, I thought it was exact ronix game because you were, you not having a lot of those recently and like what kind of looks like a Zach Tronics game?
56:32
I don't know about this, but I think it's quick like consistent, which is a huge, by the way, a huge endorsement if it was at drawing.
So if you like Zach Tronics games, you'll love this and vice versa, probably.
But I think the, I was kind of mad on Cog mind at first, but the thing that really hooked me was like, Like yeah, camera row by running around shooting stuff and like there were some enemies that I was fighting and then out of nowhere, there were just these friendlies that came like bursting through a wall of like I'm here to help you and save the day come with us and we'll take you to to like our friendly faction layer and like, okay.
57:10
Sure.
And like, yeah, very surprised.
The first time you haven't really.
I don't think I didn't think that it was this kind of game, right?
And just the more, the more kind of like personality and like ass Attic World building that there exists here that we didn't get in sort of the stars or Dredmor, really.
57:31
I think just like catapulted it into like, this is, this is the best in class.
Traditional, roguelike, period.
I don't think that there's any traditional Road like that remotely comes close to this game in terms of its quality or it's handcrafted thoughtfulness and everything from like the diegetic.
57:53
Record like atmospheric sound design, but even like the little beeps and Boop's of like, interacting with computer Terminals and like, the Matrix style hacking stuff, it with something of the machines, all the week.
Yeah.
Like these Vortex reactors and stuff that just kind of sounds like you're walking through like a, like a furnace.
58:13
I love Home Depot, like all, like, weirdly all ticks all the right boxes for me.
And it's just this weird alignment of things that just line up perfectly.
Lee.
Yeah.
Like the graphics aren't perfect but I think for what it's trying to do it, like chaos dunks, it perfectly for me.
58:31
So this is my new number one game.
I was I was very excited when we pick this one and I think I will be very excited to see how the Cog verse evolves over time.
I think it's definitely a space to watch.
58:48
Is there plans for a cock mine too?
I mean, I like the kid, the very dedicated Community to the game kind of jokes and pokes and prods, the developer about it.
I don't I don't know that like there's any serious developments like this game is listed on Steam as Early Access, but this game is done like their.
59:06
I can't think of another thing that like you would need to add to make this game more.
I can think of three.
Sure.
But like for what it's going for right now.
Feature.
Good game system design wise, you could very easily release it as a finished product right now.
59:22
And yeah.
You know what it was that, like a year ago, easy.
But yeah, I think like, for me, ticks all the right boxes.
I don't think there's any serious plans for like a souped-up, like, to point at her like a cock mind, to version to come out anytime soon.
59:38
Just based on like the developers super open about it as like a game development like practices and like this is How game development for something like this works?
Stupid complicated.
Like I couldn't do it in a million years and I can only imagine that like if he tried to Pivot this to like a Super Nintendo level game, he would need like a full Studio to do so just because you'd have to write the whole thing from the ground up just to appease Wills disdain for anything, that's teeny tiny Graphics.
1:00:10
Yeah, I have this coming in at my number two game, still behind FTL.
Ftl's, a little bit more.
Of a, I mean, FTL Graphics is the same kind of like that.
The that feels much better.
1:00:27
No, no.
In terms of like FTL Graphics is the step up and Graphics that will could be looking for like a little bit more legibility.
It's a very cohesive look but it's not necessarily needing most legible.
1:00:48
I really like the depth of gameplay.
I like the feeling that you could go into a lot of stuff and that it would always it would be there.
There's no invisible wall at the edge.
There's if you go into this thing there will you might die.
1:01:07
It might get absolutely stomped but there is something behind every door.
I've been opened a lot of doors.
There was a lot of empty rooms.
Those are Hideout spots for when you need to cool off metaphysical door.
1:01:28
But I think FTL still has a more well-crafted total game narrative, but I put it about something like invisible ink because I think it has just more complexity of gameplay and depth of gameplay and I mean I haven't played it 4:00 but I absolutely could see myself doing that and not having plumbed the depths of it after that amount of time.
1:01:57
So I liked it a lot.
All right, and now for the correct answer.
Oh that's where the podcast has ended.
How did this happen?
Oh, well I guess we'll never know.
As I think the best framing I could put it is the one I know before we jumped on my podcast.
1:02:17
I said yeah it's just about as good as risky as of rain.
It's just about as good because you all love that game.
And I also thought his except for from a lot of critical problems that ones that I it was just what is funny is that I keep I point out all these Lumps and then I see both of you shaking your heads.
1:02:34
Yes.
Yes.
These are all things know my and so I think it's just so odd to me that they have somehow managed to get these top rankings.
But I give this game did not manage to hit my six out of ten threshold for recommending.
I even a 4.5 out of 10 because it was severely lacking in those critical things that were mentioned and this this in terms of overall rankings it looks like it puts it at number nine out, its ranked And three tie tied with swords of the Stars, the pits dins curse and just below risk of rain.
1:03:11
So yeah, 9 out of 16 games won't go where 16?
We've really the most podcast for a while, but yeah, I wanted to like it.
I really, I played this game.
Like I don't know a year or two years ago for just a little bit.
I was just like, nope, can't get into it and this time, I thought, okay, maybe if I, you know, I'm gonna watch more tutorials, I'm gonna have Scott.
1:03:31
I'm gonna have him Stream to me, show me the fun Sky show me what's so great about this, and he's like her and then I quick, there's something in there and I'm just like, okay.
Alright and it just never got into the, the point where I felt engaged, I tried, I really did.
1:03:47
But now the phone of COG mind comes from.
When you swap out, your Treads two wheels and what is called a half-track strategy.
Maneuver, in which case in allows you to carry a lot more stop.
Scott.
1:04:02
Do you like the Cog or the mind more?
I'm more of a cogman.
The Cog is, the factorio has a cog.
And obviously, it's a 10/10 game right there.
You know, based on what I know from from The Twist about the lore, I think I might might have to be on the Mind side a little bit, I don't know if that controversial.
1:04:21
I don't know if that makes me the bad guy in this story or if the robot controlling the facility that were in is the bad guy but I guess until will, you know?
Reads through the 100-page tone that is the Lord dump of this case, the Kabul or, yeah, I guess with some good games, we'll wait for the movie adaptation and then we'll get the real breakdown.
1:04:44
I mean, if the Creator ever were to listen to this, I wish.
I mean, I hopefully, you can take this, you know, and know that it's nothing personal, but he's gonna find, you're gonna wake up.
There's gonna be a Citrix broadsword in your pillow.
It's going to be 3 pixels but it'll be there.
1:05:02
I would just say I get it and like that you have a target market and that Target Market is not me you appeal very much obviously, to these two Dunces.
I mean, these are very entail.
Yep, it's a crazy thing though.
Is, if you are like Square in the bullseye dead center of the target market and I see, I see your presence.
1:05:21
I see how it didn't hook you, but I can, I can imagine just a very slightly different you and a very slightly different game.
And you just being like Oh, oh, it's one of those things where we'll get sway into a game making.
Yeah, it just like the big thing if it just had those two or three of those components that we talked about, it would have done that for me.
1:05:42
But the graphics thing is really is that two or three points at this would have gone up to a six point five, or seven point five out of ten and a seven point five out of ten that puts it at at.
I think one of the top like three games that we would have played but like it just didn't have it if you just your son's the breach, come on Tori FTL level.
1:05:59
Like that's just like a half Step Above words at Yeah, well maybe someday maybe, maybe they'll make this perfect game like I was saying and we can all look forward to that into the reach to.
In the meantime next week.
1:06:15
We're going to be playing another game with maybe.
Maybe these are the graphics rules looking for.
I think this is actually a half of yeah, this is the magic of low magic age.
It's a square squares moving around.
1:06:32
Turn based fog of war and to end to come back to the graphic earlier this week, that will nominated over Crypt of the necrodancer and Tiny Rogues, for whatever reason that I saw.
Oh, I better reasons I can tell you why.
1:06:50
Because, well, he's bullet hell.
It's a bullet hell.
Obviously, that's more threats.
Don't want to play those games and the other one, like the playing a game to the beat and like 50% of the players not getting past level one.
One, like I give that is novel but I don't like, it's like a very, maybe it's worth laying at some point just a little bit, but I don't want to put a whole podcast into it.
1:07:11
Just like the stupid mechanic of usable in a way that getting stung by a scorpion would be novel, right?
Exactly.
That's, I mean, it's just like, I get it.
I don't like, I don't like timing based games.
I like judgment based games and that's why I just like the bullet, hell sort of games.
I just, and I say that, but I love the bullet.
1:07:27
Having games released for a survivors, like, isn't know, maybe, I'm open to it in the future, but I prefer the one that we're playing.

1:08:01
But next week we're going to be we're going to be rolling for some initiative.
We're going to ideally having some weak little Wizards died on their first campaign session and maybe we will see The Return of Wills D&D character.
For our next episode, low magic age, I'm very much looking forward to it.
1:08:24
It did look like a D&D combat simulator and it's supposed.
Yeah, I think it's supposed to be basically based entirely around like version 3 point, something of D&D and I think we were playing like five fifth edition.
Is that right Edition?
Yeah.
I mean d and e is another.
1:08:40
I couldn't get into that.
So I'm a little bit worried but hopefully because it's all optimization and this is all the fighting.
Yeah fuck they were all playing.
That's what they see and be the worst thing are out there.
Here's a lord dropo another stupid character with his say, no, I mean no offense, so many enemies.
1:08:59
Kappa medicine, both cast episode of colleges like I do with that one boy.
Participant miles, will feel never know, you'll never know the fear of Jacques Rock pointing at.

Yeah, we need a we need I didn't think about it beforehand.
We need another bit that we do at the end of every episode.
