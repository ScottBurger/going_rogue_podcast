Hello again listeners and welcome back to another episode of the Grogpod Rogue Like podcast where on each one of these recordings we deep dive into the gnomish minds of rogue like games to find the sorcerer deep underground and then rank that sorcerer against all the other games that we've played.
0:56
At the At the end of our season of Roguing Madness, I am your highly voxelized host of the podcast Scott Burger, and with me in the other corners of our split screen mayhem are my Co host.
This is Will your wizard casting fireball non-stop.
1:14
And me, Andrew Hershman, shambling undead shadow of a living, sentient human.
And me, Colin, Jib, jab jab, jab.
I haven't known.
This week we are playing our listener requested episode and Minecraft Get Good Edition Barony released June 23rd 2015, almost almost coming in on that 10 year anniversary.
1:41
You can find this on PC and interestingly enough, on the Nintendo Switch.
This is a game development published by Turning Wheel Games, three full time developers who work together remotely from Washington, Tennessee and Australia.
1:57
Your average player of Barney has about 30-6 hours of game time in it, and Barney rolls in on our data set of popularity at the number 132 most popular Rogue like game with 7218 total reviews.
2:17
Andrew, you've just discovered a scroll labeled One Sentence Description of Barony.
What does it say?
All right.
Well, I'm still feeling a little bit rough, a little sick.
Definitely got that head cold.
Brain fog going.
I'm gonna give him my best shot In a not too distant future, a lone researcher travels space and time and receives A distress signal after which some interstellar you end up.
2:48
You're on a planet you see and but when you die, you, you come back, you return for an eternal amount of time.
All right, that bit is great.
I was hoping for some audible laughter that I I don't know where you're.
Going with this.
And he was.
Describing returnal Where's the Where's the Discord clapping button?
3:07
Anyway, all right, well.
Next.
OK, moving on, moving on, check it out.
So the game that we're Barony, which is, is it certainly is not devoid of contents and experience.
3:23
It is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler.
You got your different levels of dungeon, they're very well procedurally generated and they're populated by classic Dungeons and Dragons types, types of of creatures.
And through you know, there are many trials and tribulations and lots of options and things like the classes that you pick.
3:44
You pick a class, you pick a build, you go through, you level up, you loot, and you try to prevail over the dungeon.
And if you do, you certainly have my respect as as a gamer is quite the challenge.
Barony.
Fair enough.
4:00
Yeah.
And it is so named, yes.
Or it's it's it's storyline, which I'm sure we'll get into in a bit.
Yeah, we'll get into it right now.
Bam.
How about that?
I want to 1st get into it before we even start getting into it.
Is that the the scroll at the beginning?
4:17
The very first thing that you see in the game that explains the story?
It moves it.
It slowly reads the text and moves it while it reads it and I found that to be an extremely off putting start to the game.
What I.
Don't.
Even.
Remember that the text the text is moving from left to right while it it individually prints out words and it's in like ASCII font and it moves and I'm just like I can't read this and it's so slow and it only lets you skip the whole thing or watch it all the way in so I skipped the whole thing so I don't know what happens in the story.
4:53
I feel like that's a throwback to, like, your young kid.
There are certain things that we did in the past that because we didn't have the like computer skills for it.
And there are things that you don't need to do anymore now.
Well, you.
Can.
Sorry, I'm watching it right now.
5:09
You can just wait till it all prints out and then and then you can read it.
But.
I I get what you're saying.
I read very fast and that was slow.
So slow.
A little off putting and but I tend to agree.
I think it's probably a throwback to.
I think it's trying to warn you like David the.
5:25
Story.
I'm not sure.
The way the text like rolls and moves, it's trying to foreshadow the the presence of deadly boulders, deadly boulder traps that are ever present throughout this game.
With those you can push them off.
You can at least kind of hear them coming a little bit.
Well, I for one thought the introduction was I, I, I I was not personally personal taste was not perturbed by the text.
5:49
The text really got me excited to play this game, and it invoked this very Diablo, one type of a mystery and excitement about oh, I'm gonna venture forth into the the forbidden depths of this dungeon, of this place in search of the Baron, the ghost, the evil ghost of the the the Baron that was entombed at the bottom of this dungeon.
6:11
And I thought, I thought it was quite nice.
Well, it sounded like you were.
Initial gameplay experience didn't live up to that.
Well, it sounded like you were you were trying to get something in when we all dogpiled in at the same time.
No, it's funny that we're starting with the list of grievances at the very first thing that appears on the screen, and I have a feeling that this is just gonna be a perhaps a theme.
6:34
I only took two notes on this game and the first one.
I don't even normally take notes on games, but I opened up a thing to write down.
Text scrolling is awful because it annoyed me so much and it's literally the first thing you see when you start the game.
This is why the listeners requested us to review this.
6:51
I thought the the intro cinematic, which I guess it's just like there's just like 4-4 different artisanal or artisanal artistic screens that are, you know, they're very charmingly done in in a nice little art style of yeah, kind of telling the story of that.
7:11
You know there once was a town named Hamlet and it's a very colorful cute little standard medieval town.
And then Baron Herx Rose to power.
And then the next the next screen is this oppressive overlord standing over the the grimacing miners of the town who have been been such enslaved.
7:33
But I guess they they get mad and then bury the the Baron down in the mines.
But then skeletons and other demons start coming out of those mines and start attacking the villagers.
I think like that the art style of this, this little intro cinematic is has a lot of charm to it.
7:52
And I feel like there's a lot of that kind of charm that comes in through the other aspects of the game.
So I think, like, I think it kind of sets the charm tone pretty well in that regard, yeah.
It's definitely a charming game.
8:07
Which, thank God for that, because if it weren't for all that charm, I think it would have chased me off pretty quickly.
Mm hmm.
Yeah I mean after that intro cinematic it is it is a drop right in and and go get them tiger experience.
8:23
There is there is no meta progression as far as I can tell.
There's no like meta stuff that you're unlocking along the way.
It is just almost arcade mode.
You just drop in, you're you're good to go and you drop in to your first and probably the the Biome that you're going to see the most playing this game, the minds, which I don't know.
8:46
So we all individually got past the mines, right?
With the help of cheats, yes.
Yeah, we, we got to like the third Biome, I believe.
Well, yeah, Co-op, we did.
I don't think I ever got past the first first level of the second Biome by myself.
9:04
Ever.
Oh no, yeah, I think I got the 9th I wanna say.
And then I took a some haunted castle path.
And The Haunted Castle has a new novel, Way to kill you that I absolutely was bamboozled by.
Well, did you get good?
And just as a quick aside here, every time you die and you wanna or every time you want to leave the game and they quit, there's a you like some kind of a a a text, which is something like, oh, you mad, why not get good or something that's like really trying to patrol you, I guess.
9:33
I hear you.
What was it like?
Mad 'cause bad?
And then what?
That you had to click Get good to quit or something.
Well they're they're all kind of like that.
It's like, you know if if you quit, I'm gonna tell your mother you said a bad word and then your your quit button turns to poop or you know your return to game option is no, please don't, please don't say that.
9:51
And like, I get it.
I get like the the the attempt at the humor and like there were some of them that I was like and then others are just like, you know, didn't didn't even really read the text at all and I was just like clicking the button to escape.
10:08
I'm gonna go and test it right now.
If the game opens, let's see what random message we get, which of course this is a throwback to when many games was a tradition.
Smallest.
In games.
All right, Quit.
Did the little goblins hurt your feelings?
10:24
Quit.
There you go.
I mean, I feel like yeah, I.
Hear you, Will.
It's that's the last thing you want to see.
It's like with the star of Providence, I got a a tool tip after a a tough round and it was like, hey, don't forget to dodge the bullets.
I'm like you bringing me.
No, that that one that doesn't bother me so much.
10:43
It's it's specifically these like really like the 12 year old humor like jokes like like the the mother bad word poop.
Like, come on.
I don't know.
I think it's safe to assume that the developer who wrote these messages was not the one from Washington.
10:59
Because come on, we're watching Tony.
It's we're more polite than that.
At least we'll you know.
We'll blame it on the Aussies, yeah.
I think like this.
And especially if this, this game's aesthetic is.
I mean, I was kind of joking at the beginning.
11:14
Minecraft get good Edition.
But like from across the room, like, you really couldn't tell if this was Minecraft at first glance, 'cause it is so highly voxelized.
And I imagine that that aspect of like charm and or you know, the the aesthetic that they're going for is trying to grab some of that Minecraft audience.
11:33
And I could totally see like some people who bounce off of Minecraft for like, yeah, you know, I don't, I don't want to base build.
I just want to like go into dungeons and punch monsters like this is that.
And this is just like taking taking like that aspect out and just plopped it into I think like a lot of traditional rogue like aspects that we we have not really covered so much here.
12:01
Maybe vaguely with tales of magical, but stuff like identification scrolls and hunger meters and things like that.
Like, they're all traditional rogue like D&D tropes that like they're they're not like super common in Minecraft per SE, but well, I guess Minecraft has a hunger meter Anyway, what I think I'm trying to say is that, yeah, I think some of that aesthetic and what they're going for is trying to pull in that Minecraft audience.
12:28
And I think you see it with like the the online community as well.
Like there's a super active YouTube community around this game that like I think I can also understand from the aspect of online, online play and social aspect being the bigger draw for this than solo play.
12:50
Well, was it's funny that you you mentioned this cause at the top of my list of notes about this game is why not just play Minecraft?
Great question.
And actually, I've played this game in the presence of other people.
And multiple times people say, oh, you're playing Minecraft, I was like, well.
13:07
Actually I think this I think this is AI mean it.
It has a a surface similarity in Minecraft, but I don't think beyond the visuals that it's the same at all.
I wouldn't even know if you want to get real.
And it's like, oh you're it's it's 3 dimensional and you have a sword and you.
13:23
Can't jump?
The end.
No, yeah, yeah, exactly.
It's a 1Z level Minecraft dungeon explorer.
No, I mean like that's saying.
In terms of like when I'm playing Minecraft, like I the the same sort of like things in my brain are triggering as in this game, except for Minecraft has a million times more content and more Z levels and more interesting things.
13:40
That and and and this is just like the oh, you want the you're running through the mines, smacking A creeper sort of like this.
Thing has one in thing in common with Minecraft, and many things in common with a bunch of other games.
I don't think it's more like Minecraft than pretty much any other 2D top down game where you're running around and it's like real time.
14:03
Like it's only got the fact that it's block graphics.
You can't jump.
You can't explode.
Food is not that big of a thing.
It doesn't really matter that much I can think of something.
Farm you can't craft.
Right, exactly.
It's got less fewer features.
That's what I was trying to say exactly.
14:18
Fewer.
No, but like fewer Z levels.
The the the vibe of it is entirely different.
Like I don't think it's even useful to compare them.
Like they they're visually similar and that's it.
That's like saying oh this game has cartoon graphics therefore it's the same as a different game.
That's I'm.
14:34
Saying like big experience experience of playing it your.
Experience is wrong.
You're going, you're turning a corner, and there's a monster there.
You shoot it.
You're in Minecraft, you're doing the same.
You turn a corner, There's a a Franken, or the fuck, I don't remember.
The creatures are called the Frankenstein creature.
But a zombie?
14:49
He's coming at you and you're.
Smacking You're in the real Doom.
You turn the corner and there's a monster and you shoot it.
The original Doom is more like this game than Minecraft.
I think one thing for me that leapt out as far as like a a like, yeah, I think I think Colin is right in that there's like a 10 second visual similarity between this and Minecraft and then like you watch it for longer than that, you're like Oh yeah this is not Minecraft because I think Minecraft does melee combat a million times better than this.
15:22
And I don't.
I don't like, I don't even remember when was the last time we played Minecraft, like 15 years ago or something like we we.
All.
I mean, I put in like 100 or something hours with people during the pandemic.
More than 100, many, many hours.
15:37
So Colin, as someone who's played Minecraft more recently, is, is melee combat in Minecraft like a a worthwhile Ave. to explore, or is it just like just shoot everyone from range like this game?
Like when I played it, I got good armor.
15:53
And it's not, it's a it's it's not part.
It's not a main focus of the game.
It's like, oh, cool, there's a thing and you're like, maybe it'll hit me like, I don't, I don't feel scared of things anymore.
Like Minecraft is about exploring and seeing cool things and building cool things.
16:10
Like if you die, like, I have died in that Minecraft server that we have like 2 times in the last 50 hours.
I don't think that's true for Barony.
Like, I'm pretty sure I've died more recently than 50 hours ago, like 50 seconds.
16:30
The the way that you engage in combat like Minecraft doesn't.
It maybe has a better melee system, but you're not.
It's not a focus of it.
Like it's it's just a thing that they added in to make sure that you had it.
Well, so critically you know, Barony is, you know, this very traditional fantasy rogue like experience wherein of course at the very beginning is when you start a run, you create your character and you've got all these different classes.
16:58
There's some pretty unique classes, but you know all all the standard Dungeons and Dragons fare is is present, and when it comes to actually fighting creatures and you know, outputting damage that major interaction with the game world, your main choices are magic.
17:17
You know.
Traditional ranged weapons and melee weapons and then maybe as 4 you could say like you know conjuring and like you know recruiting followers and things, but like 3 main types of weapons, magic range and and melee.
And 1/3 of the combat in this game is pretty bad, and I'm kind of shocked at how bad it is, and perhaps there's some subtleties that I'm missing.
17:45
I have a vague recollection of there being a tutorial about like there was something about dodging maybe that I forgot.
About timing, it's like they all attack at the same the same interval, Shield timing like shield the thing and then hit them, then shield then hit and they all have a slightly different yeah rate at which they do that.
18:01
And this is going to sound maybe wild, but like for my money, I I don't think Eldridge is a better game.
But I think Eldridge somehow has better melee combat, and that's like, that's pretty wild.
And that's almost like by accident that it's.
Better.
I think that they made one single design choice that really is unfun.
18:20
They made it so that you move backwards much slower than you move forwards, which means that you can't do the, like, jump around kite.
Also, you can't jump, so you can't do the thing where you're like strafing around and maybe that like we could get used to it, but it deeply, like that's not how I expect WSDASWASD to work in a game.
18:45
So every time I'm like trying to kite backwards, melee hit and I'm like I'm so slow I just get creamed by this spider or whatever.
It's like, well, the answer would be like hit, hit, run away, do something like have your friends magic blasted or something and like the idea of turning around and running from an enemy as part of like the act of still combating it.
19:09
Like I I my brain was definitely either like you're fighting or you're running away.
And this is like, I'm really trying to continue to fight, which is very.
Weird, that is.
That is counterintuitive, definitely.
And I and I tried to embrace that design choice, that system, by playing the ninja.
19:25
And so this game is surprisingly twitchy.
Like in order to play the ninja you need to sneak up, attack.
You then need to do a 180 as quickly as possible and run away as fast as possible and like getting that.
Doing that consistent was tricky and it was admittedly satisfying when I was able to do it correctly.
19:42
But it is just I don't.
I don't think the melee is is quite there.
I was expecting something like mount and blade.
I was expecting something like chivalry.
I was expecting like pirates versus Vikings versus Knights like there and and initially I thought OK this is going to be a lot of shield game play and so I went into my first run with a shield build and just the the the the timing against the starting enemy the the the skeleton is it's so small like the the the the window to block and then unblock and attack.
20:19
And they do damage to you through the shield too, so they are chipping away at you, even if you're like getting the timing wrong.
And it's it's not again it's it's not necessarily an issue of like if the game's too hard, like it's fine for the starting enemies to be to do a lot of damage but like give me an opportunity to to like get a get a hit in.
20:39
I I yeah, I was just I.
Was really surprised.
By that.
I think a game that doesn't like, I was trying to think, what game does melee combat well?
And yeah, I think you'll like just made it out of like well, but yeah, there there's the crap.
But like, it's not it like it doesn't feel like a common experience that like first person melee combat is done well.
21:01
Like generally, like it seems like a very hard problem to solve.
Or it's like you know, it's it's like your Minecraft like very basic.
You run up to a spider and you're just like bap, bap, bap, bap, bap attacking it and like circle strafing around and like that's it.
And then yeah, like you know the 500 level stuff of like chivalry where you have like your gimbal animations of the arm you're ducking undercover and all that.
21:21
And like it's.
Like different directional.
Attacks and what have you.
I think a game that like what I was looking for from melee combat for this and admittedly like Barony is like almost 10 years old and this game that I'm about to mention just came out, but does melee combat much better is mortal sin.
21:38
It's a very aesthetic.
Oh yeah, sure, aesthetically interesting.
But anyway, like I've seen it, it it has like relatively simple melee combat.
It has like, you know, simple RPG style mechanics and loot swapping.
Like, I I had made the mistake of playing a little bit of that before this.
21:56
And then I was like always comparing my melee experience in Barony to that of like, man, you know, it'd be like really good if I could like hit the enemy and not die before I can like like punch him and.
Just even simple things like, OK, maybe you can outrange them and it's a matter of managing your distance between them.
22:15
Like there's there's like none of that.
There's no ability as as you were saying, Colin, like the oh, get around with the enemy and like, flank them.
Pardon me, there are flankings like if you if you attack, if if you attack an enemy that's like engaged with one of your allies, if you do extra damage, but like it's it's a huge miss and.
22:30
In fact, it.
Hasn't been addressed.
You can't like counter something like.
It'd be great.
Blocking doesn't.
They swing at you and you?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, you block at exactly the right point.
Perrying.
Sure, sure.
Even even if the even if the melee was just like boring, like what you're describing with Minecraft Scott, which I I've barely even played Minecraft, so I don't know, but like boring would have been acceptable.
22:51
And again, my my experience of playing the ninja was was was at times pretty fun because I was not.
I wasn't engaging so much with that not great melee system because I was having to with the stealth.
I was having to engage in this with the stealth system, which works OK in my opinion.
23:12
And it's very possibly and I've I've only played this game for maybe 6-7 hours.
So perhaps I am failing to see the subtleties of these melee systems and I'm you know, just I'm just lousy at it.
But I I I feel like if that is in fact the case and that I'm missing out on like YouTube tutorials that I need to watch if if they're, if they're if there are mandatory YouTube tutorials are like extra reps you need to get in to make the melee fun.
23:40
I mean, I went.
In a great design set up.
I went in like I was having problems, so I went into the bare need.
Discord and everyone there is super friendly.
And I was asking like, hey, I'm having some problem with, you know, understanding the Melee system.
They're like, yeah, just, you know, observe the attack patterns of the enemies.
23:56
And I'm thinking to myself, like, what attack patterns?
It's like, you know, the the, the first level, you know, you have rats, skeletons and spiders or the first Biome.
And you know the a rat will just like squeak up to you and it will just like attack, attack, attack, attack, attack nonstop.
24:12
And I'm just like it's and and I've I've put I don't know maybe like 1000 hours over all the Dark Souls games.
I'm like waiting for the attack pattern.
Where's where do I dodge roll out where's where's the opening here and.
Totally, totally.
And all of the all the starting classes, Barbarian, Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Merchant, Wizard, etcetera have difficulty tears associated with them.
24:37
The warrior who starts with a spear and a shield is listed as a beginner difficulty.
So I thought that's for me, I'm I'm a beginner mode, I'm gonna try that.
I don't think I ever got past the first level with the Warrior.
Here's a question.
Does a spear?
Does the spear have noticeably longer range than the other mega weapons?
24:54
I didn't really notice it, but again, I'm like I might just be in the mad 'cause bad category.
What's interesting under this listing here will would you agree that the wizard is difficulty level hard?
It's typically level is easy mode.
25:09
For sure it's the best class at least.
OK, I I looked at a bunch of tier lists and like you know, some disagreement about if it's A or S tier, but like it's unfair.
Yeah, let's sorry, you know maybe let's move on to some more positive things.
Magic.
So again 33% of of the combat melee combat is a write off.
25:28
All right that's that's done.
Moving on.
Hey, spell casting.
That's pretty fun.
There's lots of neat fun voxel effects happening.
The feedback is good.
When you kill enemies they explode in exciting ways and like the sound effects are cute and it's all working together to give you that what is, to me at least, comparable to like a good FPS experience.
25:49
Like you're you're you're you have these weapons and they feel powerful and you feel like you have agency in the world.
And I only played with the wizard.
Seriously.
Like today and I sound pretty good, pretty good time with it, but but you all had more experience with it 'cause you were kind of running exclusively Wizards A. 100% Wizards after I didn't realize it's the best class by far, at least for like I don't have the DLC unlock so there's a lot of the other better classes.
26:12
But unfortunately with the magic I think at one point I got to level 21 so I had I had all the spells.
Level 100 of the casting I think.
So you get the the end spell is domination to make someone you know your bitch, essentially, and tell them what to do.
But like, but across all the spells, there's nothing that gives you more bang for your buck than just the very first spell you get.
26:33
Which is fireball like all like they're hey, you can slow your enemy down.
Oh you can put them to sleep.
Why the hell would I want to do that?
I want them dead.
I want the experience.
I want to get the loots.
Like there's no point in like doing anything other than killing them.
And that requires doing maximum damage.
26:49
Now some things do have, like, resistances, but like, yeah, just fucking fireball everything.
And the D&D experience?
Yeah, and then once you run out of mana, that's why you have the magic staff, to just ZAP them with whatever you know you need to.
So it's just like that's the that's the combo I guess.
27:05
Yeah, it's unfortunate that right out of the gate you with that class are are, are, are given a dominant strategy.
It's like, well here's the best spell you could ever want.
Like no need to experiment or like have fun or engage with like any of the the spell progression that that that is unfortunate to hear.
27:25
There's no AOE.
There's like, there's like, all the spells are like, like just like the arrows, essentially, they fly out and they hit a single target and they like, you'd be cool if like, hey, here's your area of effect one and oh, here's the one that fires in like a beam like a flamethrower in front of you.
Or like the one that shoots an area around you or a shield that like, but none of that.
27:44
None of.
That.
Well, no, not true, because Collin's Healer class was AOE.
Oh yeah, but that's Healing Spell.
You're right, yeah.
Got.
Him.
You got me good.
There, that's not an attack spell.
That's not the same.
Yeah, no, no, totally it is.
I I appreciate the joke Scott.
28:01
That's like ironically the the healing spell has the AOE whereas that's normally associated with doing damage primarily or or or at least that's the first thing that comes to mind I should say.
Yeah and sorry I should clarify I don't know if I spent a play does the Mystic I think or somebody who has like it's like spells but also a hand crossed spell So I I don't think I yeah the arcanist I I don't believe I played the.
28:26
Arsonist.
Typically the arsonist.
The arcanist.
Anyway.
So yeah, but what?
Hmm.
Yeah, interesting.
Interesting, but.
Yeah, I mean, I I played.
Miles more engaging and also you feel since you're when you're playing with magic, you're not just, you know, getting pounded into the dirt in your first fight.
28:48
So that automatically makes it a more, you know, enjoyable experience, right?
Out of the gate well well range specifically because the arcanist has they have a a a sword.
They have a a crossbow with fire bolts that you can launch at people.
They have a a magic staff that can like open stuff and they have some some spellbooks what's so a couple things that I I like about this game.
29:11
You know you Andrew you're mentioning like the magic system.
There's like an interesting aspect of like, you know when you get like magic tomes on the off of the ground, if your intelligence level is low enough that you can't learn it, you can still cast from it, which is neat.
And the arcanist, I think.
29:27
Well, like you can you can learn the two spell books you start with, But like your, you know, Intelligence might not be high enough for all of the spells, but you can still cast them, which is cool.
Yeah, and some of the spells are as as you say, there are spells that you memorized and then there are spells that are being cast from like spell focuses.
29:45
So like if you if you have the book, as you said or if you have a magical staff and that that whole system is something that you know you see in other games.
I feel like it was well presented and like functional and like pretty easy to grok.
Like which spells are coming from what sources?
30:03
And you know, having to manage those different items, like for example, the Staffs will like break down at a certain point.
And it's, yeah, isn't pretty, pretty neato I think.
The other thing the other thing that I really like about this game is identification systems.
30:20
And this is something that I I really hate about most traditional rogue likes is like you pick up a thing that's like this is an unidentified ring and in order to identify and like to some extent Diablo also like in order to identify you have to use a scroll of identify on it Bing oh you've discovered this as trash great waste of my time.
30:39
But instead, you have like an appraisal skill that's like you pick it up and in your backpack a little magnifying glass will just like, rub over it.
Be like, ah, yes, I've discovered this is a cursed ring.
Great, throw in the trash.
But like, I don't have to spend an action to do that.
And like, while I'm doing that, it's like passively upgrading the skill.
30:57
And it was, it was fun to have Colin as like, our dedicated identifier, man, yeah.
Your class, you're playing like one of the American Pickers.
You're just like grabbing all the trash and like looking at it through like one of those little I monocular things.
I got a guy.
31:12
So I will say that like first of all I think that I'm sure we'll get into it but I thought the multiplayer was a lot more fun of an experience than single player and and part of the other thing is like, so I too chose Warrior as the first thing that I picked and you have basically no identification skill which means that you can't level your identification skill really like maybe you or it's it's hard to do it.
31:40
So like I didn't even really understand how the system worked the first time I played because it was like, well, I just can't identify anything and it makes me really think that they should more strongly push you towards some class as the first class that's like just adventurer, you've got well-rounded thing and that like teaches you what the things of the game are.
32:06
It should have an OK identification ability, should have a way arranged weapon thing, just like a little bit of everything and it should be bad at all of them a little bit.
And so you don't play it, you don't play it beyond like the first couple of times because like well, it's not good at any one thing.
32:24
So you.
You can't go super.
Far with that, but Colin is a great idea.
Did you learn those things from the training Academy?
What things the the the the series of tutorials?
I mean, I learned how identification works, but I didn't.
Like once I started playing the actual game, I'm like, well, I don't understand how are you supposed to level this up?
32:47
You level it up by identifying objects, correct?
I I that's as far as I can tell, that's how you do it.
As far as I know I have.
No identification, skill.
You can't identify some things.
You can't level it up.
So, I mean, that's how I ended up dying in the first run that I did.
33:05
Is I just, on a whim, equipped like a lock pick or no, I was like, it was like a gem, like a cursed gem.
And I was just like, I don't know how I'm just putting stuff on.
It's like, well, now I can't unequip this.
33:21
It's like, well, how am I supposed to know?
So I was like, I basically can't can't find out any of the things that I'm picking up, if they're good or not.
And that was a very unfun experience as compared to when we all played together.
I'm like, you guys are just like leaving stuff on the ground.
33:37
I'm like, let me pick all of this up and then at the end of it, like, here's all of your good loot that I identified for you.
And I found that very, that was fun.
That was.
For sure the multiplayer like allows you to have a run where you are engaging with more of the systems and the systems are kind of complementing each other and you get a more full-fledged fun.
34:00
I I was describing it to someone today as like a chaotic fun experience 'cause it's pretty, it's pretty off the wall wild and sincerely pretty enjoyable.
But Scott, you mentioned the tutorial.
We need to talk more about the tutorial and how.
34:17
Oh, but before you do that, Andrew, you've just been killed by a boulder.
Oh no, not again.
Well, I got to, I got to mute the podcast or the music I'm listening to.
So I wanted for that very specific cue, which I'm really torn about the traps, but I'm sure we'll talk more about that in general.
34:35
I like traps.
Often times they're kind of underutilized in tabletop games.
And you know, once you get used to the boulders, it's kind of exciting.
It's kind of fun.
Good to outrun a builder.
Anyway.
The tutorials, All right, so I have a question.
34:51
How many of the tutorials did everyone?
I think I did 10.
Mandatory one.
I think I did 10 of the tutorials all.
Right, stop the intro 4. 10 tutorials.
I think there's 1212, there's 12 or 14 total and like that.
35:06
Is too many.
You got to, you got to, you got to spread them out or something.
You got to figure something out. 12 is ridiculous and real quick.
Sorry Scott, I got it.
This is very important.
Before someone says Oh well, your attention span is just, you know, too short or oh you're you're not, you're not putting in the effort to enjoy a game.
35:24
If you die during a tutorial, which is very possible it happened multiple times, probable you gotta restart that tutorial module.
Give me a break, don't waste my time.
What are you doing?
Game.
Yeah, that that was super.
35:41
That was extremely frustrating.
Like I would be playing, I'd be playing this on the bus, on the Steam deck and it like, OK, I'm putting myself in a bad position by doing this.
So this is Mia Culpa here, but I'm playing this game on mute, on the bus, on the Steam deck and like you know, going in like reading all the placards on the walls and like like, hey, this is how you do this thing.
35:59
OK, great.
Walk down this hallway and pull this lever to open the door.
Pull the lever, A boulder comes down and rolls over me.
Like was that supposed to happen?
Like and then I have to like go back to the beginning which is, I don't know, maybe like a 45 second restart.
36:15
I'm just like, I got to wait, like I got to go through the whole thing again and going through ten of these tutorial realms like so that.
So there is there is, you know, you you boot up the game and there's an option like start an adventure and like go to the tutorials directly.
Or when you start a game like you can go off to the side to like a little tutorial, the hall of tutorials kind of.
36:35
And you can go like 1 by 1 to see what's available.
Because there's like a shit load of game mechanics in this game.
Like there's a lot of stuff going on.
There's summoning.
There's like, NPC monster management.
There's magic bartering, alchemy.
There's, yeah, like merchant bartering.
36:51
There's like all the stuff that you can think of doing in like your standard D&D tabletop session is here, except if you die, you have to start the whole tutorial over again.
And you know, the tutorials themselves, like, aren't super long.
They're like maybe 5 minutes each if you know what you're doing.
37:07
But the fact that like there's a, there's still an.
Hour, right hour of tutorials.
Folks, yeah.
And you know, if you are, one thing that like really bugged me was like, I'm going through, I think it was The Alchemist one.
You're going through The Alchemist one.
And there's like a lot to learn.
There's a lot of potions and there's a lot of reading of stuff in the walls.
37:25
And you open up, you open up one gate and a spider is coming out and chasing you.
And you're like, OK, throw, throw the potion to to stun them.
Like, OK, I got that part run around the corner.
I'm like, OK, what do I got to do next?
And I have, like, this panicky sense of like, I don't like, I'm on a clock here, 'cause the spider's gonna go unstunned here in a minute and come around the corner and eat me.
37:44
What does this thing do?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
And then I fell in the pit and died like, OK, let's try it again.
And eventually, like, you know, you get to the point where like, OK, take the OR take the potion of levitation, you're walking over this chasm and then you're doing another thing.
38:00
It's just like it's too much.
It's like there's too much stuff.
And I don't want to get good during the tutorial.
Like I appreciate the tutorials that are there.
I think like if the element of death.
The tutorial is for.
Getting good?
Yeah, exactly.
You shouldn't have to get good to do the tutorial.
38:16
I think the fact that there's a like your best time for the hall of tutorials is is kind of a warning sign of like, am I supposed like is this supposed to be a challenge?
Like normally we call out when two games do tutorialization very well.
I think this game is trying to do it well, but it's making it too too difficult.
38:35
Like the difficulties getting in the way of me learning the systems and I think the systems here are interesting.
The Alchemy 1.
Like you know you have your amblek and you're like combining water with poison, and like you know you're making like Thunder potions, like this is cool.
38:51
I would love to learn more about this without the fear of having like to die and then restart the whole thing all over again, and I feel like I'm just totally forgetting the whole system.
I agree.
And I think on one of the very first tutorials, yeah, it is similar experience.
I was like, I was like, wait, did I miss something?
39:06
I thought there was maybe another thing to check and I, like, backtracked.
And then I got like shot by an automated like turret or something and died instantly.
I was like, oh, that's still there.
Like, why?
OK, what?
Time to time to go to the checkpoint.
Oh no, back to the beginning.
Yeah, it's there are.
39:24
Look, I realize I appreciate that there's a lot of information for the game to give you.
But you, if you part one of the, dare I say it, responsibilities of the game, of the designers is if you have a lot of information, you need to find a way to organize and to dole out that information that is palatable and what the systems they have here is not palatable.
39:48
Well, not not palatable in In what sense I might fight you on this.
Pardon me, it is not easily consumed in a timely fashion.
It is it is frustrating.
It's time consuming.
It's it's not a good set up there should probably be I, I don't know like a tutorial dungeon or something where it's like it lets you play and enjoy the game in between the learning moments cause hey I I.
40:16
I'll admit it like I'm a I'm a meathead FPS guy, and as soon as the tutorial pops up, I'm immediately, immediately I feel like a grade schooler, and I'm in a class that I don't have a subject I don't like.
And I'm like, oh great, here we we.
Don't know if you like it.
Well.
Like, that's why.
40:32
Like that's why.
I defaulted that, but yeah, it's.
Gonna layer it in.
Indeed, you got it.
You got it layered in.
Because that way you you get a taste of the game.
Do you like the game?
Oh, you kind of like it a little bit.
Like all the little what?
Do you like the gameplay?
I think it's doing well, yes, yes, absolutely indeed.
I agree wholeheartedly.
That being said, you can probably get away with like maybe the first couple of tutorials and then like when you start doing runs and you're curious about another subject, you can pop back out and go to something.
40:59
That's what I ended up doing.
I did like the first three tutorials and then I played for a bit and then I went, all right, well let's check out spell casting.
And so then I did the.
So I suppose you can kind of self manage and figure it out.
But anyway, I think we've talked enough about this.
Not great tutorials.
The problem there's, I think there's a problem here where like there's a lot of cool stuff in this game, but I never get a chance to interface with it, 'cause I keep dying in the 1st 5 levels and then I have to like repeat the whole process all over again going back to the start and being under levelled and like the like.
41:36
The aspect of commanding like large armies of dudes like doesn't happen that often.
And I feel like Andrew, like you, you weren't on the on the show when we covered streets of Rogue, but did you ever like go back and and toy around with that at all?
A teeny tiny bit.
A teeny tiny, so like a.
41:52
A major component of that is like.
Followers and you recruit.
People, right.
Well, like emergent gameplay, I guess, where like you pick a class and it's not even remotely that's the same aesthetic here.
But like you pick a class, it's, you know, there's a lot of like hustle and bustle going on and there's like different systems that are, you know, available to to like noodle and and interact with.
42:11
And seeing how those systems like, oh this thing is on fire over here and it caused like a gas explosion and blew up this whole wall like like like you were saying like managed chaos in a way.
And I feel like managed chaos made was like the most fun part of this game when we were.
42:30
So we we tried doing a a split screen session and an online Co-op session and our split screen session was three of us, which like I'm I'm, I'm willing to like put this on me.
Where we were using, I don't know like original Xbox 360 wired wireless controllers.
42:49
And there was for whatever reason, a button press was creating a second character that was controlling 2 characters at the same time, which was not not the greatest experience, but after what was it like 30 minutes of?
Yeah, it's a 30-40, yeah, 45 minutes.
43:06
It was like.
Ridiculous.
Tinkering with the controls again, I'm I'm putting.
I'm putting this on me because I think my controller is just.
Old it it was, it was definitely as soon as we like start integrated the keyboard as the key element 'cause we tried all combination of controllers like we it did.
Really.
We entered 2 wired controllers and a keyboard, yeah, and that was the the winning the winning ticket, but.
43:27
But there was like once we finally got that going, I feel like there was, there was an element of that kind of split screen, controlled chaos that I haven't felt in like a long time of like, Oh my, you know, like the, the, the couch Co-op kind of nature of it I felt was a immediately way more fun than just playing by myself and playing on mute on the Steam deck.
43:49
Not the best experience, but like, yeah, I think having having like multiple people in a situation where like, oh, this thing is happening, you you can kind of see it.
It was like, it felt very much like a golden eye moment of like, oh, I'm watching this other person's screen.
Showing your age, Scott?
44:08
Perfect dark moment, Turok.
Question mark.
Where like, yeah, being able to see like, OK, Will's over here.
He's doing this thing and then like, Colin dies and he's using his ghost to scout ahead and we're like all this information, like, OK, like this feels, this feels more like what the game was trying to do and I feel like.
44:25
That just fundamentally easier.
Yeah, it was way easier and I think it like it really came to a head when we did four player Co-op online where everyone had their own monitor, everyone had their own mouse and keyboard that felt like this.
OK, this is the way to play it.
44:41
Yeah, I would not play this game single player again, but I would play it with the three of you totally like that was an enjoyable experience.
I liked that game.
I didn't.
I did not like the single player version.
And there was like craziness that was going on of like, you know, someone running out of food.
44:57
So we had to like scour the level for food to give them.
And then the Minotaur was chasing us and and then the.
ZAP Brigade.
The ZAP brigade that came in to save the day and I don't know.
What was?
Owned it.
I don't know.
45:14
I don't.
Know what triggered this event?
But the fact that I had only seen something like this once in maybe like 10 hours, 1012 hours of play was like, I want more of this.
This is like the kind of streets of rogueness, like mania that I was looking for of like there's there's like crazy stuff happening and I'm just like barely keeping it under control.
45:35
Like, yeah, sneaking in the shadows and managing hunger levels and scrolls of identification are OK, but, like getting chased by the Minotaur and then having the army of zaps come around the corner and, like, literally ZAP it to death was like, whoa, fun.
And then after that, we're we're in the transition zone from finally getting out of the mines.
45:53
And do we go to the swamps, or do we see what's this buzzing sound behind this wall over here?
Mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Hmm, a teleporter to a secret level, you say?
Sure.
Let's try this.
What's the worst that could happen?
Oh, getting sent, getting sent to the underworld where you have all sorts of like islands of teleport shrines and shadows flying around attacking you.
46:22
This this was another thing that I thought was super fun because it was so unexpected And like my expectation was OK, we'll go to the swamp and then after that we'll we'll kind of continue along the same progression.
But having this kind of like zaniness pop up out of nowhere was was a pleasant surprise.
46:42
And I I wish I had gotten more of that up to this point.
But I felt like our our adventure in the underworld realm was a lot of fun.
But eventually you know we were like, all right we're getting rolled here let's go back to the swamps, go back to the swamps.
46:59
Eventually we'll test out the do not pull switch that.
Worked out pretty well.
But we had the Zaps with us.
Fortunately, we saw the Zaps.
Or did the Zaps get got?
I just went to spiders.
I think the.
Zaps.
Most of the Zaps were dead, yeah.
Indeed we had.
I think we had maybe one or two leftover.
But anyway, yeah, we fought a giant army of spiders, which was triggered by the Do Not Disturb.
47:19
At some point I as a drunken ninja, I just consumed alcohol.
Because I had the hunger meter.
I was given the job of lock picking a treasure chest, which I thought was fun.
It's like, well, I'm pretty buzzed, but I'll give it a shot.
And after a few tries, yeah, all sorts of fun.
47:35
These all these random, zany cool, unexpected events, colliding and interacting and like a cool emergent gameplay experience.
And does anyone remember how that run ended After after we conquered the Minotaur?
After we we were rescued by the ZAP brigade?
47:52
After we we we traversed the Underworld.
What then happened?
Well, it's important to know that once the Minotaur died in the mines, that did not preclude the Minotaur from coming back in the swamp indeed.
The Minotaur came back and got his revenge, which even when we died, that was fun.
48:08
It was like, oh, what a fun fitting.
Like, sort of.
It's that story, that emergent story, that I love to see in a in a good.
Yeah, we were all separated.
That was that was the problem.
Like I think one one of us was like far away at the three of us were at the somebody.
My real I could have.
I could have chased it down.
48:24
But I was weighed down by the chest of your shit, and I was trying to get away, and I was like, oh, I'll cross the water and then he will.
Maybe he won't be able to swim after me because some of the enemies won't go into water, but he can levitate across water.
So he did, in fact, catch me.
Would you expect nothing less from a three story tall minotaur that breaks the ceiling as he walks around?
48:45
Not only that, the Minotaur I found out can levitate, he can levitate.
Oh.
Just like straight up regularly like I use my I use.
I bought the DLC.
I got.
I play.
I was playing vampire.
I used the levitated bill.
I was like a creature.
You cannot, you cannot follow me into the night.
49:01
I can go places where Oh my God, second maybe only to the Yeti.
Talk about indicating your age.
The Minotaur is an unstoppable and he absolutely will not stop until you are dead.
And that is both Tupa is, is both equal parts of frustrating and exhilarating.
49:22
Like when you get away from the Minotaur, it feels great.
When he comes out of nowhere and squashes you instantly, that's that can be a bad feeling.
But you know it's you kind of, with a game like this that's sort of what you're signing up for, right?
49:38
It's like it's gonna be ultra violent.
It's gonna be it's gonna be super.
What's the term?
Yeah, Insta, death is going to happen.
And that is kind of unfortunately part of the agreement when you go in, like you can't have those highs without those lows.
49:55
Yeah, I.
Just wish that, like when you died and you restarted, it was just like, OK, oh, it's the mines again.
Great.
Like.
If 100%.
If there was like even a like a pallet swap of like it's the blue mines and there's like the.
Wet.
Mines Yeah.
50:10
Like, yeah.
Like that's another thing that I I.
Agree wholeheartedly.
Yeah, where it's like you know, there's a little bit of the just the a little bit of spice to that just so that you know I can run the game for like 2 hours and like oh OK, you know, not have like the exact same.
50:27
Experience, yeah, Which is surprising since there is so much content in this game.
Like it's it's kind of surprising that there isn't more variety in the starting level that would that would really help and would would help ease the the the the the feel badness of dying and having to start over again like and it goes back to you know the point I've made many times which is at the at the core of a good rogue like is randomization meaningful randomization and that would really help the constant restarts and constant more palatable and more exciting if there were more random beginnings and events happening to spice up that those first couple of levels.
51:09
Well, as a as a counterpoint to that, I'd say that like the idea I I think once you you die to a novel thing like once or twice.
And the idea is you just never did die to that thing again.
Right.
Like the boulder.
Like there's this one channel that goes to the teleporter room.
51:25
Oh, you you run down there, you learn.
Oh yeah, there's just a channel of boulders and you just you, you know that they're coming.
And so like that you just never do that again.
And like everything you do, like the the mimics, you learn that.
OK, OK, that's a possibility.
You learn all the weird, stupid ways to die and then you hopefully never die that way again.
51:43
Like, I know that.
And there's just like, you need a whole bunch of unique ways to do this.
But like, the haunted castle I was at was level 21, legendary, almost everything.
I'm just, I'm feeling extremely overpowered and like nothing can withstand anything that I'm doing.
And I'm, I'm walking, walking out to leave.
51:58
I've looted the place.
I'm like, oh, there wasn't anything here.
OK, well, of course they're going to they're going to have like 20 ghouls come up and just Sprint at me from all directions.
And it's just like there's no amount of fireball that doesn't have AOE that I can do to like carve a path through these guys.
And so it's just like, OK, well, now I know that if I ever go to the haunted castle, there's going to be 20 ghouls that spawn as you like.
52:19
It's just like the the point I'm making here is that you eventually never like you in a whole run.
You basically always get a little further every time.
And so we're in the the the beginning phase where you're repeating a lot, but once you get the 10/15/20 hours I'm sure you're getting, you're progressing really far and then you're not seeing the first zone quite as often.
52:40
And so that sounds about right.
I I don't think it's like a fun thing though, to like have stupid shit kill you.
But you know, that's what this game is.
It's not fun, I mean.
The real, the real problem I think is not that you see the 1st realm a lot like I'm going to you know what we got to get it.
52:57
Got to get the obligatory Slay the Spire at least once per episode is when you're starting Slay the Spire or other rogue likes in general.
Let's say Hades because it's on the mind because Haiti Two came just just came out.
You see the 1st.
Biome a whole lot as you're bad and you're getting good, but the first Biome or the first stage or whatever is fun in and of itself.
53:23
Yeah, that's another way to do it.
Yeah, so really guys are having fun.
Wherever you are, that's fine.
I think the the biggest problem, unfortunately, Barony, is that the you are.
You feel your lack of power.
53:38
When you're at a low level, you have lack of options, you have a lack of survivability.
It's just not as fun and you're in the most boring blend of the environments is like, ah, it's a dungeon with rats and skeletons.
It's like, cool.
This has been done.
53:55
Yeah, and I think I I wanna call out like we we kind of dunked on Shattered Pixel Dungeon a long time ago.
And the more that I was playing Barony, like, I went back into the Google Sheet and I started like upping Shattered Pixel Dungeon's rank.
So I'm like, you know, like maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.
54:15
And I think like, well, also we played it on on phones at the time too, which probably wasn't doing it much much service.
But like I was like, you know what?
Like the level design, like the the random like level layouts of Shattered Pixel Dungeon gave me more agency of like opening a door and be like, OK, what do I got to work with here?
54:34
I've got grass to break up line of sight.
I've got like ways to like close the door and wait for an enemy to open the door and I get a sneak attack on him, like, ha, I have options.
And then coming back to Barony, which thematically very similar, it's, you know, obviously real time versus turn based, but it felt like it just didn't have any options and it was just like OK, you know, the the first level in Shattered Pixel dungeon.
54:58
Again, a very kind of, like, didn't like grimy dungeony kind of mine experience, but I feel like there's more flavor and more interesting stuff happening.
Like, oh, I can see that this room here is clearly a trap.
I'm not gonna go into this thing that has like a bunch of poison gas that's gonna kill me.
55:16
Or like crucially, I don't think any like did any of us try this of like luring enemies in bear any over traps that we knew were there and have the trap kill them?
Fireball just killed.
Everything.
I think I did that.
Oh no, wait, that was to one of my followers who got crushed about Boulder.
No, I think one time, yes.
55:35
I tried it a couple times, it only worked like once.
Yeah, I think it happened to me just.
On accident.
By accident.
So I'm glad you're bringing this up, Scott, cuz I wasn't totally sure how to explain how to how to state this until you brought it up previously.
I mentioned, hey, there's a lot going on in the game, but it's all these different systems.
55:55
There is a lot of it, but it's all kind of ankle deep.
You know, I I wish it was.
There was a little bit more interest and a little more interaction between the systems as you're saying.
Things like a chatter pixel dungeon where it's like the doors can be used to your to your advantage.
56:14
The traps can be used to your advantage, which technically they can be, but like they don't really seem very user friendly to do that.
I I was shocked that there was like no option to extinguish torches from a distance.
I was shocked.
There was no way to light things on fire with the fire sources.
56:30
There was a lot of like kind of basic logical gameplay jumps that I've seen in other games that that weren't in Barony, and I was kind of surprised if there was.
A if the game.
Presents.
Itself, you would not be able to pet it.
Indeed, if there was a dog in Barony you would not be able to pet it.
56:48
The the game I think is trying to be.
I think somewhere in the design document it probably mentions being an immersive SIM, and it's not quite to that level because there's not that there's there's not enough like interesting player driven problem solving.
57:07
I guess you can break down a door when it's when it's locked, like that's technically a thing that you can do in an immersive.
You know what it reminds me of?
It reminds me of like the Skyrim style.
Like you use the thing more and you level up that skill as you use it.
More aspect.
Which like like swimming.
57:24
Yeah, like you know and you know you you jump into like a a river or something, you're bobbing up and down.
It's like, oh you're swimming increased.
And I will say like this game's animation effects are very fun and charming.
I think the UI is is very good for what it's trying to accomplish.
And you know you have like a cute little duck symbol like duck for swimming that pops up and you're one pops up to A2.
57:44
Very satisfying.
But like in service of what?
Like, is there a way that I can beat the game by, like maxing out my swimming?
Not that I'm aware.
Of swimming useful at all.
I think it's just.
Like ground?
I don't think you can, right?
Swimming is an inconvenience in the biomes that have water, so if you're good at swimming, you are less inconvenienced by it, which is not great in my.
58:09
Opinion There may be more.
I mean, there's an amulet of water breathing, and so I'm assuming that later they're in a Biome we didn't get to.
There's a water world, but I don't know how that would work 'cause there's not AZ to.
I mean, I guess you.
Yeah, you you do dip down 1 to get into the waters.
Well, I imagine there's probably monsters that could.
58:27
Well, I'm scrolling.
Let's.
Assume let's give the game the benefit of the doubt and at some point swimming becomes interesting.
I'm I'm willing to give that to Verity.
Like, yeah, maybe, maybe at some point, but for the majority of players this is probably going to be their only interaction.
58:46
With it, yeah.
I mean I feel like the there's there's something, there's something missing about the the level design that like it just doesn't have that element of like yeah environmental puzzle solving.
Like I think you see it in Dungeons of Dreadmore a lot.
59:01
You see it in Shattered Pixel dungeon, Eldridge to some extent all previous or yeah all previous episodes, we haven't gotten to it.
But Rogue Fable 3 is another kind of similar dungeon crawler.
Traditional rogue like game dungeons, goblins, traps, etcetera, exits randomly placed.
59:17
But there's more interesting stuff to do on the level I guess more, more cool set dressing I guess is what I'm looking for.
Being able to yeah, like where's, where's all the explosive barrels that I can blow up and like have those create holes and then like the monster drops down the hole.
59:34
Kind of the thing like.
I I I hear you.
I I just wish, yeah, I wish there was a little more with some of these these systems.
Maybe that's including the levels in.
In general though, I was pretty impressed with the the procedural generation.
It felt pretty like organic and generally interesting to explore.
59:56
However, there are way too many closets, doors that lead to nothing.
There's way too many.
I'm gonna break down this breakable wall and it leads to nothing.
Or it leads to a path that, like, I could already access.
Maybe that gets better later in the game.
1:00:13
I was also like, I was really missing, like any type of like, invisible walls or hidden walls.
That's a Dungeons and Dragons classic.
The secret door.
The secret invisible door.
And especially in like that first level I was, I was, I was really craving that.
Like I would, you know.
1:00:29
Check the whole level and be like I I wish there was something cool to find or like, oh, this one torch.
Now I'm just like throwing out all sorts of goofy ideas, but you know, again, just a little extra level of of complexity in the level design I think really push this game to the next level.
1:00:45
Well, were there, Andrew, were there any workshop mods that that address that?
Well, most of them are broken because of one of the latest updates.
Great news, the Seinfeld mod works where it plays the Seinfeld music Sting When You Die.
I got that one to work.
I got the one that replaces the soundtrack with.
1:01:03
There's so many of those mods where it's just like it's just a soundtrack ripped from a different game.
What There was 1 graphics mod that I tried out and it like turned off pretty quickly because it wasn't to my liking.
There are quite a few workshop mods that are quite sophisticated, but I was too lazy to try to figure out how to get them to work with with the new update or the latest update.
1:01:25
There's one that turns the game into like a sci-fi game which looks.
Really cool.
And then the other one I was eyeballing is just like, you know, it's basically just like fan made DLC.
Like, you know, more items, more levels, more stuff.
Did anyone play with the DLC?
1:01:41
No.
I was pretty underwhelmed by it.
I gotta say it was fun playing as like the the, the, the, the monster races, but I was kind of hoping for them to be like really OP and they and they weren't that OP.
I guess generally I wouldn't say they're like a rip off, but just like I was, I was hoping for a little bit more and perhaps, I'm sure there's probably some DLC content in the later levels that I need.
1:02:07
Yeah I mean it's a it's a good good thing to point out because I just mentioned Rogue Fable 3 like that that has the option of like you know right out the gate having much much more like mix and match options of like human Cleric, Human fighter, Goblin Cleric, Goblin fighter, undead cleric, undead fighter kind of kind of things versus with this yeah like you have to go to the DLC to get it.
1:02:33
But yeah, I was kind of kind of expecting to be like, well, like maybe my problem with these melee classes is just that I need to switch to like, you know, the the undead class and then like, oh, undead melee is actually really good or something.
Maybe.
A thick dwarf.
Or.
1:02:49
Which actually, pardon me, one one correction.
The the vampires.
The vampire's blood spell attack is very that's very opiate.
That is a ton of damage, and basically insta gives anything, at least initially.
1:03:05
And when you're playing as a succubus or an incubus, you're of course allied to the to the succubi, which is great, You just get an army of succubus monsters who will then charm more monsters, and then you get a nice like kind of swarm.
1:03:21
And that, I could think, taps into the topic of like when the zaniness level is high and like the different zaniness sort of wild things are interacting.
That's when the game is kind of at its best.
I feel like, yeah, Barony, good old Ye Olde Barony.
1:03:39
I feel like earlier calling you're like I'd be willing to play more multiplayer of this game.
I think I'm probably I I definitely would take you up on that but I also think I'm I will play more single player of this game.
My biggest problem is what we've already discussed where it's like initially the first Biome and the first few character level are pretty boring and you get in this vicious cycle of like oh I want to get to the fun part of the game.
1:04:05
So you start going fast and then you start rushing and then you start making mistakes and then you start dying.
And what I ended up have been doing quite a bit is just going in to the console commands and just giving myself some levels.
So let's let's speed it up, let's get to the let's get to it.
1:04:22
And the fact that I'm willing to put in the work to have more fun with the game, I think shows that there's there's definitely something to barity, even for an FPS meathead such as myself all.
Right, obligatory music.
1:04:38
Andrew hated it.
I thought it was serviceable.
Yeah, I mean, like, I was kind of surprised when Andrew was saying like you, you were so turned off by the music, 'cause I thought like, I don't know, I didn't think it was like bad.
I just thought it was kind of innocuous.
Well, I I will say like we had to turn the music off when playing when, when playing Co-op because there was just like you have to listen for the audio cues of the sound or the the rats and the skeletons of the gnomes, particularly the gnomes.
1:05:06
Oh yeah.
And I feel like you know the music well, fine in my opinion like you, you have to like listen for so much other stuff.
It just kind of gets in the way in that.
I was perhaps a little harsh on the music.
I I don't think it's especially good.
1:05:25
And at times I find it to be grading.
Yeah, it's, you know, it's not it's.
Not the worst.
And it is interesting that like in order to like play like Peak Barony, to be like on your toes, you have to like switch the music off.
Is is kind of admittedly kind of funny.
1:05:43
I think maybe Here's the problem.
I think I might be a bit jaded.
Like indie game soundtracks have gotten so good, like over the years, like really great stuff.
And if if it's not an original soundtrack, there's a lot, you know, a lot of indie devs go out and source music from like artists, full time artists who aren't even necessarily making, you know, music that's for a game.
1:06:08
They're just trying to make the best music they can make.
And I think that's probably part of it.
And this game like, came out in 2015.
So I mean, I think perhaps the indie game production value and the the scape was was different.
I muted it right away, so I have nothing to contribute to that.
1:06:24
I don't know how you guys.
Deal with it as a tradition.
It's just.
Annoying.
If it's not some bebop jazz.
Really it's it's not.
If it ain't got, I mean, what's the point of living?
Really, I think that's what we need to play a game that has a jazz soundtrack.
I feel like the intro to our grog pods.
Indeed, it's got string broke together.
1:06:41
I mean, I don't.
I don't know why you you've made that recurring thing, but I mean.
And I originally.
But I appreciate it regardless.
I mean there was there was no way I could like figure out a way to get a an intro theme to this podcast that really matches the breadth and depth of such a genre as and and and as something as like as more people will find the like.
1:07:10
You you can't get agreement on as jazz where like something something so big and so deep and so complicated.
And divisive.
And it's.
I mean, jazz is the rogue lack of music. 100%.
Procedurally generated by your brain, it's all about playing the wrong notes.
1:07:29
Yeah.
Do we want to jump into rankings?
Yeah, do it.
Yeah.
Let's let's have Andrew kick us off this time. 5.75.
OK.
No, no, hold on.
I got a little bit more, a little part of this.
I think it's definitely an above average game.
1:07:45
I think I'll probably pay play more of it.
I say that a lot with games on this podcast.
Like yeah, well I think it's probably play more and it's not.
It's not super that that doesn't always end up being the case.
But with this I I'm fairly confident I will play more of it.
Right before we recorded, a friend of mine messaged me and said, hey, I saw you playing Barony.
1:08:07
And specifically, let's see here, the comment was that game is fucking fun.
And I was like, whoa, all right, well, I need to ask.
I need to get more more specific information.
And I said, all right, look, you know about to record this podcast.
Could you tell me in a sentence, you know what makes Bernie good?
1:08:25
So I'm going to, I'm going to paraphrase that quote here.
Bernie's cute retro presentation hides an intriguing complexity that keeps you coming back in search of that perfect run, while the procedurally generated maps keep the experience fresh and the goal elusive.
1:08:43
It gets even better with a game night with friends, cutie face emoji and I think I, you know, basically agree with with with all of that.
The cutie presentation I think works very well.
1:09:00
The complexity again, I I wish there was just a little more complex and I wish those tutorials were better presented.
And the procedural generation again speaks to what I look for.
The the, the, the core thing that I look for is meaningful randomization.
1:09:16
And I think the procedural generation in this game is overall a pretty impressive last point.
Yeah, the game night with friends it is.
It was really a blast plan.
We only played for like an hour and we only did one run.
Like that one run was incredibly fulfilling despite it ending so tragically.
1:09:34
So it's definitely above average game.
I think if I was ranking this just purely based on like how Roguy the game is, it would get a super high like rating.
Like I think I think this is a pretty Dang good rogue.
Like it does fall a little bit down, just because it doesn't quite appeal to my specific like, you know, shooter sensibilities and 1000 pardons for the wordiness real quick.
1:10:00
I just wanted to mention my last run that I did before we got on the on on to record was fired up the Doom 2 soundtrack and I went to the console and I gave myself all the best ranged weapons.
I'm talking about talking about the magical.
1:10:18
There's like a specific named artifact bow that I can't remember the name of there.
I'm talking about.
I'm talking about silver shurikens.
I'm talking about a crossbow with a quiver of of improved quick shot ammo, spring shot ammo, and fired up that Doom soundtrack.
1:10:36
And I was just running around just blasting goblins, and it was a heck of a.
Then a boulder landed on unit and all your weapons did nothing to save you.
Actually, wouldn't you believe it?
Wouldn't you believe it, That I got, I got got by a scorpion.
I got paralyzed by the scorpion and it stunlocked me and I wasn't even that mad about it.
1:10:54
So there you go.
There's fun to be had it sometimes if you're like me, you got to work for it.
And that is the end of it.
I nominate Colin to talk next.
I'm going to give it a 6.5.
I had it.
I I almost gave it A7.
But then I looked at the other games they had given it aside and I was like, I can't.
1:11:13
I didn't.
I don't.
I don't think that the single player is particularly enjoyable, but I did enjoy playing it with friends.
I think it was a fun party game, but if you are looking for a single player adventure, you could probably find something better.
1:11:28
That's it 6.5.
Well, I think we, we're going pretty close then.
I think we're all pretty tightly grouped there because I'm I'm coming in at a what did I put down 6.0 as a 5.56 point 0?
Something in that range right there.
Yeah.
If it wasn't for like playing with you all this would have been a Yep, I'm over it right away sort of thing.
1:11:47
But there was something somewhat magical about 3 of you being dead or excuse me, the I think it was two.
I think we were in person.
Two of you were dead, and there was like a, you know, the the, the gnomes, the chit.
Chats were all in the middle.
And like this this.
1:12:03
And I'm sitting in a corner charging up my mana gnome turns I I unleash the rest of my my ammo and then I'm running out to the exit.
All these things are chasing me.
No chance.
And yeah, that we got out and then that there's that was a really nice little epic moment.
1:12:18
But for all the reasons we've chatted about, yeah, just just play Minecraft.
I mean, really, it's a look it up, much more fulfilling experience.
It's the same sort of combat if you go down into a mine or something.
So yeah, it's a it's it's a mess.
1:12:34
Fundamentally different.
Game.
Yeah, for me, I guess I'll round this out.
I gave this game the highest ranking.
I gave it a seven.
I think I wound up, yeah, pushing my Shattered Pixel dungeon rating up higher the more that I played this game.
So I was like, you know, no, there's stuff about shatter.
1:12:51
How ratings work.
No, Yeah, I have to stop this is.
This is a terrible way.
As the as the dictator in chief of the podcast, I'm decreeing that we can change our ratings at any time.
Your, your, your.
Your average score is higher than everyone else.
1:13:06
I feel like you're just playing real.
You're so soft.
I guess I have to I'm, I'm the I have to be the nice guy of the podcast.
But yeah, I think like Baronie was going to be ranked way worse than than A7 up until we had those those co-ops.
1:13:22
And I think that's what really brought it together was like you know the the barely controlled chaos of like the Minotaur's hunting you down.
We you gotta Sprint to the exit.
You have three Pac-Man ghosts like leading the way and like pushing the enemies out of the way so you can you can survive another floor like there was.
1:13:41
There was a lot of fun and charm in that.
I think the the game has like a really well done interface for controller input.
I don't think it's the best way to play this game particularly, but I do appreciate that there's a lot of effort for like hot bar selection stuff on a controller, which I don't see very often.
1:14:01
Yeah, I think there's there's some bad stuff about like, yeah, melee I think is objectively bad in this game.
The first level's like way too hard.
Like I my note here is what is this return level variety.
You know all all this stuff like I was hoping mods could fix or add to but didn't really seem like it was there.
1:14:23
But the the stuff that's good about this game I like.
I like the tutorial zones in theory.
I just wish they weren't so brutal for whatever reason.
There's a lot of interesting mechanics like alchemy and and like spell casting and stuff and and NPC management which I never thought I would see in a game like this.
1:14:40
But yeah, Co-op 100% the way to go. 7 out of 10 for me.
And yeah, that's gonna that's gonna land Barony right next to Shattered Pixel Dungeon in our overall rankings, which I feel is apropos.
Yeah, Barony in a nutshell.
1:14:57
If you want some similar games to Barony, this is my best guess 'cause there's really not a whole lot of first person dungeon crawling rogue like games out there.
But my best guess is scrounging this list.
I mentioned a lot about Shattered Pixel Dungeon, I think that has a lot of similar themes Eldritch we talked about previous episode Andrew, your VR headset I imagine would get an interesting workout with the game Ancient Dungeon which very much has that kind of Barony vibe to it.
1:15:27
But I wonder if that is more if that has more of like the environmental like set dressing that we're looking for.
I'm probably one of like only 10 people on earth who's who's played Rogue Dash FP which is the first person shooter version version of the OG 1980 Rogue.
1:15:45
A lot of interesting similarities between Barony and Rogue.
FPI think Mortal Sin I think is like what if Barony was only like melee stuff but done better and then some other ones that are more kind of like, yeah, this is more like in the Barony vibe I think are Delver slashers keep unexplored and I think I'm pronouncing this right Vagante.
1:16:12
I think those are more along the lines of like your brutal traditional ish rogue like experience with dungeon crawling out.
Give those a look.
And while we still got time here before we fully wind down, we're we have a listener letter written in from, not.
1:16:32
Just any listener.
And not just any listener from a previous episode.
On our coverage of our Wilder Myth episode, one of the developers, Trico Trico Pep, has written in and says lovely review.
1:16:48
Thank thoroughly enjoyed listening, even if it pains me when players end up skipping the story.
There's a lot of hero aspects that get referenced in dialogue and have specific events associated with them that try to tie the individual story beats into a cohesive whole, often with transformations.
1:17:06
NPC mentioning a hero's wolf head and passing firearmed here, getting an extra choice when encountering an ICNPC, etcetera.
But they're all handwritten, so it can be hard to make enough to have a consistently strong impact, and many of them are subtle enough that they can be easy to miss.
1:17:24
The they go on to say, probably worth noting, our upcoming DLC, The Omen Rd. which releases May 16th, leans even heavier into the Rogue like label, removing the story and overland aspects entirely for a purely combat focused experience.
1:17:42
Thanks again for playing and for the review.
Well thank you Trico Trico Pep for writing in to the podcast.
Hopefully we weren't too brutal in our coverage of Wildermuth.
And yeah, I think like all the stuff that we were kind of lamenting about the the overworld from Wildermuth at the time like the the DLC stuff for this Omen Rd. expansion looks super cool.
1:18:04
I'm very interested in in checking it out.
So thank you for.
What a lovely letter, what a deal.
And and I can imagine that, yeah, it is extremely painful to have put in handcrafted, bespoke details that are completely best.
1:18:20
Details that specific typically are based on like you know player, the specific character you know choices and and design and everything.
Well, I feel and I and I feel.
Like, well, you know, Hey, yeah, we we fair enough.
For Wildermuth, more than most, the all devs go to heaven.
Like I truly respect the effort that's been put in into Wildermuth.
1:18:38
Like I I picked it.
It was my choice and I 'cause I want it to be good.
I want them or or someone like them to succeed because it's the game that I want to play.
And for how much complaining we did, it's almost like they developed a DLC specifically for our pain points of like, oh, you guys won an FTL style branching mode.
1:18:55
Well, here you go, quick complaining, so we got well.
The Omen Rd. was the name of the DLC.
For the road May 16th.
OK, coming down the Pike.
To check it out if yeah, if you want to write into the show for whatever reason, maybe we've bashed your game too hard.
1:19:12
Grog PUD, zone@gmail.com, send us, send us your emails in through there.
We are on the Fettiverse Grogpod at game dev dot place and grogpod dot zone is our website with all of our rankings and other nonsense and data and and stuff.
1:19:29
But nobody cares about that.
Everyone.
What everyone really cares about is the game that Will is going to pick.
I've got a winner.
Game to review, and Will's Will sat through a lot of very, very patiently sat through some games since our heroic Bellatro episode, and so he's had plenty of time to think about what he wants to pick next.
1:19:51
That's right.
I mean, I spent probably 3 hours a day trying to figure out which game I went through and I played a whole bunch of games.
I want to make sure that I, you know, something fresh that I haven't played too much of, but like.
You know as much as I want to say let's play say Aspire or Downfall, you know we, you know it's that's kind of saved that for like the our 100th episode or something.
1:20:10
But I ended up going with a game I'd never played before but the Bellatro creator mentioned in in some I don't remember exactly where like a bunch of games that he had played.
One was SNKRXI, don't know how to pronounce that.
That was I played that today one game and definitely Rogue White but Lone Star was another one mentioned and I gotta say Lone Star it's got all the ingredients of a great game And so I went through and I played the.
1:20:37
I played a game today and well my challenge to everyone else here unless you've already played it is I went ahead and beat it on the first try.
I'm throwing the gauntlet down you know all of my slate Aspire turn based strategy came to came to to help me out a lot here and I'm curious to see how you all do.
1:21:03
But I think it's it was really fun and I'm excited to see if there's more depth and if not that's fine too.
I think Hades 2 was my my second choice but I just feel like I'm going to need more than two weeks to really dig into Hades 2.
And so I'm going to try and line it up for a week where I know I won't be here and we just talked about a game before this where I know I won't be here for that one.
1:21:23
So hopefully well, you can see what that is in the future.
But yeah, Lone Star, that's that's the pick.
Exciting, exciting times.
Well play us out from this episode.
Some background music as you are haggling with a merchant for a better price on a Spriggan hat while zombies and scorpions and minotaurs are beating down the door trying trying to get at.
1:21:56
The.
1:22:24
The.
