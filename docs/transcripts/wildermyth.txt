Hello listeners.
Once Upon a time there was a podcast, and in that podcast there were games of all shapes and sizes being reviewed by podcasters of all shapes and sizes.
They were then forced to battle in a playoff bracket at the end of the season where all the games live happily ever after.
0:46
Well, and then what happened?
Well, to explain, I'm your story.
Time narrator of the podcast Scott Berger and my podcast Co host gathered around, eagerly waiting for me to turn the page.
This is this is this is your skip button.
1:01
The savior of the day, Will Wright Craft to be here.
And I'm a man who read all the dialogue, Colin, whose arms are made out of flames.
And lastly, it's me, Bandrew Kind, man, Gorgon Fighter and.
1:18
I already stole the man.
Body modification enthusiast.
Today we're talking our wholesome Paper Mario XCOM game Wildermuth released in Early Access in November 2019 and one point O in June 2021.
1:34
I was kind of shocked to see that this game was APC exclusive on Steam and ITCH IA 100% for sure.
Would have bet money that you could find this on a Nintendo console somewhere, but no.
Apparently that's coming on their dev road map.
Pretty far down the list but possibly this year 2024 maybe question mark so keep your eyes peeled for for console release coming soon.
1:57
This was developed and published by Austin TX based World Walker Games, which is This is their debut game that they've put out and this rolls in on our data set at the 65th most popular Rogue like game with 15,899 total reviews.
2:15
Will, how many comic book pages is it going to take for you to describe Wilder Myth in one sentence?
Oh my.
Well, that's that's something that's going to span many campaigns, I think.
I I'm not sure.
I could really put it into words in one sentence, but I can't.
Like just like this.
It's a XCOM that has a ton of narrative between things that are interesting.
2:38
It's not XCOM.
It's's COM, which stands for Story COM.
That's Okay.
That's another way of putting it, yeah.
But definitely, it definitely steals a lot from from what or I should say borrows the same mechanics as a lot of what X COM does.
But all the things where you're on the in between your missions you're you're basically spending your time clicking next, next, next, next and so on and so forth.
3:02
Because it's just dialogue and dialogue and they do have like little pictures for the dialogue, but it's just a lot of it.
That's my in the nutshell, I guess fantasy, I don't know what else is there to say.
It's a fantasy theme.
Classical archetypes.
Good versus evil, that whole nonsense.
I was kind of surprised to see, well, I think like we knew going into this this game that was something like X Con.
3:25
But I was kind of shocked at like the overworld, like I guess overworld management aspects of it.
And I guess in in the new quote, UN quote, new X Con, you know you have a little bit of like base building management type stuff but in this you have much more of like you're going out into the world and like clearing monsters off the map and stuff like that, which I thought was a neat surprise.
3:49
I guess I didn't really know much about this game going into it other than like grid based tactical combat and it won the coin flip from last episode.
But that and I guess like the the paper, the paper standee art really stands out to me from from like a first impression perspective of like this is.
4:11
It's not my favorite art style, but it is very distinctive, so I.
Think I kind of like the art style a lot in this game.
It It grew on me.
It grew on me as I played it.
I like the art style in stills, but in motion.
It's not my favorite.
But I I think the art, the art style that they settled on is pretty nice and thematically appropriate.
4:33
And it's also like very the the way that everything's so modular and that you can get all these different scenes is pretty clever.
I would say pretty groovy.
I like the art style for the monsters more than I do for the people.
I think, like the people are kind of cartoonish because they're cartoons and the monsters are kind of cartoonish, but they're like weird monsters.
4:51
They're they're, I mean, I'm going to say right off the bat that I appreciated that you like, well, you're saying it's like you got your fantasy stuff, but the it's not really that.
The monsters are pretty different from like there's no orcs, there's no goblins, you like your your base level bad guy is is gorgons and they're like pretty strange kind of creatures.
5:14
I mean, and then you're fighting, I guess there's like the cultists and stuff, but then the thricks or whatever they are, is like weird magic alien things, so.
I really meant about your crew.
Your crew is a warrior, Archer and sort of a mage, and so that's kind of like a traditional.
5:30
Yeah, I guess that's right there.
Or at least that's personally starts off at least oh.
Cool.
Maybe you have significantly more hours.
What what fancy new like you know 3.5 third party supplement like classes are we talking about did you encounter well the the the glass finisher and the the bolt loader Oh that's that's, you know just a reskin of a of a gunslinger.
5:56
What?
What else is there aside from the the standard fantasy classes?
Well, I think that's it in terms of classes, but like it what I mean in terms of like they the people start out pretty aggressively generic.
But by the end of the tutorial campaign thing that I was doing.
6:13
And I think that I think we all did the same campaign to start.
But at the end of it, people were looking pretty pretty like jacked up on like super items and like weird biological, like infestations or like magical infestations in their body and like wolf augmentations and things like like that.
6:33
So I think the game definitely grew into being a unique kind of experience, but it definitely starts off as like almost as generic of a fantasy experience as you can kind of get.
But I feel like maybe after 10 or 50 minutes you start to get the idea of like, OK, this is how things are kind of progressing in this sort of divergent takes hold.
6:57
So I I think like to start off with, we all did the same.
God, how do you pronounce this?
I got to mispronounce something here on on the podcast Age of Olstrix.
We all did the Age of Olstrix campaign, Is that right?
Yeah, the The Gorgon who's.
Olstrik.
He's the he's the the blue guy with this, the the spear.
7:16
Oh, the blue guy.
Right, Right.
The spear that I gave to Colin.
And then he promptly retired and took the spear with him.
Yeah, it didn't occur to me that that would.
What happened?
I mean, the game gave me a warning.
So, you know, it's my fault.
I was just like, no, the spear I needed to defeat the the mega Gordon.
7:36
I've obviously given.
I've given away the fact that I too gave up on the narrative pretty quickly.
Yo look, just for my money.
I think it's.
I think it's a pretty cool and admirable thing to have all this like sort of like randomly generated and like shuffled stuff.
And I and the writing that I did slow down to actually read, I thought was like pretty good and pretty clever and pretty interesting.
7:56
But there's just too much of it.
Like I I I want to after I finish a run of a a rogue, like be like I want a quirky story to tell.
Yeah.
But they met at this village that got attacked and then they, you know, on their way to go investigate the magic cave, they found a cat that had been abandoned by a witch.
8:15
It was a witch's familiar and it's like and that's it.
I want like one sentence.
Colin found a cat and he walked around with a cool spear, which real quick should be mentioned that of course in our first run we all just, you know made our party the, the, the members of the podcast.
So, you know, but I want to be able to say, yeah, and then he found this cool cat and it was a fun time.
8:35
But instead I was treated to like 40 panels of story about the back story of the cat.
And it's like, yeah, we got AI.
Remember when Mass Effect Three came out?
I scoffed at the idea that there was a, there was like a setting, a storyline setting.
It's like how much story do you want in your Mass Effect 3 experience?
8:52
And there was an option to be like, Nah, you know, not very much.
I want the action.
And I scoffed at that initially, but I wish so much.
There had been a setting like that where it just like gave me 1/4 of the of the stuff to read.
Yeah, give me the summary version.
Indeed, it just felt very long winded and I feel like as a result they skipped a lot of it.
9:10
You missed out.
As a result, the the problem with it was it doesn't even necessarily that it was long.
It was that it was long.
And you got like one choice inside of it.
Like if it was like a couple panels.
And then you make a choice, a couple panels, and then you make another choice, a couple panels, and you make a third choice.
9:25
And then you get something based off those choices and your characters change somewhat or whatever, and then you're on to the next battle.
It'd be different, but it was like, yeah, 40 panels, like a real story and you make one choice at the end of like take the cat or don't take the cat, which is.
9:41
So sorry, how many of us got the cat?
Scott got the cat.
I think yeah, I think I I got the cat.
I also took the the spear and spoiler alert I I wound up having Robert use the spear of the main boss to kill the main boss at the end of the campaign thinking aha, this is going to be like some kind of super cool Easter egg or something.
10:08
But no, it was just like, Yep, he's dead.
God darn.
Wow.
I I kind of expected it to be like, well, it's the campaign writing is probably too bespoke for for this to be like, oh, you killed him with his own weapon sort of thing.
I guess that's its own sort of emergent story is like me thinking like, oh, I should I should use this because like it might unlock a thing in the story, but that itself, like, is the story that emerges out of it.
10:35
I do have a bullet point in my Google doc of like like these kinds of stories that we get out of these very procedural games versus things that are written and tell you the story.
It's I guess kind of like a a show versus tell element to it.
10:52
And when, Colin, you were talking about just like so many panels to go through, I was wondering like how much better would this game be if there was almost no text in it?
And it was very much just like the cool, the cool art and just like panel, panel.
And then like your party's coming up and they see a thing and you see like their reactions to it.
11:10
Would that have been, would that have been more streamlined or better?
I think, I mean, I know that Will's answer is yes, absolutely.
I think that you need to go either One Direction or the other.
You need either more involvement in the choices or the stories need to be shorter because they're not.
11:32
They're like each little story is like fine enough in its own right, but it's not deep enough that I want to like.
I wouldn't read it if it were just a book.
And I can go read a book That's good.
There are many, many books out there.
There are many podcasts.
11:48
I can listen to AD and D podcast and basically just have someone act out these stories to me like very well.
So like, I guess it's fun that your character is in it, but they're not.
You're not playing as them in these little stories.
12:03
You get basically one little choice and like every once in a little be like, ha ha Andrew and wait, was it Andrew?
And Robert are now.
Rivals.
Yeah.
We're like, they were like I was one of Scott and Andrew were like, well, it's too bad you're not a girl.
We get along so great.
12:19
It's like, OK that's, I mean that's funny.
Like that's a funny I.
Lament that.
Every morning it's because it was between two people that I know, and I named all the people after people I know.
But like, I didn't get to direct that and I didn't get to shape.
I I wanted to actually shape the people more than I was.
12:36
Like I wanted every choice.
I wanted them to be able to make more choices and have those choices affect their like personality characteristics on the back end.
You basically make those choices when you make the character and you never interact with them again.
It kind of affects the the story options when you get the single story choice, not that much.
12:58
Well, there were two modifiers for every person.
I'm not sure if you you looked at like you could randomize.
You can actually select this property for whatever reason, but it was like snarky and like the snarky, like romantic.
You can change those.
Oh, there was an option to do that.
I'm.
Going to say if you go into the character and you click personality at the bottom you can.
13:14
Oh, so it wasn't under the the main menu with?
Everything you can, you can 100% do you.
I'm not sure if you can do there's like the brave, like the the hooks or something.
You can change them but I I'm not sure if there was something in there that I couldn't figure out how to change.
But I didn't try that hard.
13:30
Yeah, what I wouldn't what we deduced or what I deduced though is that like those two like those two words basically determine how your character works in every story.
And so they always and every like sort of like story that they tell.
And it looks like they have a whole bunch of authors because they always put the author like in the top and they're just neat.
Yeah, it's just like, Oh yeah, well, in this story, they, whoever is going to be snarky, like takes this role.
13:50
And they just kind of like just push the characters into position to play out this kind of preset thing.
And I think you're right, Colin, like the the, the customization, like really did a lot for me in the beginning because if there wasn't like the ability to make all of you and to have the story that it's like it's saying, you know, Scott's saying this and I'm saying that like, if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have paid attention at all.
14:11
And I'm so glad that in almost all games there's always a Mohawk available for me to like style my dudes.
And I'll tell you what.
Like yeah, this this is a look.
It defines me and so.
They also always have bald man with beard you.
Know and yeah, let's.
And actually, yeah, we should mention that like the, yeah, the level of options for character customization is is really good.
14:34
And I feel like just about, you know, anybody can sit down and like make their circle of friends.
So it's good that there's inclusive character customization options, but there are no horns, which is an issue if you're trying to remake D&D Party like Colin was doing at one point.
14:51
It's almost like Andrew, you missed out sorely on our very lowly rated episode of the game Low Magic Age.
But there's like, there's an idea out there of an intersection between like customization and aspects from that game, and customization aspects from this game that will make some kind of like unholy super beast of like D&D plus like procedural narrative generation that doesn't doesn't quite exist in either game.
15:21
I think this game obviously does it better, but but yeah, you would be able to get your devil horns there.
I'm pretty sure I was.
I was glad that I could make a make a person with bright red skin and as the the Caval Kincaid surrogate, but thank goodness.
15:38
And also the, Yeah, teeth kneeling Cowboys, right?
Exactly.
So for for the three of us who are in the same D&D group, our next set of adventure we make was all of our D&D characters, which is slightly more difficult.
Like you can't actually make a dwarf even though it has like the you know like human stat gets these things.
15:57
I'm like there could have been a dwarf stat maybe in the DLC eventually, but it is hard to make a a Yeah, you.
Feel like this game would be a good like pseudo intro into like DND style stuff.
Like if someone has like never experienced DND things before and like you could kind of guess that they would like this sort of game.
16:18
I could see this being like a gateway drug into that for sure.
Yeah.
But yeah, so I guess we kind of talked about the the Warrior, Hunter, Mystic classes that you have in this game.
One thing that this game kind of does differently than other games, your warrior, your hack and slash melee guy, your hunter, your bow from a distance guy.
16:38
Kind of what you would expect.
Your Mystic though very different I think where instead of using magic or scrolls that you have on your person to launch things that people you infuse with objects on the map.
So in a in a combat encounter, you know you have your X com grid in this kind of small space of like a farming village or you're battling through caves and whatnot and there's very much like pop up book scenery around of like this is a a rock and over here is a tree and over here is a wooden gate.
17:12
And I thought this was very interesting about this game where you you, you cast a thing to interact with that object from a distance and you are now like tethered to it and now you can say, aha, now I can launch rocks out of that pile of rocks at Monster.
Yeah, I just thought that was like a very interesting and different aspect.
17:30
And Will's son in the game who succeeded his Wolfman.
Being that retired, I wound up turning him into like a mage tank.
And like his idea was like he would infuse with like a whole bunch of objects like walking around the map and become like this unstoppable like melee mage.
17:49
And that looked like worked pretty well And I'm like OK, this is this is an interesting take on the magic formula.
Oh.
Yeah, and there's all sorts of like cool interactions.
So I imagine you took the ability where it's like, oh, the damage taken by the mage actually gets routed to the objects instead.
And like, there's a bunch of different modifications you can unlock like more infusion things.
18:09
And yeah, I I agree.
And it's only striking me just now how kind of fresh that spell casting take is and how often times when I hear about like, oh, you know, they're coming out with a new D&D spellcaster or they're coming out with a new Pathfinder subclass, a lot of the time it feels like they're kind of grasping at straws.
18:27
And it's like, all right, do we really need the, the crystal ball reading juggler like speciality?
Like it always kind of feels like I don't know if that's like a standard fantasy archetype but this felt like yeah interacting like using magic to interact with one's surroundings felt like a a kind of cool and natural sorcery new magical thing.
18:52
And of course all the different objects have different ability like yeah you can explode wooden objects so you can like grapple yeah grapple stuff I forgot entangle what have you and or throw boulders as you said that got a lot of use out of the throwing boulders.
In a discus approach that was really nice.
19:08
And I I have to agree like I think that the the magic system of infusing all that stuff like unique, creative and cool.
What it does though however is you have like up to five person squad and you can separate your, you know eventually you have more players and send them out and doing different things.
19:23
We can talk about the overworld in a second but like in your five person squad you basically don't want to have two pages.
Like that was my conclusion because there are often times not enough objects and to interfuse with and so like I mean that's your limiting factor.
And often like I think the splinter salvo was one of the moves where you have to be infused with two different wood objects and then you would basically blast them in towards the middle.
19:44
And that was like the biggest AOE in the in the entire game.
And you could just wipe an entire map in one move with your with your if you had your infuses done right but like but then you have like essentially nothing left.
Then you have like little pieces of crap that you can like, you know, pin them to the ground or whatever, But like, they do very little damage after that, so.
20:00
Because it's important to know after you use those like that uses up the scenery on the map and like it makes the map like bigger as a result, but you also it's like your ammo for your major.
Yeah, I mean but I'm not sure if that is a like a huge downside.
It's definitely a thing to consider if you're like trying to build a party over time you that maybe you want to have like a 2 to one ratio of the other two classes to the the Mystics like that you don't want to over index on them.
20:29
But I I really liked how it it.
It forced you to interact with the scenery of the the map a lot more and they did a very good job of the maps in including the scenery, including like stuff around there that you know you actually are interacting with it rather than just being like.
20:51
OK, I could replace this with a cube that is of full height or a cube that is of half height, because the only thing I care about this is whether or not it's giving me full cover or half cover, which is a lot of the tactics kind of games.
Like, I don't care that this is an ice cream truck.
I care that gives me full cover.
21:07
There's this, like, well, you know, it's it's a full height stack of stone.
But I'm probably going to blow this stone up immediately.
So I shouldn't use it for cover because he's not going to be covered by it the next time because I need it for the mage.
It's like, yeah, OK, I thought it.
It forced you to interact with the map in a way that I found to be like a rewarding loop.
21:25
Doubly so when the monsters invade in God, what are they called incursions.
Yes, that's it.
So on the I guess we've we've talked a lot about about the game but we've talked a lot about the story.
But our the story itself begins with monsters invading your your tiny little village that you start in.
21:44
And I guess your call to action is let's go fight the monsters, right.
It's, yeah, it's.
Pretty straightforward.
Go where needed.
I think that's the theme in the game.
Is that like what the the need and and the responsibility are.
What's important?
You fill the need and so monsters attack.
Now you have a need.
And after after said monster attack and you're successful, you come to this over world where you have a bunch of well you have like your starting little sector and you have adjacent sectors and you're like OK, I'm going to go out and explore this one and see what's around.
22:16
And when you do that, that takes time.
And in the upper right corner you have a little clock that ticks down for making the monsters more dangerous over time.
And you can kind of like spend legacy points meta currency in some regard to to dampen that down a little bit which I thought was an interesting trade off mechanism like oh do I want to use these things like craft better gear or do I want to avoid this really shitty monster that's about to come out.
22:44
I thought it was a pretty good design like brain wrinkling moment there but after I don't know I got I think it's like 300 days or so like once the in game year monsters will invade from some part of the map.
And I I don't know if like is there a loose condition like if they invade to a certain, do you have a hometown that you're trying to protect that wasn't super clear on?
23:05
That I don't, I don't really know.
I I thought the incursions were a pretty the overworld as a whole and that whole mechanic around the time passing, like all that stuff.
I thought it was kind of lame.
I didn't maybe I needed to turn the difficulty up.
But like, yeah, having done the campaign, the the tutorial, the first campaign and the second campaign which is like 5 like submissions or whatever.
23:26
Like I think I got a pretty good sense in 16 hours.
And yeah, like even with the increased difficulty, like maybe it needed maybe maybe it needed to be maximum but it felt like I never had any trouble conquering every single thing and getting all like turning after you after you beat a tile you can basically spend more time there to get items out of it or you know advance the your ability to get some currency to upgrade your your, your gear.
23:51
And I just, like, I just got everything every single time.
And like, it didn't.
I didn't feel like I was making any strategic balancing decisions around, well, if I go down there all the way to the bottom right of the map, then, then I won't have, then they'll have more upgrades and I won't be able to beat them.
It just never felt like it was a super strong pressure.
24:08
But I don't know how you guys felt about that stuff.
It did feel alarmingly easy at 1st, and I beat the whole first campaign on like the normal, the normal difficulty mode, I think, without losing anyone.
Well, I say that and then I do remember a couple times where like one of the characters was about to die.
24:24
And you have this option of like, well, you can either like have them die or you can have them retire from battle and they'll go back to a nearby town to lick their wounds and be out of combat for a little bit.
And I think I did that once or twice.
So I guess technically they died.
24:40
Which is a very cool.
System for for the record.
Yeah, I thought that was interesting.
And then like a second campaign I did, I I did only, I did three only melee guys on the next difficulty up and that that was a big mistake because they just got pummeled to death.
Oh.
Yeah, I've I've had plenty of people die like the true death because I I mean, most of the time when the character reaches zero hit points, it gives you three options.
25:03
They can either become maimed in some way and like go back to the hometown and like rest up a bit.
So it's like, oh, minus two hit points permanently out of seven.
You can with possible.
Limb modifications with limb modifications had a Captain Hook type situation happen.
25:21
Scott Burgers has an eye patch.
You can have them actually die for real and they give plus three armor to everyone.
Or the option that I used two or three times, which is deal like three times what they normally could do in damage.
25:38
Which is often like the difference between if you're on that razor's edge and you're like, this person is going to die and then I'm going to be down a person and then I'm going to be in a bad spot.
Or I could have them do 19 damage and kill the hardest monster on the map.
It's like, well, Robert the Usurper, you got to die now because I need you.
25:58
I really need you to kill this like, giant worm creature thing that's got 14 hit points and it's going to take like four turns of people to kill.
I thought the difficulty, once I got the hang of it, it was much easier.
But I got behind the difficulty curve a little early on that first intro map and it was hard like if you I lost.
26:21
I lost the the prologue campaign and I had to re I had to go back and like start from a save.
And then I figured out that oh, you just have to beat the Gorgon and not actually kill all the monsters as the victory condition.
And if you just target it all on that?
26:37
That's the way you.
Can win.
But like because I had someone die early and then have to go back and then I had two characters out there and then they've tried to fight some monsters and it's like, well, two.
Isn't it not enough?
And then they both died.
And then I had all three of my main characters maimed.
26:55
And then if you die a second time, you actually do die.
They don't give you that option.
They're just like do one measly hit point.
You get just keep doing 19 damage to every boss.
Yeah, darn.
But yeah, I I mean, I kind of agree with Will's point of there was nothing to really keep you.
27:13
Like once you got ahead of the difficulty difficulty curve, there was nothing to keep you from without pacing.
Like it didn't feel like it was responding at all to your skill or party level, and there was no other things that you could do.
Like there's no leader board that I could be like, well, I'm going to push my luck so I can get extra points on the leader board.
27:35
I just had an idea that would theme really well here.
If like you're doing like way too good after the first or second missions of like your three thing campaign, it could have like a little story beat that pops up of like ho ho ho.
You think you're doing pretty good, huh?
Well, why don't you challenge me super monster.
27:52
And if like if you beat that guy, it like sets the difficulty level up a little higher without telling you so.
And yeah, like I feel like for a game that's so narrative, like, so explicitly narrative driven, that they could have some kind of narrative aspect to drive that difficulty rebalancing.
28:13
But I guess like you know it's this game on its sleeve is very much like a a pop up storybook about magic for kids, I guess for for all ages.
And you know coming out of the gate with like your stupid Omega level rogue, like difficulty in bashing children over the head with two by fours is what we expect from other games.
28:35
Maybe not what this game is intending to do at the gate, but you do have that option to set it to painfully rogue like if you wish to.
Including a Iron Man mode I believe.
Yeah, keep an Iron Man.
Mode.
Is it?
Is it?
Yeah, I forgot what they call it, but it's an option and I was not brave enough to do that despite having embarked on some XCOM Iron Man modes.
28:57
Yeah, the overmap I thought was interesting and I like the idea of it.
Like especially in like in Dungeons and Dragons tabletop type settings.
I've seen a lot of attempts, including attempts done by myself to like track the the enemy's progress as the party is doing things and I've never found like a super great or seen a super great system for that and I appreciated that the this game captured that to some extent.
29:20
But it's doesn't seem to.
Yeah, it doesn't it, it holds back a little bit.
I never felt like really pressed on the Overland map to like make smart decisions.
It was always just like, I don't know, you know, I'll go towards the quest marker generally.
And yeah, there was never like go here or here.
29:37
That's an easy quest to make, like you must choose which one you will save and which which one you will die.
Spider.
Like Spiderman?
Yeah.
Do do we go with the kids?
Or I guess whatever the other option was.
I guess here's the thing like I had I had an A moment there where in the campaign there was like a moment where characters will get an opportunity.
29:59
I think it is like this character has an opportunity for like a a story thing specific to that character.
And I think I had maybe six or seven characters.
So I had like a full party of five and some two auxiliary guy and will had an opportunity to go and get another wolf limb attached to him.
30:15
But at the same time I already had my my main party that was going around and like trying to get to the main quest marker.
So I my either or option was, well, do I what characters do I send out on like the main mission to go to this tile here and clear out and fight the monsters while Will and some other, you know, support person go to another tile to advance his quest line.
30:38
I think that was like kind of the extent of that decision making.
Because yeah, otherwise it was like, all right, the monsters are going to invade and I don't know take over a town, but like it didn't feel like there was like a main keep or castle that like, oh I have to defend this.
And if that falls, the whole game is over the deal.
30:55
Yeah, there's like, you're starting town.
I'm sure everyone's been real sad.
Very sad.
And maybe this is just 'cause we played that first campaign, but but will, did you notice anything like majorly different between the 1st and 2nd campaigns that you played?
Or is it just like the difference in monsters really?
31:11
Yeah, the difference is focus.
In the of the five different varieties of monsters, it just shifted the focus.
There's still like monsters from pretty much everything, but like that changed.
It was like more kind of a mechanical monster.
That was the theme.
And Yep, the story was just all about defeating them or, like, joining them.
31:29
Like, at some point that you have some allies that could, like, turn into these, these creatures.
I think there's some.
I don't.
I don't know.
I skipped so much of the plot.
I'm just like, yeah, you are on my side now.
You're not.
OK, cool.
Do I kill you now or not?
Like, that's kind of my.
I'm just what's going on here?
I don't give a shit.
So, so well.
31:45
Perhaps the 3rd, 4th or 5th campaign demand more overland.
You know, strategy.
Well, I can tell you that the procedurally generated campaigns do not, because that's what I did as my second campaign.
Because like, well, I feel like as the Rogue like podcast, we should probably, at least one of us should try the rogue like procedurally generated thing.
32:06
And it's basically the same as the other game, but with the overarching story just not there.
It's just like.
Clear three things and then go fight the tower and.
Like there's darn.
There's like some story kind of that goes like each each little chapter has its own like internal story.
32:26
There's not really a story that through line that goes between all of them.
It's like, well, after, you know, there were 10 years of peace and then the Black Castle came and we had to go fight them in the castle like OK.
So, but what you're talking about are, are the generic campaigns option.
32:43
And so there's like the generic campaigns, which yeah, I mean obviously pretty generic.
And then you have your kind of like bespoke campaigns.
And I think you're like you're right about it being, I guess, I don't know, maybe a little less substantial.
But I think the the roguiness that comes into here is, is a little more subtle than we think.
33:03
And I think it's one of these things that's like this isn't a game that you you crack open like a Bud Light and you just like slam through in in like 5 minutes.
This is this game is a fine wine that must be enjoyed over a long evening and very slow.
33:20
And obviously I think there's some people out there that that will ring, ring with very well.
And I think that like the roguiness comes in from like character legacy.
And this is a thing that we're like, you know, as Wolfman Will is being built out through this campaign, he retires and goes into the legacy box.
33:40
And when you start up a new campaign, there's like a chance for Wolfman will to show up as an NPC or recruitable character in that campaign which like, you know if you have like a small set of stuff to play with At first seems, yeah, OK, like kind of not so many options to deal with.
33:57
But I can totally see after maybe playing like the first campaign, the second campaign, and you have this big roster of like people with histories and relationships between each other that like, oh boy by that third campaign things are really starting to get cooking.
And if, if you're well, shaking his.
34:13
Head Well, it's 'cause there is no like the once they become a legacy and they get go into your next campaign, 'cause I did absorb a former character into my my second campaign, Yeah, they're just like a they act as if they are a completely different person.
They have no relationships with anyone.
They ever talk about anything that happened in their past.
34:30
They just have an extra ability as and and some equipment.
That's basically the only thing that I bring to the table.
And they don't get all their abilities, they get one ability.
You get to choose which one you want.
Oh, so it's not like they are.
They are literally the character from before.
Just like dropped in a little version.
Yeah, interesting.
34:47
Well, I guess.
Not, not like unfortunately there weren't any references to the past campaign, but I did.
After beating like the the the campaign one, I jumped into like the fourth or fifth one.
And Will your character showed up the the the mage the mage, right?
35:04
And he was like the the the father of, like one of the new characters, like they were estranged or something.
And so that was sort of interesting.
And then there was a flashback where it's like, oh, yes, when I was young.
When I was young, Will.
And I thought, oh cool, is it maybe going to reference the first campaign?
35:22
And it didn't.
Unfortunately, it referenced some other event which maybe was in one of the campaigns I skipped.
But I don't know.
It was neat to see the old character show up, and it wasn't like, oh, their their story continues, but it sounds like maybe it's not quite as Meteor as meaty as we would hope.
35:41
Yeah, I would say that's the biggest surprise I have about this game.
Is that how much I liked the combat and was underwhelmed by the story?
Like, I was very much expecting it to be the other way around.
Like it sells itself as like the story engine, story builder, and like the story stuff is just fine.
36:00
But the combat's surprisingly good, so that's not what I was expecting out of it, and not really why I chose it as one of the games to look at.
I want there's something that I want, which is Andrew was talking about, which is like the D&D simulator as game.
36:17
But you don't need to be the DM and you don't need your friends.
You can just do it by yourself and where like your choices you procedurally generate story stuff and I I'm not sure I think maybe we just don't have the technology for it yet.
36:32
We need a couple years before AI ChatGPT gets merged into this and just builds the world's for us.
I was hoping this the was the proto version of it, but it's I don't think it is.
Maybe maybe one not challenge, but like one.
Like the first impression that I had from this game was like comparing this immediately to the digital version of Gloomhaven, 'cause it's like.
36:55
It's very bespoke though.
It is very bespoke grid based.
You're picking character classes and like I've and I guess like I haven't played enough of the Gloomhaven Digital version to really kind of grasp if like like does that does that do that kind of narrative generation?
37:14
It has.
I mean, obviously it has to be different, but does it do it in a better fashion than Wildermuth does or is it more like you're following a set campaign with you're?
Following.
A campaign like, I mean, Speaking of someone who literally knows the people who wrote some of the campaign for it.
37:32
Joe and Zach and them.
Like they wrote a lot of those scenarios and tried to make them interesting choices that have like real effects on your characters and stuff like that.
But there is, I mean there are a lot of events.
There are a lot of like little path things, but there's not nothing is procedurally generated.
37:50
It's all, I mean in the same way that kind of like Wildermuth is like someone wrote all of those stories and it's very difficult.
I mean Gloom Haven is a card game as the, you know, the paper version of it.
It's very difficult to procedurally generate from that and the digital version is just a digital version of it.
38:09
So I was kind of hoping that Wildermuth would tone back a little bit on the the bespoke writing and try and amp up more of the procedural generation bit of it.
And I think that they didn't they they did go more for the we're going to write a bunch of nice stories and then you'll read them which isn't I mean they're I'm sure that a lot of people really like that.
38:30
I know that a lot of people really like that.
It's not really what I was looking for or I'm I'm.
I know it's not what Will's looking for, and it seems like it wasn't really what you guys were trying for either.
Because in in that first campaign, like we all went through the same steps of like fighting the Gorgon in the barn.
38:48
One person gets infected with the Gorgon material.
Then you go and you find the spear and you got to decide if you want to like keep the spear or leave it.
And then you eventually fight the big Gorgon monster at the end like that was that's like the main over like those are the three major story beats of that first campaign.
39:05
But I was curious like what within that kind of set system was different about our experiences between it because like yeah I had like will turn into a wolfman calling.
You were the, you were the the mage that got infected with the the Gorgon thing and like my character got like astral arms and they're all like these little like the little story things like behind those that happened.
39:29
And throughout the way I'm like, oh, this is this is like the interesting difference within that overarching theme.
But I don't know like to what extent that's like, Oh yeah, that was the exact same experience Colin had.
That was the exact experience experience that Andrew had.
Indeed.
I don't fully understand how, Yeah, how randomized things are in this game either.
39:50
And you all got like, a jump start on this game before me.
And when I got to the point of fighting the Gorgon in the barn, I was pretty bummed out.
I was like, oh man, I thought that was just something that spontaneously happened like, oh, this is a set thing.
Shoot.
So I was kind of, I was a little bit bummed.
40:07
Sorry, We're gonna say con.
I was gonna say that, you know, I've got Elaine as a wolf woman.
I've got Andrew as a firearm man and I've got Scott's original D&D character Bert as the the beginning of the astral man.
40:24
So like you know we've we did definitely have some strong overlap in the random events that happened and perhaps.
That's because it's meant as like the beginner campaign.
Perhaps, No, I think it's just random stuff that happens.
I mean, it's I and I'm.
40:40
Sure that.
What I mean is that if we had all played the third campaign all the way through, like maybe our experiences would have varied more wildly.
Did any of you go?
So let's see here some one of you found had the cat encounter.
Did anyone have the Like Magic Library encounter?
Yeah, that's the astral.
40:56
That's the astral. 10 I made the wrong decisions.
I didn't get no astral arms.
Well, not yet.
Eventually you got, did you get the book?
Yes.
So then you wait like 10 years and then you're like during the during the downtime, they're like, yeah, get the, the proc, the quest to go like figure out what the book is about.
41:14
And then you go back to the thing and you dance with the with the spirits and then you get astral hair.
And then I'm assuming at some point you get astral arms.
Astral hair.
Interesting.
Interesting.
I guess I did not pursue that, trying to think what other random encounters I had or seemingly random events that I encountered.
41:32
What about the campsite with the wounded kobold?
No.
That.
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't know if I did or not.
I'm just.
Experienced.
As I can.
Well basically it was kind of interesting.
41:48
It was like the decision point.
It's like, oh, there's this little wounded kobold creature like, but he looks kind of pissed off like what should we do?
And will your characters like leave him to die?
No, I I forget exactly.
But somebody said, lad, leave him be here, whatever.
But the Scott was like, no, no, we gotta we gotta maybe take care of him.
42:04
And so I made the decision to, like, oh, spend the night and like, watch over the wounded Kobe.
And for your good deed, Scott, you got, like, punched in the back of the head by, like, a bigger cobalt creature.
And, I don't know, eventually the Cobalt's parents showed up and were like, hey, what do you what do you get out of here, you filthy human, and, like, beat you up?
42:23
But I thought that was interesting.
All right, So hey, I I had one random encounter that neither of us, nobody else had.
What?
So Rakanishu Andrews Hairless Cat is on screen now and Rakanishi was also one of my characters.
Oh, yes.
Excellent as like a playable character or as a pet.
42:41
No, as a person I.
Was using the character builder to.
Make I needed a cat, wrinkly.
And your character had a daughter and I was like, well, Andrew doesn't have any daughters, but he does have a hairless cat.
Nice, nice.
That is that Sandy.
Yeah, that is.
There is a a sort of a rich history I think the first I heard of it happening, I'm sure it happened well before this was with FTL rich history of people playing yoke likes and having to name party members and just picking people that they know.
43:07
It does add.
It is very novel and fun and I'm glad you can do that to such great effect in this game.
Great idea whoever came up with it here on the show originally.
I almost think with this game.
I almost think that that's a prerequisite though, because the main starting character is, I don't know, like it's it's something about just like they feel so, like replaceable.
43:29
I guess it's like X com syndrome, right?
Like you get like an X com soldier named, like Biff and you're just like, oh, Biff died and you're like, all right, great, he's replaced with buff and and you're like, Oh well, he died and he's replaced with Bill.
And like if like that character dies but it was named Will, then I feel like I would be a little bit more attached to it.
43:48
And so like the one of the first things about this game of like just changing those characters to be either your Co workers or you know people in your social circle I think goes a long way in terms of helping to keep that narrative glue sticking 'cause then it's much more about like Oh my my thoughts and interactions like with putting people in my social circle into this goofy game versus like oh like ulfricht Stormcloak who is now a a mage and he picked up the pickaxe.
44:21
Like I never really care.
But when Colin picked up the frying pan to fight that monster, oh this is much more juicy to to play with.
I did want to ask a a question to our our Rimworld experts where like you have Rimworld, which is like basically like no tech story going on whatsoever, but like there's a lot of emergent story things that happen in that game like is, is that more of what we're looking for out of Wildermuth in terms of procedural stuff?
44:50
Happening.
Yes.
But I don't know how you would get that into this style of game.
Like how do you make the, I mean like aside from like you know that the, the canvas or the, you know, the battlefield essentially like, oh you moved to this location.
Then the dialogue pops up of like, oh this happened.
45:06
And I don't know that's not exactly what what you're talking about Like with the style of like rim world, like the story is oh suddenly like 20 chickens decided to self tame.
Now the story is how the heck are you going to support these 20 chickens And you're going to are you going to like kill half of them or you And like I don't know.
45:21
It's just like strange things happening that you just kind of adapt to and like you know royalty visiting that you accidentally killed because you were shooting at this other guy.
But they got in the way.
Like this is the kind of thing that like I don't know how you make that in, like bring that sort of a a game mechanic into this format of a game, but I might not be creative enough.
45:41
I guess Rimworld, there's more room for chaos, which is versus here, which is much more on Rails, like even even FTL pretty on rails in terms of like, all right, you go here to do this objective, all right, You you have a decision of which node you want to go to next to do the next objective.
45:57
But like what happens in that like node picking and like the stories that fall out of like, oh, my ship was on fire and you know, I had to like use my rock man to stomp it out at the last possible second, venting all of the air out and all that.
Like that is that is the story.
46:12
And I feel like in Wildermuth, like the stories are like well written, but they're very much like on rails.
Like this is like, I could see this being like a good intro into the genre, but I don't know that it's like and it's obviously extremely hard to do otherwise we would see this everywhere, procedural story, content generation.
46:35
Yeah, I don't know.
Would you want a procedural story?
Like if all the text that appeared was a unique thing that only you had ever seen, would that make it better?
I feel like I want less text.
I feel like I want, like, universal regardless.
Yeah, Well, yeah, I.
Feel like the the, the, the only you have seen it is irrelevant.
46:53
It's I want to be able to make a choice and have the world react to it in a way that's like a a strong reaction.
It's like I choose, you know, you can go with the Princess to go here or you can tell her to stay here and be like, no, I killed the Princess.
47:12
It's like, well, that's not an option.
But I mean, you could do that in D&D, be like, well, this is going to go off the rails and we're going to go on a real different story now and like, now the now the story is how the world reacts to your heinous crime.
Like, I want, I want to be able to make choices and have those choices have meaningful effects.
47:31
And that's really hard to do if you're writing bespoke stories where you have to like, OK, each branch is two different options.
You like You're infinite.
You know, 64 branches down.
You have an like an infinite number of we already we.
Already know Colin though that you don't actually need to maintain 64 different like like Mass Effect I think is a really great example of this.
47:51
I think 2 Mass Effect Two comes to mind.
I don't know so much about the the other ones.
I mean, I I did play.
I think at least I played one.
But in any case like those are stories where your decision matters, but those decisions are like for the like to some degree independent of each other.
And so you can like have a different outcome over here, happen like this.
48:09
The thing you chose over here to save the AI instead of the other species like that impacts this like one like or one or two paths.
But it doesn't impact everything else along the way.
And you don't even actually get to see the impact of this until you like trigger it like by going to a certain place.
And so it it feels like you can maintain lots of important decisions that feel meaningful, that don't require you to have a story that's, you know combinatorially impossible to maintain with how many different branches you can go down.
48:37
Yeah, but Mass Effect is a giant game that was expensive to produce at.
Like the the the appeal of something that's procedurally generated is that you can make as many of those stories as you want on the fly, and obviously we can't do that.
It's what I want to be able to do.
48:54
Bespoke is still going to be better than than anything.
But how?
But you can only play Mass Effect once or twice.
That's all you need done, Mass Effect.
That's all you need.
I think I have one.
Last, but what if I want another Mass Effect that's not Mass Effect?
Colin, The Mass Effect, That's not Mass Effect that we've been kind of glossing over this whole time.
49:10
Very, very text driven, but still kind of bespoke, emergent gameplay worsen.
Yeah, Also, I have to.
Aside here, I haven't actually played Mass Effect, so I don't care about Mass Effect.
Oh my.
I also have not played Mass Effect.
What?
Do you guys call yourself gamers and you haven't played?
49:27
I don't.
I don't have no right to be on this.
Mass Effect.
Cardboard standing, Commander, Shepherd's appointed.
I've only played the third one all the way through.
It's honest, it's it's one of those series where it's like I I I admire it more than I actually like it.
49:42
If that makes sense.
I don't think.
Anyway, sorry Will.
You're the only real gamer.
Here I I yeah.
Yes.
I I felt like I thought that was a kind of a ubiquitous like oh if you want they like this is the this is the game where you get to learn like that this important decisions are like done well like they started that with Fable.
50:00
I think was within the very first games that came out with like your decisions put you on a spectrum from evil to good and like and that actually had some significant impact on like the style of game.
But this was like decisions were are they determine your your relationships they determine the fate of species they determine.
50:16
I think there's like like many different like ways the game actually ends.
But along the way like you know some people will like you and not based on what you've done and some people like will want to recruit you or not based on did you do this mission well enough.
And I don't know I thought that the and the dialogue that you're choosing.
50:31
I thought that was all beautifully done and I recommend that.
Yeah, no, totally.
And one would have hoped though that like I I would have expected Wildermuth to maybe have more opportunities to do that where it's like very clear like oh, because I made this decision the the effects you know, played out in this particular way down.
50:52
Like your wolf hands, like somehow, but like, you know, you put that into like the grooves on this, this, this wall if we just fit it for your fingers and then the door opens.
So because you got that thing you can go into the new a secret area.
I don't know.
Something, yeah.
Even even something as as simple as that for sure.
And well, you know that is.
51:10
That is a very specific example.
I didn't have the Wolf Man side quest, so I gotta go explore that after we finished recording.
It sounds very intrigued, but but yeah, also The Witcher comes to mind.
There's a lot of specific examples in the Witcher series where it's like you sided with this person, so whatever.
51:28
And in The Witcher 2, which is probably the weakest of all the games, the second act is completely different based on what you do in the first one.
So those are good examples.
And those are of course, as you said, call it big AAA games.
They're like huge, hulking, hard to maintain in some cases products.
51:46
But with Wildermuth it's got this like streamlined aesthetic and this modular aesthetic and I would hope I would have wished to have seen more of those decisions and consequences that are like meaningful.
And again, you know, just to full transparency, you know, I I only played like 4 hours of this game, so maybe it increases, but from Will's experience it sounds like not.
52:09
So it it decreases actually.
Oh no.
I did really quickly though.
Wanted to chime in on the combat.
I didn't love the combat.
No.
Specifically the camera controls, I did not enjoy at all.
Like I don't want to muck around with the controls, the camera controls that much.
52:27
It was just like you you mentioned earlier, Scott, like being surprised that it's PC exclusive based on the camera controls.
I ain't surprised them some PC exclusive as camera controls or it's like I don't need to fine tune it like you can you can handle.
It's cool to have that option, but like, I wish the automated camera system was a bit better at just displaying the map and the key information.
52:50
Yeah.
Anyway, not great, but not, I don't know, it's not the end of the world.
It's not great.
Well, the Steam deck review corner here.
I was actually pretty shocked at how how well the information was displayed on the Steam deck.
To the point where I'm like, oh, it's just using whatever console build they use for the the game GamePad mappings and stuff.
53:09
So clearly this has been ported to the Switch, right?
Right.
No, I feel like it.
When this does get released on consoles, it'll probably be a big hit because like, oh, this is like a good, a good way to get console players like into, you know, RPG light elements.
53:28
You know, it's got like a good whimsy aesthetic.
It's very all ages at A.
It's a great bus ride game.
Yeah, good for the whole family.
People aren't getting sliced in half so you can have like some little kid look over your shoulder and not be like trying to hide it from on the plane.
Do we wanna transition into our rankings?
53:47
Sure, let's go mines.
Pretty short for me, this is a 7 out of 10 game.
I didn't especially love playing it.
It was a little bit of a grind at times but from a game design perspective and the design goals and everything I admired and I think that for some people the combat is clearly in a more engaging but as we established with the last spell term based combat I need to be like fast and furious and like super engaging and so that's that's mostly a me problem but anyway yeah 7 out of 10 I think it is a cool game and it's manages to nail a few things that I have not seen nailed before.
54:35
Disable top space of like the whole tracking the enemy and as as you move the enemies are moving and like it.
Feeling kind of like a an ongoing living campaign is very cool and the and the the like legacy elements are neat as well and maybe they can be sort of filled out a bit in future additions to the game or maybe a sequel, who knows.
54:56
Well, unlike Andrew, I'm going to rate it a 7 out of 10.
No, I've I I mean I think I have.
I've rated rated it the same but for different reasons.
I wanted it to be I I was pleasantly surprised with the combat.
I enjoyed it more.
55:12
I had no problems whatsoever with the camera controls, but I use CAD all day at work so I'm just used to like weird camera controls all the time.
Like I thought that combat was pretty good, I was expecting it to be just mediocre and I thought it was well, like when the difficulty curve was at like when you were crossing.
55:33
I thought it was pretty well balanced and there was enough interesting options on how to how to lure people back or or you know interact with the enemies.
However, the reason I wanted to play this game was because I wanted it to be that story calm, and I just kind of found the stories to be that.
55:53
The stories were fine, but they were too self-contained for what I wanted them to.
I wanted them to be D and DI mean that's really what I wanted to be.
I wanted to procedurally generated and like truly interact with the things that you've done with the characters but really just would slot them into the archetype of you know, here's event this, which person gets to speak based off of like which they're the most score.
56:17
And then it plays out the scene and I wanted it to, you know, I wanted every scene to like change their alignment or make them you know, oh I hate, I hate Gorgons now because they killed my friend in this battle.
Like I wanted it to be a little bit more dynamic and it it wasn't that maybe it will be in the future maybe maybe will or miss too so.
56:37
I mean, unlike Colin and Andrew, I'm going to have to give it a seven, I think.
No, that's that's that's what I had on the list here.
Yeah.
I I I agree, Colin.
That passes your recommendation threshold.
I I I think it it does it it barely it makes it over.
56:55
I mean yeah it's and and the reason is I think very similar to Colin which is I think the combat was actually fun like that.
I I I didn't have to complete the second campaign I think to like review the game but like I wanted to like I open the game up and I'm like you know what this is this is fun.
57:13
The actual progression system of like the abilities, synergizing that with the equipment that you're getting and your play style.
It felt rewarding and I and I like XCOM style games in general.
This is sort of like a turn base puzzle is like these these beard scratchers as they're known.
57:30
I I don't need that fast based combat in order.
This is actually much more my my style and so I had fun with that.
I just really couldn't give it couldn't care less about the the narrative and that was just way too much of it.
The the narrative, the overworld really, if they would have tied it together with like, I mean if you think about XCOM, it's just like it is that fight scene like interspersed with like just something to kind of like feel like the the, you know, the town experience.
57:55
And so they just had a different town experience.
Maybe that looks more more like, what's that?
What's that game you just referenced?
The storm, the something of storm.
I forgot the name.
Against the Storm.
Against the storm, right, like we're in the town setting.
You're like buying all the things to upgrade your your your your town.
58:12
Maybe you're buying things to upgrade your city.
Maybe you're actually like creating good and like, oh, we're going to build a a windmill over there and we're going to do this and then like.
You're you're you're talking about the last spell against.
The spell you.
Wanted to play in the future.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
That's the one.
Yeah.
It's like windmill.
58:29
But anyways, I so it was fine.
Seven.
Yeah.
As good as cold.
The lamb makes sense.
Well, unlike Andrew, Colin and Will, no way I am going to rate this game a 7.83.
58:46
Oh my.
What is this?
What?
No, that's too many.
You.
Couldn't have done as the courtesy of doing 7.7 come.
On You're not that precise.
I'm just going to be real with you.
Too many?
Significant figures.
If I did a 7.7, I think like the the floor on my ratings for this game is Grifflands, and I think this game is ever so slightly better than Grifflands.
59:03
I like the aesthetic of Grifflands more, but I think Wildermuth is more.
It feels like it's more succinctly put together.
It's more streamlined for sure.
I think for what Wildermuth is trying to do, it, it succeeds at it.
59:21
And I think that that thing that it's trying to do isn't necessarily for everybody.
But I liked it.
I I liked getting into the campaign and just like like lurching into the couch and just like storybook paging next page, next page and like it.
It didn't feel.
59:37
I mean yeah there there was like a lot of next paging and there was a lot of text, but it was like a nice kind of experience just to like wind down with.
I think the music was was really good, maybe if a little bit repetitive.
They have a live performance version of the of the soundtrack coming, which I think like that that will probably help a lot with this game.
59:59
I think the like the soundtrack is is good, but you can you can kind of tell that it's sampled.
Yeah, I said the plays really well on the Steam deck.
The story beats I thought were fun and interesting.
Putting characters that you know about in there made for a fun experience.
1:00:17
I'm kind of, I'll be curious to complete maybe like one or two more campaigns to see how that legacy content rolls through and if it's just like how cookie cutter is it.
Yeah, I thought it was surprisingly fun for not really knowing much about it.
So, so yeah, I think on our aggregate rankings that's going to drop it in in our 16th out of 38 games that we've ranked just behind Risk of Rain and just ahead one slot of Griffland.
1:00:44
That seems about right.
It seems like Grifflands and this game I think are kind of like two different sides of a coin in some regard of narrative driven, roguey question mark experiences with like totally opposite aesthetics.
But some other games like Wildermuth I guess like we kind of talked about Gloomhaven, it's not really quite the same style as similar, it's definitely I guess Gloomhaven is really Roguy per SE.
1:01:10
But see previous episode Invisible Ink into the Breach is kind of similar from like grid based mechanics.
I guess it's more puzzly but like Overworld stuff to some degree.
Steamworld Heist is kind of similar from like like the 2D art perspective Inkbound with.
1:01:28
It's it's kind of grid based tactical cool stuff.
Renowned Explorers International Society looks kind of interesting in terms of like whimsy graphics and grid based combat.
Check those games out those, those seem interesting.
All stay tunes for sure.
What are?
We playing next.
Well, before that, yeah.
1:01:44
So.
So write in e-mail grogpodzone@gmail.com.
You've heard all this stuff before, but I get I'm contractually obligated to do it.
People, this is what the people want.
We have to interrupt our very important section for the preview.
Mastodon Grogpod at game dev dot place and grogpod dot zone.
1:02:00
Is the website OK?
Now as one story ends, another begins.
We turn the page on Wildermuth to come to Andrew's pick for our next episode.
All right, well, this next game, I hope y'all are ready for some first person in person on site medical treatment.
1:02:24
That's right.
We're getting committed to the FPS rogue experience known as Nightmare Reaper, to quote various other people who have reviewed this game.
It's good.
I've.
1:02:40
I've delved into it a bit, and I hope you all enjoy it as well.
I think there'll be an interesting discussion to be had about how Roguy or not is it.
But oh, you know how I love randomization?
And there's a heck of a lot of randomization in this first person shooter, so buckle up.
Just looking at the steam trailer, this one is probably less bus appropriate.
1:03:04
Colin, are you saying a grappling hook, chainsaw and pixelated blood and demons are not?
Just like I'm looking at it.
Just like the first thing is just like a woman with blood on her hands, and it's just just like blood and gore exploding as you're like chainsawing through things.
Looks fun.
1:03:20
Yeah, I'm excited.
Well playing us out from this episode will be some nice relaxing non blood infused death metal tunes.
Stay tuned for next episode for that.
But some nice relaxing deep string cello synth vibes from from Wildermuth and we'll see you next time the.
