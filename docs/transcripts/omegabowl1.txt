Hello and welcome to the grand finals of the first season of the Grog Pod Rogue Like podcast where each episode we take aim at a Rogue like game, big or small.
We try to rank them in the pantheon of roads as best we can and This is why we rank them for an end of year celebration of our favorite games and to crown a champion for the season.
0:40
For 416 days we have looked over 36 games and come to 12 finalists through six categories of 1 enigmatic genre Rd.
Light games.
More than 30 countries of listeners have tuned into our our Lowly podcast, including the USA, Canada, but also including the UK, Sweden, Brazil and Australia, helping us to cross just over 10,000 total downloads this month.
1:15
This year will Faster Than Light, FTL and Dead Cells hold off the competition from their number one and #2 positions respectively?
Or will the dice favor luck be a landlord through the tournament?
We're here to find out.
I am your play by play coverage analyst for this tournament.
1:32
Scott Berger and with me for this inaugural kickoff in the announcer booth are my Co hosts.
This is Will, otherwise known as King Solomon, the wisest of judgments to tell you how to chop these babies up.
And me, Andrew Harshman, you're ready to play in the Omega Bowl.
1:51
I'm going to do some football stuff like you ain't never seen first down in every time.
And me, Colin, using a more a better sports metaphor, I'm like Will, I am the referee who knows the objective truth about the state of the games.
Flag 10 year penalty Yes.
2:09
Welcome to something that's more than super.
It is an Omega bowl of games where we were using this as an excuse to to round up and revisit our games that we've talked about throughout the year and assess if our opinions have changed.
2:28
And give people a a good platform where if they are new to the podcast or new to the genre, I give them a place to to come and kind of get a sense of what all this madness.
And yeah, so over over the past year we've looked at a lot of different games which we've crudely tried to cram into six different categories.
2:50
I think we've kind of come to the conclusion that a lot of these games can't really fit into one bucket, but for playoff purposes we're going to force it.
So our categories this year have come down to deck builders, platformers, solo dev games, squand management games, traditional Rogue likes, and I guess in air quotes, twin stick shooters.
3:15
And it's interesting some of these divisions are are also somewhat interesting where our deck builder division started off pretty stacked a few months ago with almost all of our top games coming out of it, but over time has transitioned more to be balanced between that and whatever our squad management games are.
3:36
Our deck builder category leads with the most games that we have reviewed for the year with eight.
Our platformer category has the biggest gulf between our best and worst rankings between our number two and our #32, but it also has the fewest number of games that we've covered with only four so far.
3:55
But we'll see how that changes.
Solo Dev It was a a tight photo finish horse race between who got the The Division winner between streets of Rogue One, Way Heroics and Warsim only being separated by .03 rating points.
4:14
So it could have gone either way.
Some of these might return in the future for an All Star game.
We shall see.
And all these ratings are fluid as well, so we might even readjust these as our tournament bracket episode continues.
Our squad management category, maybe the most nebulously named, is our most representative category tonight with four playoff entries.
4:37
Our traditional rogue like category maybe unsurprising for this group of Co hosts, but our overall lowest rated category and then our twin stick shooter category exists our division winners.
4:53
So the the games that have clocked in at the highest rating for each of these buckets come out to FTL Faster Than Light, Dead Cells, Monster Train, Binding of Isaac, Cog, Mind and Streets of Rogue.
And because we wanted to maximize chaos, we decided to go with an NFL style playoff seating system.
5:14
So our wildcards rounding out the rest of the tournament bracket include Rim World, Asterisk, Asterisk, Asterisk, which we'll come to in a second.
The last spell, which was a listener, requested episode enter the Gungeon Andrews debut episode, Hand of Fate Two, Invisible Ink, and Luck Be a Landlord.
5:36
The way this will go is that we're for each round of this recap podcast, we'll dive into a a Game Match up between two Titans of the of the genre.
And then we'll we'll talk about them.
We'll talk about how how our thoughts and feelings have changed about them.
5:56
We'll do some voting about whether or not if we think it should advance, and then we'll also reveal the the listener vote.
We had a lot more people respond to the to the listener request form that I thought we would, which was great.
6:11
Thank you for doing so.
And we have some fan picks for each round which will help us to break ties should we should we need them.
And then we'll recommend the, as always, games that are similar to those as we escort them out of the venue and give them a door prize on the way out.
6:28
I'm excited.
This is the first time I think that I'll really get a sense for how demented our audience truly is.
Or hopefully you know if.
They start with me.
And so we'll find out here soon enough.
Well, let's not forget that, you know, the audience brought us the amazing the last spell, so they got to have something going on with them.
6:47
But yes, we will find out they're they're true.
We're going to test the listener's metal and their mastery of good taste.
Or they'll tell.
Test us.
Oh no.
Right, so our first round here kicking us off is a contentious one probably.
7:06
I well at first I was going to say these two games couldn't be more opposite if we tried, but it almost seems like all of these wild card matchups are like pure opposite games.
I did not intend for the rankings to shape out this way, but this is this is how Dead Cells pushed everything else down the list.
7:25
So our first round is our #9 seeded cog Mind versus our number 11 seeded Luck be a landlord.
I'm already angry.
I already know this is a tragedy.
This is a tragedy of the.
7:41
Seating tragedy?
Golly, Cogman can't have this spot, but inevitably you fools will choose to put it above the gorgeous game that is luck.
Be a landlord.
I can't believe so.
I have played both of these games extremely briefly, so you're gonna be getting from me a very sort of nubish oh.
8:01
Wait, so I can can I win you over?
Is that potentially 0?
My goodness, but I have I have a a quick question.
I was under the impression The Cog Mind was a totally like ASCII art game, but upon booting it up earlier today I found that there were some the the map had a simple sort of cutesy Sprite based system.
8:22
Is that new or old?
That is, for a long time.
That's been there forever.
There is a button that you can toggle between the two, and there's an NPC that you can talk to that briefly scrambles your vision into ASCII mode.
Oh, that's kind of fun.
That's cute.
Very cute.
8:38
Very cute.
So the the way that yeah this is going to work is we're we will be each be placing votes and then if there's a tie then then we'll you know we'll use the the listeners as as the tiebreaker.
But at at what point should we state our votes?
Well, I think we'll, we'll give it a couple minutes to just kind of simmer.
8:57
Discussion and debate right, of course.
You know, lean into the the hot tub of each one of these games and just kind of, you know, sit back and relax and really kind of rethink and reevaluate our our thoughts and feelings about each of these games.
Right on.
Well well to summarize very briefly, Cog Mind of course is a modular robot building, very old school rogue like game going around in a grid playing and turn based harsh randomly generated combat situation.
9:28
Luck being landlord is a pattern building very whimsical and really gets that serotonin flowing.
A not a gambling game per se.
I guess you're gambling with your life, but a.
A.
Yeah.
9:45
It's an anti capitalist rent simulator.
Jackpot simulator.
What?
What is it?
What are those even called?
It's a slum machine simulator.
I haven't been to Vegas in a while.
Slot machine.
Slot machine.
There we are.
Classic, the only good kind of slot machine as far as, I mean the modern games associated with opening crates and things like that.
10:02
Anyway, they're very different games and it's tough to compare them.
But here's something a question I'd like to throw to the group Luck Be a Landlord has a very clear theme in terms of the tone and the messaging, and it has to do with capitalism.
10:18
I'm curious what's what is?
What is Cog Mine's theme?
What?
What?
What is the what kind of metaphors and analogies and social commentary can be gleaned from Cog Mine?
I think Cog Mine's Cog Mine's theme is being robots and being tactically flexible in that Hogmind feels like very different compared to all the other traditional Rogue Light games that we've played, in that instead of building up an inventory of things and you get so attached to your items, Kogmind is the one where it's like, oh, I should not get attached to my items for longer than like 5 minutes, 'cause they're just gonna get blown off my body anyway.
10:57
And that's a good thing because there's so many wacky parts and things.
And that's why we also never get attached to Scott's Internet connection.
Because it seems that he is frozen up, seized up a little bit.
11:14
Maybe he's role-playing and doing this podcast on turn by turn.
Oh oh very good.
OK.
Architecture is unstable.
Excellent.
It's the Omega Bowl.
It's draining all the bandwidth.
Exactly.
I think the theme for Cog Mind is flexibility.
11:32
So being able to be build flexible, being able to be strategy flexible and and unironically has a very well written plot to it which you wouldn't expect at all from this type of game.
There is there's a story reveal about the true identity of the player character that I thought was really well done and I haven't really seen anything like it.
11:56
I think that it's it.
KOG Mind has a like a theme that is in informed by the mechanics of the game more than it is a theme imposed by the like like explicitly told to you.
Like the the flexibility theme is like you could play Kog Mind and have no story and then you kind of get that.
12:17
Like it maybe it's more of a vibe than a theme just because it's like, oh, your stuff's getting blown off and you're like ramming things back onto you.
And you're Oh no, the Death hunter bots are coming after me like, well, throw away these tracks and put on some hover boosters and fly away and then like, sneak into something and grab the things and yeah, I don't know.
12:38
Oh, Andrew, I I've got it.
I've got it.
I remember from our Cog Mind episode, I think I had to.
I think I gave some snippy comment about it.
It's theme is Mecca Gear Solid.
Wow.
OK.
There's a lot of stealth mechanics involved.
12:54
Robots.
It's it's such a a well done and accessible version of a traditional rogue leg which is like something that we don't see with some other games which are kind of proudly obtuse for that kind of specific style of rogue game.
13:14
A game that you can play entirely with your mouse.
Like we kind of take it for granted with all the other ones on this list.
But traditional rogue likes are notorious for having like vim style mania of keyboard commands and I think that like it really shows with like how much accessibility Polish has gone into it.
13:32
So I know, I know Will is kind of dreading like oh they're everyone's going to dogpile on Cog mind.
It's going to, it's going to chaos dunk on luck, be a landlord.
I will say I have been playing a lot more luck be a landlord over the past couple weeks than Cog Mind.
13:49
And I think that like, the more that I'm playing an understanding of luck, be a landlord, the more I'm appreciating like the subtlety of its game design mechanics that at first, yeah, it does look very cutesy, but there's really a lot of deep synergy deck building going on that you wouldn't expect if just, oh should you pull the slot and it makes the things go.
14:11
But there's so much happening strategy wise under the hood that it kept bringing me back, and it doesn't help.
The Cog Mind will probably never be playable on a Steam deck natively, but it did help for luck be a landlord to just be able to fire it up on the couch and play for 5 minutes at any given time.
14:28
Yeah, I mean, luck be a landlord.
It's just straight fun.
I mean, it's just you started up, you don't know what the heck you're doing.
And I'm envious of anyone out there who's never played this 'cause you get the joy of learning how everything works and like getting all those dopamine heads as you're like, Oh my goodness, if I synergize these things, ah, that changes everything.
14:46
And then you get it again in the future.
And oh, it's just such a wonderful development.
And I, I I wish I could play the game as if it was brand new again.
But unfortunately, like, I try to go back to it now and it's just like, yeah, I already, I have the perfect strategy essentially memorized.
And it's just not as fun in the way that for some reason slate, Slate Aspire still is.
15:05
For me, I have to use the term Slate Aspire at least once, apparently in every podcast.
And so there I got out of the way.
Probably even brought it up in your.
Oh, good point.
Yeah, we brought it up in your stead last episode we we're sure to mention.
It I'm I'm glad that that's at least ongoing here because obviously if the latest Spyro was in this it would win just automatically.
15:23
We wouldn't even need to have this at all.
But I I will say for Cog Mind I think it's a great idea.
They just needs the the the biggest problem is just the isometric graphics is what it need to need to have into the Breach style graphics would have made that game go from a I don't know would I give it like a A3 to an 8 immediately, an 8 or a nine like I just need like the the graphics are just so terrible.
15:46
I can't appreciate what's going on at all with with just how terrible that looks.
It's actually actively detracting from the game with how bad it is.
All right, so in the spirit of a lot of other games that we got to cover, do we have anything, any, anything else that we want to to say about our match up between Cogmind and Landlord before we head into voting here?
16:06
Well, what's the time per that we're supposed to get for each of these?
Like, I just wanna make sure we're cognizant.
I think we're gonna do at least like, yeah, 30 minutes to an hour for each one of these.
Yeah, I was gonna say we're we're not doing so well so far, OK?
So yeah, we're gonna have to be choppier about this.
Yeah, probably.
I'll one last concluding remark from me.
16:23
I feel like luckily a landlord has grown on me in into remembering.
Like I looked back at my rating and I was surprised that I had it pretty middle of the road.
I think that it has aged well in my mind.
It was a fun little game to play this.
Sounds like a eulogy but but it's nice for you to say.
16:42
Yeah, I think my my, let's see, last ratings I gave Luckby Landlord A7.
I think the last time I rated it.
I think I have to bump that up to a 7.5 at the very least, 'cause I think the more that I come back to it, the more that I'm like it's just it's just a fun palate cleanser type of game.
17:00
It's so different than like then when I would pick up cog mine to play around versus picking up a landlord to play around and but I enjoyed my time with it every just about every time except for when I have like what I thought was a good synergy going and then you know you lose your rent by 1 gold at the end of it.
17:19
But it wasn't, it wasn't meant to be if the synergy was not there.
So that's capitalism for you.
I vote cog mine.
Obviously luck be a landlord I.
Think I unsurprisingly am in the Cog Mine camp as it's my number one game on the list so far.
This puts me in a a tough spot.
17:35
Let the audience decide.
Come on.
Chaos.
Chaos.
For fun, right?
This whole thing, it's not especially objective.
We're not, you know, crowning the best game ever.
And all the other ones can go, you know, kick rocks, listen in a good way to to to venerate this wonderful genre and everything.
17:52
We got to throw it to the listeners, yeah.
OK, all right, we're gonna do it.
You're gonna you're gonna hate me for saying this, but the listeners have decided we have a we have a vote.
The vote is locked in the The smoke coming out of the listener chimney is white, which means cog mind.
18:11
Which of degenerates?
God damn it, you listeners, You piss me off.
What is wrong with you?
Oh my.
Although in the listeners defense they did, they did rate luck be a landlord pretty well, but cog mind they rated higher.
So cog mind gets the listener vote What?
Did did they actually?
18:27
Was it was it a binary decision or was it a a rating sort of thing?
The the submissions were it was again kind of like I had to force people to to put things on a one to five scale.
Not that any of these games are a one out of five but relative to the other games like ah yeah, is the what, what are your thoughts on this And some people did fives across the board.
18:48
Some people did ones across the board.
But yeah, like I computed out average ratings from those and I've just sorted them by the average rating.
All the the counts are pretty pretty close to each other so.
Give me names who who is the individual voter of.
Anything.
I don't have the time for this.
19:03
We have to keep going.
Right, let's see, maybe I can do a A listener shout out.
Wait, you're actually?
Going to give me some.
Names AN-7 UR was one of our listeners who who wrote in so they had a shout out.
They it might This is a secret ballot.
I don't know if I can give out.
19:20
I have this like I.
Feel like he has a comment.
We had a move, or he or she?
So I'm a.
I'm after you.
They did.
They did get that was like.
A rogue like, you know, World generation seed.
All right, Yeah.
What's?
This out play play luck.
Be a landlord out for Scott.
19:37
Right.
Yeah, we got to give the door prize.
Yeah, so.
So if if you are a fan of luck, be a landlord.
Some other games that you should check out that we haven't mentioned yet are God I don't know how to pronounce this one.
Fu Tang Simulator, FHTAGN Simulator.
19:54
It's supposed to be a very lucky landlord style game.
Dicey dungeons for better or worse like some like a lot of these games are so unique it's hard to recommend things that are remotely similar, especially Landlord but Fu Tang Simulator, Dicey Dungeons, Slice and Dice and Circadian Dice can help round out some of your probabilistic dice and or deck building mania.
20:18
But will as the person who who rated landlord the highest, what would be your your door prize to escort them out of the building?
Oh, I I, I I don't know.
A door prize.
I don't know what the example of this would be in the context of what we're doing here.
I think it might.
Be likely to think about like the The prize is the the thing in a high school yearbook game most likely to succeed, Game most likely to kill a billionaire growing up.
20:43
Oh most fun per developer hour developing that's looks very good.
It's.
It's a bare bones but the.
Design is brilliant.
Also it has an item called pizza the cat.
Absolutely OK, right?
Match up two streets of Rogue First Invisible Ink.
21:01
This one was tough for me to come back to because I had this idea of, like, you know, when I when we first covered invisible ink, I was kind of excited.
But it felt like it was just kind of dragging me down somehow, like it was using.
It was requiring me a lot more energy to play it than I was getting out of it for some.
21:19
Reason thinking it's hard, right?
It is spindle.
This Spindle snot machine look a pretty color, and again another kind of very, very opposite day grouping we have here.
Streets of Rogue.
We had, I think, accidentally beat the game on our first try with a party full of apes running around bashing stuff.
21:43
Yeah, that was good.
And just complete chaos the whole time.
I remember us like having to dodge missiles raining from the sky and like, I didn't have any idea what was happening.
I was just run to the exit.
We had one like hit point left and we we passed that mission, damn it.
And we elected the ape mayor at the end of the game, which was delightful.
22:03
But I don't know.
I feel like invisible ink.
I feel is is like my brain says that's the better game, but my heart says Streets of Rogue is more fun.
I don't know.
I'll have to toss it to the peanut gallery here for for their thoughts.
I'm actually having kind of a similar reaction to it.
22:20
I think that Invisible ink has been hurt by comparison to better game.
Like it's it's part of the squad management category and it is the last of the four games from that category to make it in.
And it's like, Oh yeah, Invisible Ink is a really good game.
But look at these other games that are better than it, and it's like, Oh well.
22:40
And then you look at Streets of Rogue and it's it's just a completely, there aren't other games that we've played that are really like it.
It's it's own unique thing, and it was just a wild time running around getting like hit by weird goo and turning into giants.
And just like, it was a truly weird and fun game to play.
22:58
Well, both these.
Games have pretty decent tutorials, which we talk about a lot, and they're both pretty pretty solid, pretty decent.
I gotta say.
Streets of Rogue.
I mean, Streets of Rogue is like 100% more my game.
Like I was.
23:14
I didn't even make it through the first proper mission of invisible ink like it was.
It was becoming like painful for me to continue it.
Kind of.
I realized it was just the first mission, but it felt a lot like I was playing, I don't know, some kind of weird browser based, like really janky game where it just kind of felt like I I had to click on the right buttons in the right order.
23:39
And you know what?
This is this, this examination that I'm doing is totally off the cuff and I barely got into the game, hardly know.
But Streets of Rogue is 100% more my style and it it definitely spoke to me right out of the gate.
And it has better music.
23:55
So I I think objectively we can say it has better music, therefore it's a better game.
Streets of Rogue, of course.
You've failed me for the last time.
Actually, no, you.
Actually, we succeeded the last time, so I won't hold it too much against you here.
I think these these games are a little bit closer than the last one.
Where luck be, excuse me?
Luck be a landlord is clearly much much better cog mine.
24:13
But here it's a little closer.
Invisible ink though still much a much better game overall in my opinion.
These these streets of these these chaos sort of like run around shoot things sort of.
I I don't know it's not I like I like your sit and think and your your your beard scratching games as I think you called it before.
24:30
These are my preferred style so it's got to be invisible.
It's not a great game, but it's a it's a good game.
All right.
Well, I think it seems like it's a bit of a toss up.
What we got to go?
Come back to you, Scott?
Yeah, I think maybe I'll kick off voting with I'll say this, like, for how much fun I had in Streets of Rogue, there hasn't really been much of a drive for me to come back to it.
24:55
I feel like because we accidentally beat it so fast, I feel like we kind of saw everything that there was to see.
So like, I have this like thing in the back of my mind of like, oh, like I it's like a a challenge to try to go back and beat invisible ink.
25:10
But every time I go back to try to play it, it's like, I don't know, it feels so, so slow.
And it's it's like a a different version of XCOM, but I don't know if it's a better version of XCOM.
And oh, the thing that I wanted to throw to the group was like a big thing about invisible ink is like, you know, you build up your your characters over time as as you play and they, you know, get more and more powerful.
25:33
And if you lose one, it feels really bad, right?
In XCOM, XCOM or invisible ink here.
There's not multiple characters in Invisible though.
You're managing like three or four different characters at a time, right?
Well, no, you did, Will.
You specifically did a solo Murder hobo play through, right?
25:50
Oh, you know what?
I think I'm mixing up invisible with a different.
You're thinking of fights and tight spaces.
I'm thinking of fights and tight spaces exactly, but I still stand by what I said.
Actually, they're basically those, those two games.
I'm pretty sure I rated them exactly the same, but.
Similar, a decent comparison, that's.
Correct.
26:06
That's a little embarrassing.
Here they both, I mean, there's, you know, had an agent invisible.
You know, it's easy to mix up.
I think I'm going to.
I'm going to put my vote behind streets of Rogue, even though I think that.
I think Invisible Ink is the better game.
26:22
I think Streets of Rogue is the more fun game for me anyway.
It's closer than I thought.
I'm actually going to.
I'm going to go with invisible ink.
My word.
Like, it's closer than I thought, you know, putting them head to head, I'm like, you know, Streets of Rogue was very fun.
26:38
But like, I didn't.
Kind of the same with Scott.
Like I did not go back and play it.
I have never played it solo.
I did not feel compelled to go play it solo versus I beat Invisible Ink.
And it is.
I mean, it's the the last of four of the squad management games, but it's still of a genre that I enjoy more.
26:55
My beard is scratched when I play it.
Well, Streets of Rogue reminded me oh so much of that that the old 16 bit era Shadowrun game, like the old Grand Theft Auto games like the old PC Syndicate games.
27:11
I I'm very excited to actually sync some proper hours into that game.
I will vote for Streets of Rogue, which I think means that oh the listeners influence grown a deal all.
Right, so we have we another, another tiebreaker.
27:28
So Will, you're officially in for invisible then, right?
Not for tight fights and tight spaces.
That's great.
They, they were.
I looked at my ratings.
They were like within .5 of each other.
They're basically, they're very similar.
I would play either one of the well.
I mean, they're not.
Not now.
But I, you know all.
Right.
Well, the the listeners have spoken once again and Invisible Ink is our winner from this category.
27:50
Oh, you've redeemed yourself.
Thank you, thank you audience.
Yes, I think it's the correct call.
And that leads us into our our next match up here between two games that again totally different ends of the spectrum.
One arguably not even on the spectrum, where anytime that I was posting the link to to this to the listener request forum, they would always say why is Rimworld on this?
28:17
Why is Rimworld on this list they mad?
Well, I think part of the answer is that, well during our Rimworld episode we were we were kind of talking about like well if Dor Fortress gets a pass for being somewhat of a Rogi colony management SIM, then surely Rimworld would have to be part of the conversation, right?
28:39
Right.
It's not something you see very often with people lumping Rimworld into this genre specifically because it's very much its own thing.
But it does have that kind of Rogi style of randomness.
Things are different every time, grid based I guess if you want to get that pedantic and and yeah so I think it it ticks most of the boxes to be included in the conversation.
29:04
It's very leaves compared well.
Some of them, anyways.
Well yeah, I mean you know the no one's holding the gun though versus Hand of Fate 2 which was the the bigger, bolder, more feature filled little brother to to its predecessor which couldn't be any more different with deck building, Batman Arkham style combat sequences, annoying narrators, weird mini games and all sorts of wacky quests involved in in I guess a semi open world environment.
29:39
Andrew, did you have much time to to look into Hand of Fate 2?
Oh, I played it super briefly.
This is where I've, I have to reveal now.
I'm well embedded in the show and good luck getting rid of me.
You know, deck building is not really my favorite thing to do, but it was, it was neat that there was, you know, this fighting system.
30:02
You know I think the what's what's interesting about this matchup is that you have one game which is you know very sort of organic and and simulationist and it's sort of you know these different components are made and and and plugged in and away they go and the the designers sort of release the stuff they've made into the wild and and and it just goes whereas Hand of Fate is more fine-tuned and everything is very like sort of designed and you've got this you know these fully 3D modeled fighting characters and everything.
30:35
So it's I I get.
What I'm getting at is that I think that Rimworld is more in the spirit of Rogue like games than Hand of Fate.
And so I will be voting Rimworld.
But the teeny tiny bit I played a Hand of Fate was pretty intriguing.
30:52
I I get.
I get why it's so beloved that and also Dahlia likes it.
So it must be there must be nothing to it.
If she likes it, do.
I even have to say anything here.
I mean, I I guess if.
Yeah, for the audience who didn't tune any earlier, I'm a big Rimworld fanboy.
I think it's the best game that we've played out of all the games that we have played.
31:08
And I that's why I specifically requested given my choice to play a game again that we do this one, 'cause I I don't even I feel like Slit Aspire is so it's holy.
I can't even like bring it down into this podcast.
So the rim world, it's it's on the upper echelons but we can still play it, you know.
31:25
And so I had a really great time coming back to the DLC in particular and it I just it has to win.
It has to win here.
It has to.
Who votes for RIM World?
I I'm also going to vote for RIM World.
There we go.
I I have it are artificially lower in my rankings than I feel in real life because I don't feel like it is if you're trying to play it as a rogue like game I don't think it's quite as good as it if you're trying to just play as a holistic game.
31:53
But I think that especially the early parts of the game do have a little bit of a do have that rogue like vibe.
Like especially if you play it the way that I do, which has way, way more randomness than Will does.
Like I'll often just, you know start off with whatever random people that they give you and just like oh see it, see what happens.
32:18
So like there is more randomness involved in it.
And hand of Fate, like I was looking back, I gave it a pretty good score.
But like I don't feel like it was particularly memorable to me.
I don't like the combat stuff was fine, but if you wanted to have like third person combat, like there are many games that do that very well that aren't.
32:43
It is not shoehorned into a a a weird deck building card game as well.
Both good games.
I think Grim World's better.
Though I think this this might be our first clean sweep of the night.
Well.
I think.
I'm not also going to do RIM World as well because I I went in with this thinking like there's no way Rimworld's going to advance out of this bottom bracket.
33:05
There's no way because it's not a rogue, like, right.
So I went back and and played some hand to fade too because I'm like, you know, I I had some good time with it.
And yeah, that that narrator just doesn't shut up in this one busy.
Like I had been playing again Steam Deck on the couch while the T VS going.
33:24
So it's basically on mute and you can't really hear him.
Not a problem there.
Played it on the computer.
He's just like, I'm trying to read the text of this quest line.
He's like, so by the way, I'm the narrator and I'm the dealer, You should choose wisely.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
I get it.
And then I failed a bunch of stupid mini games in a row and I'm like, you know, Rimworld doesn't have stupid luck based mini games, does it?
33:46
I mean not.
Intrinsically, yeah.
And negative events, but it's all balanced by like an unseen score and and it's it's it's a very elegant system actually but we don't have time to talk about.
That also I'll say to the the folks who are who are, you know, given the the side eye to Rimworld as a Rogue Light game.
34:04
Like just just play it, you know, with just ignore saves.
It's like, it's like the option for no saves and play as the rich, you know, solo explorer and boom there, there you go.
Instant roguification.
Perman.
Death.
34:20
All right, so four votes for Rim World.
Sorry.
Hand of Fate.
Sorry, Dahlia.
And our oh, and so importantly.
It's the Door prize.
The listener vote was also from RIM world, so it is in fact a wide clean sweep.
So even even the listeners wrote in to to rate Rimworld actually pretty high overall.
34:40
So, but yeah, so our door prize from Rimworld, I mean similar games.
First off, we we talked about Dwarf Fortress.
I think that's the most.
Natural.
Wait, no.
We need a We need door prize for Hand of Fate.
Oh, that's right.
What's going right on?
Well, what am I doing?
What am I?
Most likely to need a cough drop for wrecking your vocal cords cause the narrator's blabbing all day.
35:02
I don't know.
Most likely you need throat surgery.
Most likely you need at least one extra hand, most likely your hand slapped.
By me, Yeah, as as the person on the other side of the table getting narrated that.
Similar games to Hand of Fate with deck building plus some other weird thing going on.
35:23
Loop Hero I think has has an element of that where yeah there's deck building going on and there's a lots of like other weird stuff we potential stay tuned.
One Step from Eden is a Mega Man battle network style deck builder, just pretty frantic.
It's right up.
35:39
Will's alley is a game called Tainted Grail Conquest.
A dark fantasy I guess.
English Isles, Pagan Ritual, Demonic, Deck Builder, and of course, Inscription I think is probably, yeah, the most.
35:57
Apartment comparison.
Except Inscription is a great game and you should go play it and not look up anything about it before you play it.
Oh yeah, particularly with its narrator and Batman style combat sequel.
Does that wait?
Does that one count as a?
As a rogue, can we do that one?
Again, I don't think it's a rogue.
Like, I know you're right there.
36:13
It is a really good game, yeah.
It's really very.
Very good.
Well, I think Inscription is more Roguy than Rim World, But anyway, we'll get to that when we eventually do our Inscription episode and everyone complaints about it.
Oh, which real quick.
The door Prize for Streets of Rogue.
36:29
Maybe the Monkey Presidential Medal of Freedom?
Oh, I maybe also a literal door.
That you can bunch through.
I wrote down most most ape tastic for that.
Game.
All right.
Because we did have an entire party of apes who got elected mayor.
So incredible.
36:45
That does feel.
That does feel right.
Oh, and Streets of Rogue.
Yeah, similar games for that one.
We haven't talked.
Well I guess like the one that immediately comes to mind is Don't Starve.
In terms of its like isometric, sandboxy.
It's more survival based but it's kind of the thing that maybe looks closest.
37:06
Other games that we haven't really touched on much but Rampage Knights is a beat em up.
Heroes of Hammer Watch is a very much a open world Co-op game, and Ember Knights a game that's kind of similar in a hack and slash sort of vibe, so be sure to check those ones out.
37:23
But that'll bring us to our final wild card grouping here making Andrew's favorite children fight to the to the death for a winner between our number six seeded the last spell and our #7 seeded Enter the Gungeon.
37:39
Golly, what a, what a what a horrible position I've been put in.
But I understand as the newest host, I I gotta, you know, could be put through my paces put to the test and if handed, you know, a if if handed a lever action rifle.
37:58
And I I got a, you know old Yeller, one of these games.
I mean of course it's going to be the last spell emptying that magazine into into that guy.
Sorry, end of the Gungeon is the best game around folks.
Come on, we're talking quality.
38:13
We're talking quantity.
We're talking replayability.
We're talking oh lovely aesthetic, pulse pounding gameplay to be fun.
It's even enjoyable to watch.
It's too tough for you.
Kick back and watch a stream and have a good time and let the secrets of the Gungeon unfold.
38:32
That being said, I finished the last spell with just under 100 hours, and golly, that game is hard. 100. 100, yeah.
It took me a very long time, and I had to take advantage of one of the accessibility options.
38:48
There's like a feature where you can enable as many omens as you want, and I'm like, yo, I'm enjoying this game.
But the big problem that we discussed during the episode of The last Spell was that, you know, it's a very long game.
It takes a long time.
And I was you know beat my head against the wall and losing after 10 hours over and over again and finally I'm like, I got, I got all the options I want to get to.
39:08
And as someone who's finished the game, I can tell you, I think you all were probably right about the story It's oh, it's it's not it's not the best.
I found it very intriguing and it's a neat set up.
But like the actual execution is rough and the ending is like kind of it's it's it ain't it ain't there but can't wait for the deals.
39:29
I vote for Gungeon.
I think 100 hours is how long it took me to beat the first town.
Whoa, yeah, it's it ain't it ain't.
The game doesn't mess around.
I will say this though, it looks great.
The last spell like bangin metal soundtrack.
39:44
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe the best soundtrack of of these wild card games, maybe of the whole tournament question mark.
It's trailer soundtrack is the Best Song, any individual song of any of the games that.
It's pretty great.
40:01
Probably the I think that like the individual decision making that you make for a round of last spell is also very interesting.
Very tower defence Y.
I think if the one thing that I wish it could do better is randomized map layouts like Oh yeah if you lose and then oh OK like that's fine.
40:17
I'll just restart this town again.
If it wasn't the same exact layout as last time I can kind of get why they would use the same layout and maybe like your your evolved strategy like OK, now I I've unlocked like these stone walls and things that influences my place out and like where to put barricades and stuff.
40:33
Maybe that's like an element of map randomization, but I wish that like, you know and like where the bosses spawn and those kinds of things kind of force it a little but a little more map randomization.
And if the individual like town rounds were like half as long, I think I would like it twice as.
40:50
Sure.
Yeah.
I think randomization is definitely kind of the the game's biggest weakness, because if each one of those 10 hour lost matches, you know, was more varied, I think that would would help a lot also.
I think that you should be able to play the same town.
41:06
I think it should be like.
Each town should be like truly its own unique town with like and you don't.
You're like, oh you have to beat 4 towns before you get to the last boss like there should be.
You should get pulled from a pool of eight towns or something.
You're like, oh, I didn't get to play the Watertown.
Yeah, And I was kind of, you know, being a little jokey earlier.
41:24
I really like The Last Bow.
I think it's really outstanding game to be clear.
Last Bow was good.
Gungeon is gooder though, I think basically.
Will, I would like.
I would like to lodge a procedural or or throw a flag which is throw a throw a flag on my earlier rating.
41:42
I I honestly think that Enter the Gungeon should be ahead of Binding of Isaac which is the the The Division winner.
He's got got the buy.
I don't think like we're not going to be able to compare them as directly so I'm just going to do it now because I I'm voting for last spell.
41:58
I think like Enter the Gungeon is not my favorite game and I really liked last spell, but I think Andrew of the Gungeon is a better game than Binding of Isaac and I have it.
I have Binding of Isaac above it in my rankings, but I think that's because we played it very early and before my tastes had been quite as honed.
42:17
Like I think that Enter the Gungeon is the best in class of the twin stick shooters.
I think it's better than Binding of Isaac and I'm going to throw that out there.
Unlike Colin, my my taste has always been honed.
And so I don't have to, I don't have to flip on these things.
42:34
I don't have to reconsider.
I know, I know.
Intrinsically, it's just immediate.
It's apparent to me.
It's a it's a gift.
You know, some of us have it, some don't.
In this case, yeah, it is going to have to be the last spell between these two here and to the Gungeon, I I know there's a lot of, I get it, I get it it it it's if you like that kind of game, it could work for you.
42:54
But no, I I like your your beard scratchers.
The beard scratchers are always going to have a huge advantage over the action-packed, fast-paced games.
Not to say that there isn't a place for them.
Vampire Survivor is one of the greatest games of all time, but like in this particular case, last spell is going to take it for me.
43:10
It's not a great game again, just another good game.
Last Spell has a great beard game, that's for sure.
This is true that it cannot be argued maybe beard, not a customizable beard.
True, true, right?
Yeah, I think.
But what did the?
What did our?
Listeners.
Yeah, so we're.
We're at another split decision.
43:26
I'll say real quick, I think Binding of Isaac is easier to get into and enter the Dungeon is better in like the long term end game.
Are you crazy?
But anyway, anyway, don't even open that can of words.
I'll tell you what.
Oh my God, that's the wrong decision.
Really.
But yeah.
43:42
So the listener vote for this round and drum roll please is enter the dungeon.
I'm not surprised by that.
Degenerates people like that game a lot.
Degenerates the.
Cold can't be stopped.
43:58
All right.
So that's going to, that's going to wind up our wild card.
Surprised the the door.
The door prize for the last spell is of course one more spell, so the second to last spell.
Wow.
Yep, good one.
44:16
And some similar games to the last spell.
Again, this one was really hard because like it's such a unique type of game that you don't see too many rogue style tower defense games like this.
The closest ones I could find were were Dome Keeper.
44:33
Kind of a similar vibe between doing stuff and then fighting enemies in a in a WAVY way Wall world I have not played but it looks like kind of like Dome Keeper but tilted 90° so possibly steam.
Wants me to play that game a lot.
You know, it's 5 bucks.
44:49
It looks great.
Question mark by this one 'cause I don't know if this is actually true, but maybe Battle Brothers question mark.
Well, you've played a lot of Battle Brothers, right?
It did, yeah.
Any any similarities to last spell?
Possibly.
There's a lot more of dudes that you go through and there's not like a like a a town that you're defending it.
45:08
There's, there's some, the tactical gameplay is somewhat similar, but I think that I would put them, yeah, they're adjacent, I guess, Yeah, they're not, they're not exactly the same, right?
And then my last one here that I I just had it.
OK, yeah, the last one here is a game called Rise to Ruins which has I guess an unlimited demo to it.
45:27
Question mark maybe something, something to sink or sink your teeth into over the over the holiday break.
That's more of a colony management style game, but on a larger scale, yeah.
All right, we're into our Divisional round.
It's getting serious now.
We we have our games that have passed through the bye week and are ready to face their Wild Card winners up first.
45:49
Our number one game that we've reviewed so far, aggregated across the podcast FTL Faster than Light versus Invisible.
Ink that.
Was a better game.
I was about to say this one's got to be pretty, pretty David and Goliath, right?
I don't.
I don't see much of how invisible could go up against against the Titan like FTL, right?
46:10
Well, Will didn't like FTL that much so.
Yeah, I got FTL.
Him.
FTL is at 7.5, invisible ink is at 8.
Oh.
Wow, so, but I must say, so that was my experiencing self, my remembering self before looking at these scores.
Oh, I said Oh yeah, obviously FTL.
46:26
So there's something, there's a bit of a dissonance there between the two.
So in in hindsight, FTL is more fun as it may be the the premise of it is more fun 'cause I do recall with Invisible there being a lot of like things I did not like in particular about it.
Whereas FTL has sort of a novelty and a a zest that was unique but the actual gameplay.
46:48
Invisible ink and you weren't sure which game it was.
I think speaks volume over that over the the, the quality of its.
It's quite fair.
Not necessarily the game itself, but like FTL, is is a is a unique experience.
47:04
There aren't a lot of games that replicate that.
Experience.
I actually had the wiki up and I I remember being very into that game in a very particular way, which I whenever a game makes me get the wiki out, it's doing things that it needs to do for me.
So I'm going to, I'm going to, I I think I am going to go or I'll hold my vote, I guess, but it's pretty obvious it's going to be FTL.
47:23
Like, I guess we have time here to think about, but FTL.
I have to go faster.
Yeah, I wound up.
I remember in our FTL episode, which was ages and ages ago, talking about the Multiverse mod for it, which is a fan mod that's just an EXE they download off the Internet in a very shady back alley.
47:42
But it it is, for all intents and purposes in FTL 2.
With the amount of content and wackiness that's involved, I've been having a lot of fun time with it.
Unfortunately, is not natively supported on the Steam deck, so I had to like, install it on my Windows machine and then stream it over Wi-Fi to the Steam deck on my couch in the other room.
48:03
It works better than than you think it would, but but yeah, it has like all sorts of new alien races, new quests, different like node layouts of the map.
The backgrounds for the star systems look much better.
48:21
I think you can, I mean, you can tell it's a fan mod, but it's a pretty well done one at that, and I think that's been helping me to rekindle my interest in FTO.
I think the base game itself is good, but I think that multiverse mod helps to really breathe a lot of fresh new life into it.
48:40
So if you haven't had the opportunity, I will shell for the FTL Multiverse mod for for folks to go check out and obviously my vote is going to be for FTL.
Indeed, indeed.
Well, it's yeah, it's a tough match up here for invisible ink.
I mean, it's certainly a polished game, but it's going up against like, dare I say it, like one of the Progenitor games, like of the modern Rogue Light, like Scape and like FTL is like, it's it's it's classic, it's a classic.
49:10
But anyway, yeah, I vote for FTL.
Unanimous.
Is it?
I forget what Colin voted for.
FTL for sure.
FTL is still my number.
One game.
If it's the audience pick, then we'll have two unanimous picks going up against each other in the next one.
Oh my gosh.
49:27
Yeah, what was the fan vote between invisible?
FTL just edged out invisible ink according to the listeners of voting.
So it was it was a a a tight race between the two.
But yeah, FTL does make it a queen, a clean sweep to to the semi final.
49:46
Invisible ink.
Yeah, like it's a perfectly promulent game.
But yeah, I think like maybe maybe it's showing its age a little bit.
I haven't really had any interest to check out the DLC 'cause I'm just like, Oh well, maybe I'll try to beat the game first.
50:03
But anyway, what's our what's our door prize for invisible ink on its way out?
Most cromulent?
Excellent.
A similar.
Most static ending.
An empty bag that might There might be something in there, but it's invisible.
50:23
I get it.
Clear a clear plastic.
Bag.
You'd see its name.
Some some similar games to Invisible Ink.
Again a really tough one because it's like like baby XCOM type games but not really like grid based unit management type things.
50:40
Steamworld Heist is a game with robots that's a kind of a side scrolling 2D1.
It's not really explicitly labeled as a rogue type game, but it gets oftenly compared with its game mechanics enough they'll lump it in.
Here Wilder Myth, which is like a a pop up book styled whimsical like what if D&D was in like a happy pop up book universe Seems like it fits the theme.
51:05
Here I'll I'll let the listeners write in and voice their egregious opinions as to why not.
Published by the developers of The Last Spell is a game that almost no one's have heard of called Spirited Thief, which is you, a thief and working in tandem with a spirit to go in on a fun heist.
51:24
And then lastly A Renowned Explorers International Society is another kind of whimsical, whimsical, cartoony looking squad management type game.
Maybe not quite as intense or bloody as invisible ink, but maybe it'd be worth checking out.
51:40
Our next division match up here is going to be is going to be a clash of the Titans here.
Binding of Isaac, our fifth seeded winner or yeah, winner of our twin sticks shooter category versus the up and coming challenger, third seeded Rimworld.
51:56
I spoke too soon.
I didn't realize.
I I I looked at this and I assumed it was already a closed deal looking at these two because it's going to be Rimworld.
But you know, yeah, some debate.
I guess There's no debate.
I don't.
I don't know why.
I mean, I I feel like Rimworld cannot advance because it is not remotely as roguey in the genre as Binding of Isaac is like Binding of Isaac and FTL are like 2 of like made maybe three major pillars with Spelunky that like prop up what the genre is.
52:27
And if Rimworld were to come in like a Wrecking Ball and just go bland with Binding knocking Binding of Isaac out, like, I would feel like, Oh my God, what?
What have we done?
We've unleashed the chaos.
Hey you guys you you let we all allowed it and because it was allowed it must it cannot be disallowed to from the voting process here.
52:51
Rimworld cannot be denied.
Will not be denied.
There is no rule saying that a dog can't play basketball.
Therefore, Rimworld must advance.
We're going to have to get Andrew's Andrew's opinion.
Yeah, I it's, you know, this is an interesting question is at the end of the day, a rogue.
53:13
Like podcast, that's actually false.
That was like the, you know, that's that was the name.
But what what's in the name really?
Just a brand.
Name I, You know, I don't know.
It's it's it's tough to say.
I guess.
You know what?
What?
53:28
Which one am I more likely to play?
You know, probably Binding of I, I guess.
I vote for Binding of Isaac, I suppose, But I mean, that's fine.
Everyone's, we're all friends here.
Everybody.
Everybody likes it.
No, no, no.
You have just put yourself into the degenerate category.
Unfortunately, there's a vast rip between US and you.
53:44
Now I'm going to vote.
For RIM World, thank you because because I know that it'll lose to FTL in the next round, so I'm not as.
Concerned about going on?
Let's let's not get arrows over here.
I I feel, I feel guilty about it.
Also, I'm assuming it'll be a tie and hopefully the the the the listeners leave it up Binding of Isaac and then I won't feel bad about advancing Rimworld.
54:07
Don't leave it up to them, Colin.
Don't leave it up to the mass.
I'm voting for Rimworld, so you should be talking to Scott.
Well, Colin, if we're if we're going to leave it up to the listeners.
No, we're not actually, because you're going to vote as you should here, step in.
Line No, I'm I'm going with Binding of Isaac.
54:24
I put I like and I say this as someone who's like kind of like basically done with Isaac because I accidentally beat it.
I beat through Mega Satan once with like all of my roles lining up and like I'm never going to get that lucky ever again.
54:40
Don't care to try.
And I went through and I I I beat like the standard ending and I was like Yep, that's that's perfectly good of an experience.
I if I was stranded on a desert island, I would much rather play Rim World because I think it for me it has a lot more interesting stuff to experience for the first time.
54:58
It probably has much longer legs to it, but it would feel sacrilegious to to vote against like.
And you know maybe Isaac really hasn't like aged particularly well against other games that have come out recently.
But in terms of like something that's easy to pick up and play and just go for a a Rogue style run with, for me it's got to be Binding of Isaac.
55:20
So that's going to kick it over to the to the listeners, to tiebreak through wills.
Listeners, screw me again.
I'm going to be real upset.
Well, lucky for you, Will, because the listeners have bailed you out with putting RIM World above.
55:36
Wow.
The problem is, it's just a really good game.
It's not necessarily a good rogue like, but it is a good game.
It's kind of.
Cheating.
It's It's like AI.
Don't know.
I'm struggling to think of a good football metaphor here.
What was it?
Tom Brady inflated the balls or deflated them or did something like it's.
55:56
I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was but I feel like Rimworld is like it's it's juicing the ball somehow to get through.
But it will get caught before the Super Bowl.
So don't worry that's true.
Excuse me, Omega Bowl?
Oh my.
Yeah, copyright, copyright, pen and penning.
OK, so our next divisional match up here is, oh, this one's going to be tough for me.
56:18
Oh, but real quick.
Dead cat door press, right, for Binding of Isaac.
That's that's that's it.
The door.
The door prize was what?
Dead cat.
It's just a dead cat, yeah.
Great, poor Guppy.
Yeah, similar similar games for Binding of Isaac.
I had to split this kind of up because I think the most obvious similar game to Binding of Isaac is Enter the Dungeon, but I also have similar recommendations for that as when we get to that eventually.
56:42
But Binding of Isaac?
Similar games for that are formerly titled Monolith, now titled Star of Providence.
Very much in your vein of room styled twin stick shooters.
Amazing game for sure.
Stay tuned Void ago, which I was hampering on in our Axolotl episode.
57:02
Just this is an example of like breathing new life into this kind of genre.
It's absolutely insane and have to check it out.
Synthetic with AK If you want 80s style robots and obtuse reloading mechanics, you got your jam there and then.
57:21
I'm going to lump Patch Quest in here because I feel like it hits the same vibe of room based twin stick stuff.
It's very much it very much looks like a A we wear type bullshit game with all of its colorful cutesiness.
Not even.
It's like the exact opposite aesthetic to Binding of Isaac, but it plays very nicely.
57:41
It did not play so nicely when Will and I tried to do a steam like remote play together thing, but as you can tell, the Internet here probably wouldn't have stabilized in any way.
So those are those are some homework assignments to go and check out other than for the Gundam shortly.
57:59
But first we have to jump into our next divisional match up between Dead Cells and Cog Mine.
I was shocked that after our Dead Cells episode, it ranked up so highly, So highly in fact, that it almost mathematically tied with FTL.
58:15
It was just just barely, ever so slightly lower.
But I was kind of impressed at how how highly that those were present ranked the game.
And I have to say, like, since since we did our Dead Cells episode, I downloaded the DLC.
58:33
Super fun.
Well worth it.
Very much Loving the the aspect of all the new arenas and biomes and boss fights and all those things.
And I think it it helps to, it gives me a lot more to play with than what I was originally playing with which was already a lot.
58:49
And yeah, like I I have been trying very hard to get through some of those DLC places real tough.
But it definitely has that pull of oh OK, I lost that one.
I have time for one more before I have to make dinner, right?
59:04
Yeah, I'm going to say like, Cogmind will always have a more special place in my heart.
Like, I'll look back at Cogmind more fondly than I will about Dead Cells.
Like, I'll remember my time playing, but I think Dead Cells was just more fun to play like Dead Cells was like, I mean, I'll pull from Will Cogmind wins in the Remembering Self, but Dead Cells wins in the Experiencing off like playing Dead Cells was a joy, and playing Cogmind is is also fun.
59:33
But like, it it it's fun in a way of like, oh, I remember this cool run thing that I did versus Dead Cells.
Like, yeah.
And then like the second I lose that run, I'm like I forgot what I even had.
Like.
I am a dead cell, remembering nothing but that it was fun, so dead cell's going to take it for me.
59:49
I played.
I actually did play Dead Cells for a little bit.
And yeah, I I as soon as I realized that this is one of those unfun games that otherwise known as the platformer genre.
The entire genre like Terraria, The only exception, I think 'cause it only kind of it fits into that category.
1:00:10
But like just a severely unfun platformer.
I I just can't I can't get into these games.
Cog Mine is going to have to clearly get my vote here.
As low as it rates it's better than the terrible.
I I just it's so hard to get into one of these these these terrible games like like Dead Cell, Dead Cells.
1:00:32
Has prettier art.
I agree.
No, I agree.
I agree with that.
Despite that, however, despite.
That no, actually I was quite impressed with Cog Mine's visual presentation.
Like listening to Y'all's episode made it sound like, oh gosh, this is going to be like one of those real jank fests or just really simple.
1:00:52
I was I was literally expecting ASCII graphics which I mean the way the items are but anyway but like I thought that they they did some interesting stuff with like the animations, how things are presented in the map is revealed and things and and whatnot.
But anyway, again, this is my vote is super extra subjective and biased and cuz just based on what I know about the games, which is I played cog mine for 45 minutes and thought well that was pretty enjoyable and I played some more and then Dead Cells I've played a lot of and I've enjoyed a ton.
1:01:27
Yeah, I mean I.
Think my official vote is maybe also gonna go dead cells to deadlock it.
Wrong.
Tied here.
I love it.
How much?
It's not deadlocking it.
It's we're kidding.
The, the, the I vote dead cells and you vote dead an.
Omnipotent NASA coming to our rescue?
And I say I say Dead Cells with with a Heavy heart because I feel like even Cog Mind is #1 on my list.
1:01:49
But like .1 rated higher than Dead Cells, which what does that even really mean really?
I think if I was stranded on a desert island I would play Cog Mind instead of Dead Cells, but like, I don't know, like I'm looking around my desk here for a coin to flip, like it's it's really that close between the two, like there's completely polar opposite game.
1:02:07
But let the let the audience decide then.
I mean really, they've proven themselves to be not be degenerates.
So I mean, depending on the the actual vote, but like, you know, maybe they're good here.
We'll see.
Should I?
Change my vote in the House.
Think of the drama.
1:02:23
Think of the drama.
This is a podcast.
You have to have the drama.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
We got to go to Factor.
OK, I'm gonna.
I'm changing my vote.
This is how close it is.
Really.
Now look at that.
I'm changing my vote from Dead Cells to Combine.
I'm I'm gonna go back to my number one game on my.
Life.
We already you already know the outcome, though.
1:02:38
That's the sad.
Thing I know that's the problem is because you already.
Have read Who's Gonna Oh wow.
I know what I want.
I know what the community vote is.
So I'm kind of biased with both ways, don't you?
You.
I do.
Yeah, I.
Am we can vote for my knowing the dead cells will win.
Yes.
Well, so if if we throw it up to the community here, do we, I don't know.
1:02:58
Like Colin, where's your challenge coin?
Do you have it?
It's somewhere nearby.
We flipped it for.
For what?
Like the?
Are we going OK?
We want.
We're going to go heads, Heads is deads.
Do we want octo thrust or do we want a picture of a plane front?
1:03:17
I think picture of a plain front is in.
So we're going to, we're going to do plain front is dead cells.
All right, this is how close it is.
Oh, it's a plain front baby.
Oh, OK.
Challenge accepted.
Dead cells wins.
Wow.
All right, so for for the record, the community vote was for Cog Mine.
1:03:33
But again, I'll leave that.
I didn't see that.
I didn't see that flip, by the way.
I don't know if I trust.
I saw it.
I saw it.
Will I my recollections.
You don't even like Cog Mine.
No, but I don't want dead cells.
But you just hate.
I feel so.
Much hype.
It's got too much hype.
It starts disrupting the nature of things.
1:03:49
He's.
He's upset because dead cells are going.
To be Maybe it's a little overhyped.
We need to have one game that Will hates going to the Omega Bowl.
Oh, we already.
I mean, of course it's going to be at least one game that I hate.
That's probably true.
I didn't expect Dead Cells to to be out so fast, but I guess like, I mean we're getting into that, no?
1:04:08
Dead cells in cog mind is out.
That's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
I mean, like this is the part of the tournament where like every game is going to be real good.
It's going to, It's going to be very hard to to pick a favorite well.
A the plus side is that we can, I think pretty clearly to give the door prize the distinction the the very important distinction of best rogue like Yep, Oh yeah and hey.
1:04:33
That's.
I mean, Dungeon has dread more.
I mean, I mean.
Yes.
I don't know better graphics.
The The Door prize that I have written down for Cog Mind is our 2023 hidden gem of the year and the way that I calculated that out was our our aggregate podcast rankings versus how popular the game is on Steam and our aggregate podcast ranking is pretty high for this game.
1:05:00
This is, this is, yeah, like one of our one of our top ten.
And popularity wise it's nowhere close to the top ten.
So the gem rating pulls it out of the top by quite a wide margin.
Similar games to Dead Cells or God Cog.
1:05:16
Mine, it's right next to the other one.
On you really want dead cells to die, don't you?
For and we have like we have a laundry list of traditional style rogue like games to get into, but I think for ones that are that pass the Berlin interpretation of all the stupid check boxes but actually do have some kind of accessibility that you're not just using your damn keyboard the whole time for sure.
1:05:41
Stay tuned and possibly the ugliest game that we may ever play, Tales of Mahjay Al I'm.
Excited.
For that, Dahlia will be too another one.
The Steam release of Ancient Domains of Mystery ADOM is one that actually has some print accessibility on Brogue, despite being ASCII first does have title sets available to install, or I think it's a menu option or something like that.
1:06:05
And then obviously The Caves of CUD makes it on that list in terms of grid based turn based permadeath RPGs with with some great aesthetic to it.
So our 2023 hidden gem of the Year we bid you and you.
It pains me it I got it's a dagger in my heart to move dead cells on ahead of cog mind.
1:06:26
We got to do it.
We got to pick a winner here.
It's the coin has spoken.
The coin has spoken.
That's true.
That's fine, That's fine, so long as the next one the the next of the of the two.
Yeah, the next one's going to.
Be contentious?
Yeah, our final divisional game here between our 4th seeded and winner of our deck builder category, Monster Train versus our wild card winner, Seventh Seed.
1:06:49
Enter the Gungeon.
No contest.
Give it the monster train.
It's a good game, great game. 22 Train going to the end go.
Come on.
Who was all aboard?
Come on, here we go.
I mean, I'm just happy to see and enter the Gungeon, get in this race, really.
1:07:08
But what I will say is that, you know, on a train, come on, the theming.
I don't know.
The aesthetic, I don't know.
I mean, well, Oh my God, in order to play a video game, you got to look at it.
And.
Monster Train is rough to behold.
1:07:27
I do not just agree.
I I, of course am, you know, going to vote for Enter the Gungeon, but I I understand that of course the majority will.
Rule and for the record.
What Scott's going for here?
I don't.
I I mean, I just looked at it a minute ago, but I don't remember what the community vote is between these two.
1:07:47
So I don't, I don't have that bias in the front of my brain right now.
I think this one is closer than I thought it would be.
I mean, I had been playing more Monster Train on the couch than Enter the Gungeon.
But I'm going to have to vote Gungeon and spill it out to the community because I think, like Monster Train has a lot of really great game design mechanics going on with it.
1:08:09
There's a lot of, like, really smart ideas in the game.
And I I just really like playing like I just I played it in another.
Mechanics or not your style, I I understand Scott.
I get it.
Hey, you know when you get a really broken combo going and you just feel like you literally can just suplex the.
1:08:27
I don't.
Yeah.
It's such a great build.
And then you got like all of your people on the train and they're just like going together.
It's great.
I agree.
Broken.
Combos.
But there's something when you get when you get into that zone in Gungeon and everything just feels like it's locked in and you get into that flow state, it's just like it's hypnotic.
1:08:48
And I you just can't break yourself out of it.
It did take me a lot longer to get into Gungen than I think.
Monster Train.
I think Monster Train had an easier on ramp into the tutorial junction.
But Gungen, I feel like once once you get it, it's like, Oh my God, I I finally see what everyone's talking about now.
1:09:08
And you're just zipping in between the bullets.
You're shooting your Hunter's bolts, you're swapping guns, your backpack reloading.
You just got everything going for it.
And yeah, I think like the the aesthetic style between the two Gungeon is just it's it's like Michael Jordan Duncan on the kids in that YouTube video.
1:09:27
Like it is even remotely closed.
Enter the Gungeon is better themed but mad 'cause bad, so I don't like it 'cause bad at it.
And also Monster Train like I would play Monster Train if it was like an ASCII text like list of things happening.
1:09:46
I I would play it if it were sprites moving up just like Donkey Kong style level like original Jumpman level.
It might be better that way actually.
Yeah, like, I do not need to.
I would.
I would play if it was like Monster A versus Monster B, like I've just for the mechanics alone.
1:10:04
All right.
So we're we're split decision again.
I'm really glad I got these community votes because like, if no one actually voted, this would be we'd.
Have to go to the coin way more, yeah?
The coin would be doing a lot of deciding for us, all right?
So I don't remember what the community voted for this one, so I'm going to go and look back right now between Monster Train Enter the Gungeon oh, Gungeon is the community vote.
1:10:24
And for context, Monster Train was at the bottom of the list of the community.
Oh.
Big mistake.
Great vision, those lists.
Betrayal on the rail?
No, I I you know to say some nice things about Monster Train is that I'm not hugely into deck builders, but I was able to jump in and start having some enjoyment right out of the gate, right off the platform.
1:10:47
But just I I I'm sure, I'm sure if I played more of it I'd have more appreciation for it.
No, I did.
The aesthetic is not so bad, you know, clearly, like you know some some talented people worked the on the art, but it's just this weird combination of like being derivative of existing properties and then also just.
1:11:07
Lays the buyer with.
Looking too much like a weird Instagram ad you'd get for.
Some game, it looks like the games that are on the side of your website, yeah.
Furthermore, just the theming is so bizarre to me.
It feels like there be so many other good.
1:11:24
You're an antihero.
I mean, it's the you are on the side of hell, trying to stop heaven from wiping you out of existence.
That is neat.
But then putting it on a train doesn't make sense to me as much.
Like if it was like Years of the Abyss and you're like fighting like big battle over like it's a, it's a, maybe a.
1:11:44
Silly.
We all got around somehow.
It should be a moving.
Castle trains are.
It should be like Howl's moving castle, and they're infiltrating from the ground and they're working their way up to the pinnacle of the castle.
That would at least be like thematic a layer, a moving secret layer.
Well, what's our what's our door prize as we derail the monster train?
1:12:04
Best shopkeep?
Have you seen that robotic cat and the noises it makes?
When I was a child, I went to a Mariners game and they gave out these whistles.
They were like wooden square whistles and you blew into them and they were like a very cool, like Choo Choo Choo noise because you could hear the Choo Choo train go by Safeco Field or Kingdom or whatever it was.
1:12:29
Monster Train gets one of those whistles.
A toot on the whistle.
Yeah, I think some similar games to here will do.
You have a pen and paper down here.
Have you heard of this game?
Slay the Spire?
I don't know if you.
I don't.
Probably not.
Up Will's alley.
1:12:44
It kind of.
The graphics look bad.
There's no story to it.
You're you're not a devil.
You could go for the other one downfall, which when you play as the villains you try and beat the heroes.
That would actually be more thematically similar.
Also a good game.
Also AI mean also 10 out of 10.
1:13:01
Slave Aspire, the Downfall mod, both strong recommends Vault of the Void I think also kind of fits into this deck builder.
But deck builder like specifically as as like deck builder versus type game.
Another one that probably few have heard of but has a very interesting aesthetic to it.
1:13:21
Maybe also up Will's alley in terms of anti hero death related stuff.
Brutal Orchestra is a is a deck builder slash God, how would you even describe it?
Like almost kind of a JRPG style combat.
1:13:38
I don't know it's very it's very weird.
I think it's kind of fun.
I don't know I really haven't made much progress in it.
But a more another one that's more kind of along the lines of your standard deck builder of fighting games.
Well, I don't know if it is standard, but Ring of Pain I think falls into this list as well.
1:13:57
I think all these are for sure.
Stay tuned.
I think I may have done Will's homework in terms of the next recommended episodes on his.
I feel embarrassed right now.
I just looked at my hours played.
It's it's less than 1000.
It's like 960 hours for Slate Aspire and I have more hours in Squad at 1260.
1:14:15
And so that's that's how I know something's wrong in the universe.
Wow.
You just have to open up Slay the Spire while you're playing Squad to idle it in the background.
All right, Roberts had too much of an impact on our our gaming life.
I.
Think Yeah, I wonder how many hours in in Slay the Spire, Robert to see.
1:14:31
OK, Semi Final #1 FTL Faster Than Light, our number one game of the podcast so far, versus debatably a rogue like Rimworld who's going to the finals.
You know what?
Better choose Rimworld here.
Otherwise, we've got no true winners leading the the, the fight here.
1:14:49
Rimworld I don't think everyone else is a.
Loser.
We got a bunch of losers and we have Rimworld.
That's I think I I don't think Rimworld advances, no.
Holy shit.
Oh.
Unless Andrew pulls a wire old card here and is like, you know what Rimworld did have some compelling arguments for it.
This election is doing already.
1:15:09
So yeah, I mean, again, it's tough to argue.
It's like the godfather of of genre, of the genre.
It's that FTL is, it looms so large in this space and yet at the same time it's like well, which which one is more impressive?
1:15:29
You know, I would argue like FTL is pretty simple, but you know it, it's it's, it's an important game and it is, you know, arguably more fun in certain ways.
So I don't know, it's tough to say.
Tough to say, certainly.
I mean, I'm going to say that like, Rimworld is one of my favorite games of all time, but FTL is also one of my favorite games of all time, and FTL is inarguably the better rogue like game.
1:15:57
I think that I'm talking.
About fun This is the fun rating that's all this.
Is no.
Yes, it is.
That's all we've ever been interested in is fun.
You know, I did not have fun in Rimworld when I was trying frantically to have one of my colonists pick up a gun from somewhere on the map.
1:16:12
And it's just like, oh, in order to do that, you need to form a caravan, and you need to have them equip the gun from the caravan menu.
Like, wait, what?
Like, why can't I just control F?
Good scrub.
It's very.
Simple, Mad.
But we've already established previously on this Exact podcast that Mad Cabot is an acceptable reason not to like a game.
1:16:32
True.
Andrew, are you doing OK?
It's all out of you.
Over here.
That's all.
Don't worry about me.
Oh, this has been quite the quite the spirited episode.
Well, interesting.
Which one do I think Enter the Gungeon could be no.
1:16:55
This.
Is what it's come down.
To I put a lot of stock into the number of devs.
Do we have any idea how many developers Rimworld has versus how many FT?
Oh no, I forget all this Tom.
For me, it's not a solo dev.
I mean, I look, I I I have respect for Y'all's respect and mastery of data and mathematics.
1:17:17
And I ranked FTL higher than RIM.
Significant.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just think about this for just a second.
I could potentially vote for Enter the Gungeon in the next.
I'm undecided right now.
Oh, my collusion.
Collusion.
And I gotta tell you what, I'm feeling dead cells unless I feel there's some strong reason to vote.
1:17:37
Wise.
Oh my word.
This is a very this has turned into a rogue, like all its own.
This ranking system is its own game.
I somehow knew we were gonna have vote colluding going on here.
Sure, sure.
I I sorry all everyone involved.
1:17:53
I never thought, you know, 10 years ago when I played FTL for about 30 minutes and angrily quitted not to play it again.
Over a decade that I'd be on a podcast such as this with fine group of folks, I'm voting FTL.
Sorry, Dead Cells looking really good to me right now.
1:18:08
I gotta say, I'm scared.
It's really excited about that game all of a sudden.
Well.
Look, I'd love, I'd love to see Rimworld win.
That would be hilarious.
Like how to win the Rogue like Omega Bowl.
But I, I, I, I think FTL is a storied game.
1:18:27
Chiseled in in the in the the very rock, the bedrock foundation like.
If there was a more explicit like, oh, here's the thing, if Rimworld had an adventure mode like Dwarf Fortress does, then I think it could be more seriously considered in the genre.
1:18:43
And I'm sure there's like actually.
Use caravans to go places and do things and have it be enjoyable.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
But it's not like it's like you could.
I don't think that.
I don't think that the caravan stuff works well.
Yeah, so yeah, maybe maybe there's some meta game that you can kind of trick yourself into thinking, like, well, if I do it this way, it's kind of roguey.
1:19:01
But I also feel like the one reaction video we got from our Shattered Pixel dungeon map review, the Internet would tip over itself of like, Oh my God, this Rogue Like podcast rated.
We can't consider ourselves with the degenerates and what they say.
1:19:19
We really can't.
Thank you for voting fans.
And what was lovely?
Degenerating himself.
He's either scratching his scalp over here with his weird scalp scratcher.
Will's going to love it when I give FTL or slay the Spire a solid 9.0 on my ratings when we eventually get to it, instead of an 11 out of 10.
1:19:38
All right, Rimworld, we're sorry to say goodbye.
You are quite an excellent game, but we're going to have to give you some door prizes.
On the way out is consolation.
It's organs harvested.
Prisoners.
Or skin or, yeah, organs.
Or skin really.
Or some kind of Oh yeah the the opioid like smoke or not not smoke.
1:19:57
Leaf.
What's the like?
Yeah, flake.
Yeah.
Well, yayo.
Yayo's pretty good too.
Now Yayo takes too much manufacturing cost.
We all know flake is better.
High higher yield per amount of time you put.
In just going to say it's a better high, everyone knows.
Yeah, but yeah, yeah, you would if if you personally would rather be on Yayo.
1:20:15
Give me that Go juice.
Tell you what, Mainline that stuff.
All right.
Here we yeah, What do we got?
All right, so similar games to Rimworld.
I kind of kind of snuck it earlier.
But obviously Dwarf Fortress is the number one comparison.
So there's actually been some recent development with rogue style colony slash city builder game that are actually more in the rogue vein.
1:20:37
One of which that I think just today maybe one point O to out of early access against the storm we had a listener write in requesting us to to take a look at.
I've actually found like a decent tutorial video for once on what the hell am I supposed to do in this game?
1:20:53
There's a lot going on.
It definitely has like will write min maxing management simulation written all over it.
Another one is dot age or dotage.
I think is the supposed to be the pun where you're an old old man.
It's a turn based colony SIM with like Super Nintendo graphics that's very charming.
1:21:14
And then maybe another one that's kind of on on the the spectrum of colony builders, but keeper RL for Rogue Lake.
That one's supposed to be well regarded as well.
Yeah, Rimworld, I'm surprised actually made it this far.
I didn't think it was going to make it out of the first round.
But hey, you know, semi finals, that's not too bad, right?
1:21:33
Incredible what it what it's showing.
That brings us to our second semi final between some heavy hitters, Dead Cells, and Enter the Gungeon.
You know which game I've always loved?
Dead Cells.
I'll tell you what, ever since the beginning of time, I've loved that game.
1:21:50
Since I've been my favorite, and this game offers so many choices and synergies and other bullshit that I'm going to have to go with Dead Cells.
I think, yeah.
Well, it's true that Dead Cells has the most slay the Spire reference.
1:22:07
Oh, that's it's true.
You can't play.
I'm not surprised, Will, but you're voting for that and I respect your decision.
But I'm biased too.
Check it out, folks.
Just last step we had.
Oh, what an authority.
Woody Wiskowski was on this wonderful podcast, and he did.
1:22:30
For those of you who don't know, an entire podcast covering the entirety of the Nintendo 64 game library, Woody knows his games.
Did I mention also that he's beaten Battletoads, so he's also good at games?
And in this decision, Dead Cells versus Enter the Gungeon.
1:22:49
All we need to do, we need only look to Woody's wisdom and according to Woody, Enter the Gungeon is in fact better.
Well, it's a good thing Woody's voting today, so.
Oh no, I just, you know, I again you all are are are mathmens.
You know, data science is very important, and that is a data point you can point to and say what's the Woody scale on this?
1:23:12
Well, you heard it from him and you're hearing it from me.
Enter the Gungeon is game.
I of course I'm gonna vote for Enter the Gungeon.
Think for me, I'm gonna have to go Dead Cells because Dungeon has a lot of things that I really like about it.
1:23:28
But it did take me a curve to get over the learning aspect of like what am I supposed to do.
And I think some things that for Enter the Gungeon, because I came to Gungeon after Dead Cell, we mentioned it in the last episode for for Dead Cells that I played.
1:23:43
I played that at PAX as like like a beta or alpha stage and it was just like, boom, immediate.
I was like, I know this is going to be an excellent game.
This is going to be a game for me.
Enter the Gungeon.
I didn't have that immediate hook and I'll admit it grew on me.
1:24:00
But there were some things about Gungeon that as I was playing it, I was like, man, I really wish it did something like this.
And then the thing that I was thinking of was something from Dead Cell, Like, you unlock a thing and then boom, it's right there in front of you.
Like, oh, maybe I'll, I'll try experimenting with it or I guess there's enough teleporters in Gungen, but it feels like I'm still running around the arena a little little too long.
1:24:25
Gungen feels like I have less control over my the direction that I want to take.
My character's build maybe feels a little more random in that aspect.
But yeah, I think I'm going to, I'm going to go Dead Cells.
I think these are both two excellent games, but for me Dead Cells just kind of click faster.
1:24:44
Well, I'm torn here because I liked Dead Cells a lot more, but I do hate collusion.
So I feel like I want to know what the community's vote was so that I can either vote against Dead Cells so that the community vote put Dead Cells into the winner's bracket, or vote for Dead Cells so that Dead Cells goes to the winner bracket.
1:25:05
Blame it on them, right?
That makes I.
Feel.
Smart.
We the the same pattern must hold.
I I believe we have to have very consistent formats in our vote a year.
Does votes don't count over there?
Which I've been shoehorning in you know compliments to the the games that I have been not voting for.
1:25:26
So I want to do the opposite here.
Just to sort of keep things balanced into the Gungeon.
Why don't they just give you a description of what the guns and what the synergies do you got to have the wiki open all the time?
Terrible.
There's some guns that are like a joke so bad.
Why are they even in the game for you What else?
1:25:42
I don't know.
The Co-op mode is a little jank but overall it works Anyway.
I'm.
Going to vote for dead cells and and and just ignore Will's, Will's temper tantrum over here and.
For what it's worth, the the community vote was for Gungeon.
Andrew.
1:25:59
See.
The community knows.
Last time you betrayed me.
You have learned.
To listen to you today.
I was, it's a shame, you know, you didn't listen to the last episode.
I you know, I was I was going to put, I was I was going to put dead cells above Rim World.
1:26:16
But I I I kept Rim world in spot #5, which is too low.
I realized it should be much higher.
Could have been number one.
Yeah.
So our door prize for Gungeon?
Best Best D&D puns, Maybe?
Probably a gun.
Best Punch.
1:26:31
Probably some kind of gun.
Yeah, I'm thinking so.
The Grogpod Gun.
That makes sense.
Similar similar games to Enter the Gungeon.
Obviously the number one would be Binding of Isaac I'm pretty sure, but some other ones, because we already talked about that would be a Nuclear Throne I think is a pretty a pretty close contender.
1:26:53
I haven't played, it's free on Steam.
I should probably give it a look, but I believe Relic Hunter's 0 Remix is supposed to be close in top down twin stick shooting to enter the Gungeon.
I'm also going for games that I didn't mention for Binding of Isaac already, so something like Atomic Crops could be considered a Gungeon Adjacent type game.
1:27:14
It's very different, but but in that same similar style vein, I think if you like Gungeon you might like that game.
And of course mentioned it again during our by complaining of the Axolotl episode Tiny Rogues, I think is definitely worth looking into if you're into this kind of frenetic bullet hell.
1:27:33
Yeah, if you're into good games.
Probably.
Check these ones.
Out indeed.
All right, our Grand finals.
Between our unsurprisingly #1 and two games so close in, our ratings for for the season and the grand Pappy FTL Faster Than Light.
1:27:52
Pulling in on our number one of our squad management category versus our #2 just Barely, barely #2 ratings wide and leading pulling.
Doing its damnedest to pull the platformer category into relevance for this podcast is Dead Cells.
1:28:11
The game which one of the present hosts didn't even play?
Very good.
Yes, the Grand finals, of course.
Got to.
Respect.
Who didn't play Dead Cells?
Like this?
Yeah.
I don't know who who didn't I played.
For just that I.
Thought it might.
It might have.
1:28:27
Piqued your interest but.
Did you play Dead Cells for longer than 10 minutes?
Maybe about that much.
I mean that's.
All you need Some games, just don't click.
Again, this is all just fun reviewing games.
Very.
You guys are making this very clear that you're right.
My opinion for dead cells last voting round was really inflated.
1:28:45
I have to.
You're right, I'm not to pull that back a bit.
I feel like FTL, you're right.
You're making a lot of very good points out there.
It's.
Really taking the number one spot for me right now, I had a lot of fun with that game.
Actual real fun.
That lasted more than 10 minutes.
It's true.
What a deal.
1:29:02
What a deal.
Well, yes, this is a grand old fun old time, I do declare.
So this is, this is an interesting matchup, right?
Because we have kind of the the old guard, the old captain's guard, the best of the best, having sort of founded this modern genre stacked up against a more recent new blood release, Dead Cells.
1:29:22
Very indeed.
That's all I have to.
Say it's interesting.
I feel like this is this is kind of a dead cells versus cog mined redo for me in terms of like how I feel about both of them like dead Cells but in the moment FTL deeply memorable game.
1:29:39
Like I can at any moment turn on the FTL soundtrack in my head because it's just like burned into my brain versus dead cells.
I don't I'm sure it has music but I don't remember what it is.
1:29:54
I don't remember if it was good or not because I don't pay attention to that music that much.
So the fact that I I like FTL is it's just it's it's in there and like FTL is in many ways like the first rogue like game that I played.
I don't know.
I'm, I'm still torn.
1:30:10
I'm still deciding.
Yeah, don't let, don't let the recency bias affect you here, 'cause, you know, keep in mind, like, we were just chatting, what, a few days ago in this past week anyways.
And just like Dead Cells, I never want to open that game again in my life.
I hate that game, I remember you saying verbatim.
So I think that's that's for sure a thing that I said in the last week.
1:30:27
I will.
Say like you don't want to open that game again though.
I will say like the FTL final boss fight can be kind of, can be kind of bullshit because yeah, it is.
Yeah, there there was this one time I had like this great ship build going.
I forget which what ship it was but had this great build going.
1:30:44
And then I had come up against the final boss and oh, they had the, I think it was the the module that disables one of your one aspect of your ship.
And they shot it at the one that was that I used for depleting Shields.
1:31:01
And we were just like deadlocked in, like it was a complete tie game.
And well, actually it was like I did.
There's a Google Sheet that I have somewhere of like, all right, I reached out to, like, the FTL subreddit as well, like, is this mathematically possible to win?
And I did like this Google Sheet math like, oh it would it would be theoretically winnable, but it would take like 2 weeks of just letting the game run for me to win it or something stupid like that.
1:31:27
Of like with you playing it that two weeks.
Yeah, and and like timing, so like hitting pause and unpause to like time between like missiles and things and like everything like perfect in order to get like just the millisecond timings between shooting like the shield disabling weapon and like firing a missile to like drop in and like getting all those things timed out perfectly.
1:31:48
Like it was mathematically doable, but not practically doable.
And I thought at the time, like, you know, I had like, I had the strategy one and then it was just like this random nonsense thing at the very end, which I think is kind of like to be expected in this genre.
1:32:05
And it's not really the game's fault, but it made me really mad at the time.
Yeah, but remember Tilt Town?
I do remember tilt down.
I left my heart there.
How?
How could I forget Tilt Town?
Oh to contrast your point Colin, after our Dead Cells episode and I had put in the clock tower theme as our play out.
1:32:25
I had that music playing in my head non-stop for like 2 days and it was it was just such a like between that and like the Ramparts music where it's just like the drum beat the like the strumming guitars and like the music just comes together so perfectly in that game with like your character run it like Ninja running across the rooftops.
1:32:45
And the speed involved.
It just feels so, so locked in and perfect that like and oh and like the Castle music too where it's you have all these other like themes from other levels like blended into the background.
I had a really hard time picking what play out music for Dead Cells to to do because it was just like Oh well this one's really good, but this one's also really good and I have really good memories from this one.
1:33:11
FTL great soundtrack.
Like undeniably good.
And I will say like the the multiverse mod also adds more more good soundtrack to that game.
But yeah, I guess I'll come to to Dead Cells Defense in the in the soundtrack department a little bit.
1:33:26
I mean, that's good music, but I don't think it's as iconic or as thematic as the FTL, but.
Certainly, certainly.
I don't think we've talked well.
We've talked a little bit about this but maybe we should talk more about story and not so much storylines of like the specific plots of games but the story that develops out of a unique run of a rogue like game.
1:33:50
And for me I think that is very important in but that is that is really the magic that lies that animates rogue likes and sort of makes them unique and interesting organic great fun tales you can tell whether they be tales of victory or tales of defeat at the hand of the rebel ship that has disabled your anti shield weapon or what have you.
1:34:13
And there is very little emerging storyline to be had at all in dead cells.
Whereas in FTLI have very fond memories of, you know, that one specific random human guy or that one specific random rock man who you know, put out the fire and saved the day despite having never actually beaten FTL.
1:34:34
Like, I've had so many wonderful stories and tales and things that live on in my memory.
And though Dead Cells is flashier and more fun in certain ways, and to quote Colin feels good to play, I think I have to vote for FTL for for the story.
1:34:59
Yeah, I think I have to go with FTL as well.
Like it's just such a classic like formative game for me and I will always remember it.
Fun.
I I would be interested in revisiting both of the games like a year from now.
I wouldn't Dead Cells.
It's quite so fresh in my mind because you know, definitely things can change and how you like.
1:35:18
I don't know what my remembering like how how I will feel about Dead Cells after having not played it for a while because that hasn't happened yet.
So I know FTL holds up.
Well, I forget.
Did you?
Did you vote for one?
I voted right away and I voted with passion and with a purpose, remorse.
1:35:39
Oh.
Yeah, right.
Well, I think that I'm I'm happy to be an outlier for Dead Cells and I'm not.
I'm not upset if FTL takes the crown 'cause I think it is well earned.
I think it's it's legacy is well deserved.
Yeah.
1:35:54
I think you couldn't go wrong with FTL as like your first experience in this genre.
And again, like none of these games in this bracket are are bad, but maybe it's getting a little long in the tooth.
But I think the Multiverse mod does add a lot to kind of spice it up and fresh it up a bit.
1:36:11
So if if FTL is gonna gonna wind us out here, I mean, we still have to do some door prizes for Dead Cells the The Deadest Game.
I'll give that boy a head.
Yeah, cellular game.
Your prize is it's it's prizes ahead.
1:36:27
Oh OK.
I do have a door prize written down in the Google in the Google sheet for the the best individual background music song that we have for for the season being the clock tower one which was the one that I was.
I was doing the very clever like TikTok.
1:36:44
Your time was ticking down and no one, no one at the.
Time got it.
Yeah, that's right.
Fix it in post, but that was just like when I when I heard that the first time.
I think it was in like one of the beta releases and like that came on and that was that was like the last stage at the time and it felt like a monumental like epic countdown of like oh it's you versus like the big the big boss.
1:37:07
Oh my God.
This is like it is incredible.
And like listening to that again just sends shivers up my spine.
So I'm going to send that one as the best best individual song.
I think soundtracks we've we've been very blessed with very good video game soundtracks this this season.
1:37:23
And yeah, I've been putting them all up on on YouTube Chan for similar games to Dead Cells.
We kind of talked about this as fresh as last week but Rogue Legacy One and Two Skull the Hero, Slayer, Spirit Fall and I'm going to say Blazblue this time to balance it out.
1:37:44
Blazblue Entropy Effect.
Give those a look.
If you if you want something that's quote UN quote, A platformer Will, but maybe also a different style.
All, all good entries in the genre, but that's going to wrap it up.
That's going.
1:37:59
To hold on, hold on what?
What's the grand prize?
What's the prize for winning?
Oh, sure.
Also, did sorry, did we get the audience vote?
Oh yeah.
Also, I want to know what the audience vote is for the.
Like I want, I want the best what What's their number one pick?
Should I just read out the the audience votes?
1:38:16
Sure, just.
Between these these two, I think like what we've done before.
Oh, OK, yeah.
So the audience votes between these two dead cells was pretty low actually, surprisingly.
And FTL was #2 on the community vote list.
1:38:33
Was Gungeon #1?
Number one was Cog Mind, believe it or not.
Yeah, See, see.
People love Cog, mind.
It's it's just People's Choice.
Indeed, indeed.
But yeah, that I think like the grand prize for.
Is the Omega Bowl of.
Course it's Yeah, we gotta ask.
We gotta get like a a fruit punch bowl to to mail them or something.
1:38:51
But but yeah, the the inaugural, the inaugural Omega Bowl winner is FTL faster than like kudos to a job done.
And yeah, I I had thought about like possibly sending them or the the devs A postcard from the Seattle area.
1:39:11
Be like Congrats on making a great game.
I'm sure they get like a million postcards a day.
But yeah, I think.
We still like your game.
Yeah, it turns out one of the most popular games that has spawned a new genre.
Hey, guess what is still probably pretty good?
1:39:27
You should go check it out.
But for real though, if we had FTL against slate Aspire.
Well, Slate Aspire is the secret hidden last boss we've only unleashed.
It's like when you beat the heart the first time, or when you beat the the last boss the first time and you still die because you have to get relics.
You can fight the real heart, the the real last boss.
1:39:44
I mean, there's still challengers in the Wings, Slave Spire, Hades, There are games out there.
Right.
We shouldn't actually weigh in on that, right.
So that's getting too little tension here.
Well we're going to we're going to have to wait till next season our our so yeah before we get there quick social plugs, our emails, grog pod zone@gmail.com.
1:40:03
We're on Mastodon Grogpod at game dev dot place and grogpod dot zone is the website.
You've all heard this before, but yeah, maybe if Slave Aspire happens to show up in our in our next season.
Season.
We'll have to pit it against our our top ranked games in the Omega Bowl 2.
1:40:20
If it gets that far, we'll have to if it even if it even makes the top, the top A.
Dirt your house down if it doesn't.
You know, real world made it pretty deep.
You know, Slay the Spire is going up against something like Void Ago.
It might be a toss up.
We'll we'll have to see.
1:40:36
Void A What?
Void E Go.
Void E Go.
Yeah, that's going to, that's going to wrap up our our season one of episodes.
I'm going to include the, you know, the the 2022 episodes into season one because we're still getting our bearings.
But anyway, yeah, season one boom is done.
1:40:54
We've done it.
We've survived a whole season.
Hooray.
Our next episode.
I don't know.
We might.
I might do a chill, happy, happy Groggla day season episode of reading some e-mail from listeners or something like that.
1:41:10
I have.
I have find the most.
The most holiday spirited what's Yeah, what's the most holidays themed rogue like game?
You know, I think I have an.
I think I have an answer to this.
Is there a Santa trying to, like, worm into houses, Rogue?
Like game.
There is a traditional rogue like game called Alpha Man where the final boss is you fighting the Grinch.
1:41:33
I love it already.
So, yeah, we'll, we'll.
See, can we can we get war, the War SIM creator, and can we get an interview with him, 'cause I tell you what he seems very responsive.
And I I just watched his most recent, like, you know discussion and he's, he's got a lot going on up here and I really like his style.
1:41:51
I don't know.
Maybe think about that.
Very possibly.
We do get a lot of requests for us interviewing game devs and I'm always hesitant to do so because be like, so why is your game bad discussion?
I mean in the case of war SIM though, I mean there's no way.
That we could possibly go that route.
1:42:08
This is true and we've already done all the rankings and ratings and stuff.
So we we we we've already spouted off what we need to do.
So we'll we'll figure out what we want to do for our our holiday special episode.
But join us in 2024 a whole year from now for our next season of of games that we will review and fight each other to the death over.
1:42:31
Yeah, they think that'll do it for this one and to play us out.
Of course we'll be our some more music from.
In this case we'll we'll do a tune from the Multiverse mod, because I haven't spouted it enough From the multiverse mod to FTL Fasting Light our season one Grog Pod, Omega Bowl champion.
1:42:52
We'll see you next year.
1:43:16
The None, the, the.
1:45:18
The.
1:45:47
The.
