greetings friends and welcome to a totally normal episode and a totally normal introduction to the going rogue gaming podcast The Grog pug roguelike podcast where we are a roguelike podcast talking about roguelike games [Music] I'm your host Albert and with me are my Rogues galleries of co-hosts I I am your totally non-normal gorilla eating bananas out of a garbage can of course uh and I am a warrior traveling around in a loop yes uh this is this is oh College all right my name is they already know our names yeah well I mean introducing yourself as an ape is probably debatably more accurate yeah yes yeah it's the it's the core the core of your being and while we while we are still recording in ape Grill uh we have to combine both Abe's and April fools because it's not a totally normal episode it is a surprise double feature episode where we are covering this episode on both streets of Rogue and loop hero to uh two very good games uh we'll jump into streets of Rogue here first released July 12 2019 on Steam Xbox PlayStation switch developed by solo Dev Matt dubrowski down in Los Angeles uh and published by uh the the publisher tiny build who have done uh a game called a hello neighbor which is I guess very popular there's but I've never heard of uh cluster truck I am bread speedrunners and I'll throw it into the uh the list anyway because I'm interested in looking at it spider hack which is a fun fun sounding uh name of a game uh this let's see streets of Road cranks in at number 49 on our list in terms of popularity of reviews with 17 842 total reviews will your big Quest is to free three trapped gorillas who will tell us in one gorilla sentence what one does in streets of rogue uh all right well in order to solve this Quest I think I'm gonna I'm gonna hack the terminal inside the room that's gonna allow the security door so that three Gorillas Attack all the scientists and then they give me their secrets and their secrets uh would be this um as like a a summary of what the game is is it's a pretty classical like roguelike game with the exception of it being uh not real time or not I should say not it is real time not turn based and so it's so you're going through a bunch of floors I'm not sure if you're ascending or descending um but it's got like a really interesting meta progression where you're becoming the mayor maybe eventually and along the way you are causing a lot of damage to a city and killing a lot of people and stealing a lot of things um it does it does feel like a repetitive game in in a very strong sense but um definitely has a lot of synergy building and uh I think a a really fun multiplayer aspect that we got into that was way too long of a summary but that's that's kind of how it is yes this is this is a very interesting uh gosh I don't even know how to like put my thumb on it like it feels like you said I think it has like a lot of your your uh roguelike stables in weird item identifications uh lots of open-ended sandboxy nature to it uh and yeah like complete chaos uh have either of you played I mean the answer to this has to be yes and I will be dumbfounded if it's not both of you have played Streets of Rage before Greg which one is that negative no I mean maybe this the side scholar Genesis beat em up and uh whose soundtrack I listen to while while working maybe like well I didn't know every other day yeah it's like a Genesis what are you in one of those rich kids coming soon apparently there's some streets of Rogue two coming too yeah coming soon yeah I think that I'm I am pretty hyped for that uh there's a lot of stuff in streets of Rogue one here that I think is is super interesting but I don't know that it's like fully am I wrong to say that like it it doesn't feel fully polished yet is that right am I out of line with that like it is fully polished like the game plays very smoothly but it feels like it's missing something yeah I would say that it's definitely I I would say that it's fully polished is kind of a weird uh uh like it didn't feel like it was missing UI interface stuff um or that it played like it was poorly optimized or that uh like it it felt like the gameplay running around felt smooth um it did feel like maybe it was missing uh you know what it is all the levels kind of feel the same like there's you go from different zones from one zone to the other and they feel they're like slightly different but and then there's a couple different obstacles and there's different like color schemes and bushes or whatever but that you never break off and do something like completely different um well they tried to solve that I think they that you're exactly right um and they try to like you can see that they they're like oh well the base game is kind of boring how do we like spice it up and so like every three levels there's like a random event happens it's like is this kind of like added spice around ultimately at the very core of it though the mechanic is you you go to a level and you have like two or three objectives and that's either kill a person or retrieve a thing and so you're going into buildings avoiding some traps killing a person or grabbing a thing and you're just doing that same mechanic dressed up in different ways over and over and over again and I think that that's probably why it feels like it is a complete game but at its core that mechanic is just not fun enough well I think like the the mechanic or like so we're describing mission objectives and of the the various uh floors I think they're I think they're floors it's weird because like you're not ascending a building really um or no uh no they're listed as levels what am I talking about uh you have uh the slums level industrial park downtown Uptown and then finally the mayor's Village but each of these stages or levels I guess are broken up into like three um it's Mario Style yeah worlds and there's three levels in each world but like if if I had to like it would it would take effort on my part in order to say what the difference between like the park and downtown levels were I mean like they are different there's different stuff in them but like from a tent like if I'm looking across the room here at my computer monitor I'm like squint like yeah I can like kind of tell that like that they're different um lots of rectangular rooms all these uh rooms are procedurally placed around around this map and like the theme of the map kind of dictates what's going on in like around outside the room to some degree like there's mine cards in the industry level or there's uh like cannibals hiding in the bushes in the Park level like those kinds of things I think that's really what in Seattle yeah I like Seattle um uh I think that's what it is the there are differences in the outside world but once you go inside the buildings which is the majority of the level then it stops being quite so different level to level like there's always the scientists with the apes and the cages there's always the the club or the lab where you have to like go through the flamethrower things it doesn't feel substantially different from from one level to the other and honestly I feel like it may have even just been better if they had pulled some of the available options and put them into only this world like oh there's just no scientists in level one or something um almost in kind of like a a cog Mindy in fashion of like you start with like you're kind of intro stage here that has more little limited options then you go to the industrial one it's bigger there's more stuff to do like I was almost kind of expecting that with like I think it maybe gets to that with like Uptown in the mayor Village but I was kind of expecting like the final level to be like you know okay like all the stuff that you've experienced so far it's all here and you have to use all that stuff to your advantage but um but yeah I think like the the real magic here so the the mission objectives are pretty basic go and go and do X at Y location to get Z reward and they're all kind of randomized but uh each character that you pick has their own unique big quests associated with them and that can be something like if you know you pick the the gorilla character your big quest which I think is optional question mark yeah they're all um uh is get more experience points first you get more experience points I think you get better rewards for doing them so there is like a decent incentive to as the gorilla go and find those locations where the other gorillas are being held captive and release them like that seems like a good fun thematic uh approach to to that kind of character based thing I kind of wish that was the default and that like the the like Mad Libs missions were the optional ones

yeah that wouldn't be enough though they'd have to restructure it so that you there was more because the big Quest is like one quest of what would usually be like three quests and so freeing all the gorillas is like yeah that's like one Quest worth of stuff uh characters there's there's I think an interesting array of different characters that you can select in this game uh ranging and each one feels very different to play I think in our uh shared uh run through this game which we were accidentally very good at uh we didn't really spend much time like trying to see like the different synergies between them but which is aped out basically just pure ape punching everything and it works really good yeah

uh well I will debate your debate ape uh your claim that the gorilla being the best character in the game because I don't know that there is a best character in this game they're worse well that's also a good question uh Scott how many hours have you played this game by the way answering these kind of things I feel like uh I haven't spent a ton of time playing this game but at the same time like each run like I feel like this is this is this podcast episode is a tale of two wildly different games but um streets of Rogue is like a story of two wildly different play Styles if you're playing Solo versus with people yeah I agree yeah I mean so uh My Confession is that I only played it in the multiplayer mode so I pre I'm pretty sure I had a completely atypical experience um where I had like it was a fun beat em up run around Smash and blow up things you guys were you two were apes and I was a slum dweller and I was just like shooting things with all the guns that you left on the ground because you didn't need them so I was like never running out of ammo which I'm pretty sure is a real concern in the in the main game uh and you were always just busting through walls so I didn't have to worry about like being sneaky because there's no way that to hulking gorillas can sneak so she's like I'm just following cleaning up your mess um but I'm pretty sure that's not how the base game plays like trying to avoid attention and there's probably a whole different game that I just didn't experience yeah I think there's there's so many different ways to experience streets of Rogue like it very much is like a a wacky action sandbox that every time you go in feels different but it still feels like it's missing that kind of like um like okay I'm I'm jumping in this session in order to do this kind of kind of hook for me um I think in in our instance it was more of just like all right let's just like pop in and see how far we can get uh with the expectation like yeah we'll die and then we'll try something else but we we accidentally beat the game on our first playthrough which was probably not the intended Behavior but uh yeah like like how much is the difficulty curved like do they add more difficulty if you have multi multiple players almost done I think so I I didn't think that way to me because as far as I can tell from stalking the uh streets of broke Discord Channel like we didn't even play like the most OP combination of characters even like if if you pick the soldier class who's kind of like your standard um beefed up like good with using ranged weapons starts with like Bazookas and stuff or whatever uh the the soldier class can actually help with like field revivals and stuff like even more so than we already were doing of like in this game I think it's done well where like if someone dies you can kind of like ghostly follow them through the walls and then when they're ready like you can donate half your health to them or pay off of you know some such amount of gold to like fully revive them I think that's a smart system but like there's some character classes that just like skirt around that completely and like just make it way easier to to revive your teammates um yeah and we got a lot so and there was an instance where like we almost like we can't like a Razor's Edge away from Death like yeah and you just like snuck around the level for like 15 minutes well we watched sneaky ape um but yeah like the our I think our um I was gonna say local co-op experience but not quite uh I think streets of Rogue graduates from the same school of uh risk of rain with its baffling uh uh local co-op controller setup uh yes maybe I'll say um I tried getting uh and also like I tried it took some effort to get this up and running on the steam deck uh and once once it got working it was working quite well um but I still need to to use like the touch screen to like start the very first thing which isn't a big deal but it's it's just kind of like that extra little step that I'm like um but yeah so we did what did we do we did we just did normal multiplayer but it was like a weird thing that you can get to it right because you tried originally doing the steam uh like fake local co-op thing right yeah that was the way to do it and then we actually just inside a different menu yeah uh but turns out you can't really do that I don't really understand how steam local multiplayer web multiplayer thing works I feel like every time we've tried it it's never really worked I think we need to find it or a game that it it seems to work more natively for because I I tried again this is like another like bizarre hacker setup steam deck in the living room with four Xbox controllers hooked up to it like trying to emulate like okay what would it be like if like people were over and we were trying to do like a local co-op thing and that was surprisingly difficult to set up too again yeah like weird hacker Edge case because of Linux box but Etc so I think in in our local co-op instance there there was a lot of good um balance between like downtime strategy and wacky media where every every stage that you're on so like you start in the slums there's three slums levels but like the first two were just kind of like okay quote unquote normal uh just to like let you get your your feeling and bearings around like okay what am I supposed to do how how is this Gonna Roll out and then the third level is the the zany level where there is a uh I think they're called disasters um yeah ranging everything from like ooze that just like starts spreading throughout the map and does damage to people to police lockdowns to missiles falling from the sky to I mean the one that we played that was my favorite was the like random potions and just like everyone smell you're paralyzed or you've turned into a giant you can smash through walls like that was like Peak Zane um zombie apocalypse is a fun one too though like just oh yeah that's turning into zombies and yeah there's uh there are some mutators or options that you can turn on to like have that just be like a permanent mode where that's on all the time and as always at first I was like oh that should help that should be how the game is by default but actually no not at all because like in single player mode like it almost kind of feels like uh Metal Gear Solid 5 in a way of like okay I'm gonna like I have this relatively simple Mission objective but I have like 20 different ways of going around doing it but I want to like use the window cutter to like smash open the window and go in from that direction do I just want to Bazooka my way through this wall or uh if I'm like playing as the zombie character do I just want to infect like 10 friendly zombies and then have them burst through the door for me and like do all of my bidding instead there's a lot of different like I think thoughtful options where if you're playing with two or three other people in a local co-op setting it's maybe more fun for just like wacky zany uncontrolled chaos uh but you also pay the price of oh [ __ ] like everything is just like spiraling out of control and now like the whole map of mobsters are running around chasing us with guns and yeah multiple times where I would just be like doing something and then you guys would come running and there'd be like 10 guys chasing you what have you done I thought we were I thought we were going to be sneaky on this one no sneaky was never an option gorillas I mean come on yeah

um but yeah like synergies between and I think that like you probably can do like a quote unquote serious playthrough where like there was one recommendation of like oh you if you pick the investment banker uh character along with the shopkeeper the thief and the jock the shopkeeper can supply the investment banker who like the you can like borrow from the other player at like a like a lower gold rate and then the thief will supply the shopkeeper and then the jock lets the thief into places by like breaking down walls and the investment maker can help The Jock lose enemies like there's all like these like dependencies between all the different character classes that gets very uh very interesting um but yeah I think like my my question to that is almost like well okay that that sounds like fun in service of what though and am I overthinking it of just being like well like yeah that does sound like fun it does sound like a wacky chaotic environment but like is is there like something that we need like more like of a meta progression uh like gold words or is like the zaniness like the goal in and of itself good enough yeah I feel like it would be if we were just like let's just hang out and play a zany game for a while um uh they could fill that void like will and I play a lot of Rocket League it could be someone's rocket League where it's like you know every you know every once in a while every like once or twice a week we get together and we play uh serious Rogue for an hour and we just go smash Hulk through stuff or you know we try and figure out if there's a different way to break the game um I definitely feel like it had of it was a very fun in like a dessert way like it I don't feel like it had it didn't scratch my like deep thinking brain itch especially the multiplayer mode maybe the single player is more on that if I'm almost certain it is but the multiplayer was an arcade game it's almost like a goat simulator sort of a thing where it's just like whatever you guys play Goat Simulator no I know what it is though okay you didn't play the uh the MMO uh parody one where it was like in a wow map uh no none of not none of the various goat Sims you you haven't lived uh well it's it is a flash in the back it is a dessert it's like everything you're doing is a novel thing but you only want to do it once and then you're like okay very funny cool interesting but like the novelty dies right away and I think that that's exactly what happens to this game the novelty for the like 15 levels or whatever like no the novelty dies very quickly and so that's why they have to keep putting in all like you know new crazy Shenanigans but like even that it's like you just adapt to it right away um and in some sense it feels like this is almost just like a whole game based on like The Legend of Zelda like the first time you encounter a shopkeeper and you like steal something from him and you're like oh I got away with it and then you come back and he like kills you so it's like this whole thing is like well you can do whatever you want but you know there's some kind of consequence and like it's just kind of like learning about this morality system um within the game but we do have another game to get to too yeah yeah so speaking of dessert games let's switch to our uh go ahead and say just potatoes a delicious delicious potato yes so our our second game surprise uh of of this episode because we accidentally beat streets of Rogue the first time we played through it uh okay one final note with that we did like an ape mayor so I guess that does that does uh that boost is like one or two points on the rating scale for sure uh loop hero our second game for the day um released March 4th 2021 on Steam Xbox switch the epic game store if you so desire uh good old games and the Humble Store uh developed by the four quarters team out in Russia and published by uh who is this uh devolver digital uh yeah who were they I've never heard of that yeah um with uh uh a mile long list of notable games uh of which several stay tuned for future episodes including inscription enter the gungeon downwell cult of the Lamb almost are not uh episode for next time uh that's almost why I picked it honestly because I saw the devolver did it I'm like oh well if they're publishing is I mean we and Spirits Abyss I mean we have like a a dearth but I think like between devolver and maybe clay entertainment probably the the the two development Studio that maybe have a nice representation maybe yeah um it was a loop hero ranks in uh at our number 26 game on our list uh popularity with 30 679 total reviews Colin how will you play your hand of 13 cards to form one sentence about what one dozen Loop hero one sentence well the first thing I'll get rid of like five of those cards so I have a slim down deck because

I'll play them and then my guy will go around and around and around and I'll watch him battle because that's what you do in Loop hero uh the three things you do I mean that's really there's the One Core thing which is your guy loops around any battle stuff no and then you pick what Loops you pick what stuff goes on you you pick his outfit for him and then his outfit okay

you pick which uh Roadie goes around you put the shops on the side of the road and then you pick his outfit and then he no I'm just kidding um yeah you you pick the stuff that he fights basically uh based off what's on the road that you loop around multiple times and I'm making it sound really boring but it is a very interesting game and there's a lot of nuance in in how that all plays out with itself um but I feel like there's there's something about Loop hero that at first I was kind of met on where I'm like okay like why am I collecting sticks and stuff like I don't have any idea what's happening and then I realized like oh I'm just the character in the game not understanding what's happening and I have to go and fight this uh this Lich who is uh causing the heat death of the universe question mark yeah something like that

he's he's just just like entropying the the rest of the universe into nothingness and you're forgetting and you have to like find a stick that doesn't immediately turn into dust once you touch it like that's the like literal goal of the game it's like finding Pebbles that don't dissolve into dust stable things stable Metals stable just things that can survive the entropy slowly rebuild an island of civilization against the Lich that's that's the third thing too so I mean you mentioned the first two which are you picking you're picking your outfits you're picking your synergies of the things you pick up from the items along a loop second thing is you're placing down you get you have cars that you're drawing and you're placing them as tiles almost like Carcassonne um just kind of like building out a map making sure that they fit into the right places and so that's all like that's all the action side of things so the two things you do there and the one side you do on the meta progression side is like you're building out the your home base and that's kind of like the third thing that you're doing but that's about it you can't have you don't I love Auto Battlers I love the idea of it um and I think that this one could have added maybe a little extra to that um in the sense that like you'd love to be able to like press something to have some kind of impact you know do the one thing that you saved up for you know I'm not trying to have a lot of impact here but let me have some influence so I'll uh I'll start off with I like this game a lot um but when I was I was playing it again yesterday and today and the thing that I found the most frustrating was that you can't influence what kind of equipment you get really it's I like I would just start being like yeah I've got such a good I've got so many counter things and like doing counter Synergy and then I'd be like well I got a new good thing but it doesn't have counter I guess I just don't use it oh but just just gotta wait until another good thing with counter on it comes up like oh I'm trying to get a bunch of things for defense and be like well I just hope I'll get defense stuff and there's no it it does seem like there's very little control over how like what direction you grind towards well okay so will shaking his head what I mean by that is like okay so I was just on the bus uh playing playing Just brother he I need more Loops uh that just needed one more Loop to get uh God what is it the thing that you get for fighting like four enemies at a time uh or an explosion yeah one of those guys I'm like okay I need one of those guys in order to build out like this next new building for my cam and in order to do that I need to fight like at least four Dudes at a time which necessitates me getting lots of that's right you guessed it things with Thorn damage on them were damage to All Enemies um at least well that's that's my interpretation of it let me just you pick the road character you stack evasion first and then you go to damage to all and you get your little wolf buddy I'm like okay everything's lining up but like and I was getting like some you know decent like damage to all thorns gear for a little bit up until like maybe Loop level four or five and then it was like I'm like okay well where's my thorn stuff here like where's the little butt like not even button but like lever that I can press in that direction to be like okay I want more Thorn stuff but like is this is this like the aspect of um because we can't go like more than 20 minutes without talking about Cog mind like you know how income like you you have like a pretty decent build going and then you're like oh actually I need like I need to like Tech switch into this direction because either like the enemies have dictated that or I'm in a part of the map that necessitates it or like it like my gear has just fallen off that's not the same kind of deal here though is it I feel like Cog mind the entire game is built around the concept of totally rebuilding your character at certain times versus Loop hero is built around going around a loop bunch of times and the fact that you rebuild your character sometimes during those looping is just something that happens it didn't feel it doesn't feel like they still get blown off your body right right they're not focused it's always optional yeah so like I would I'm I I'm gonna compare it to our other uh every time we think compare things to things is slay the Spire like I feel like slay the Spire has a little bit it has like a better mechanism for controlling the direct like you can push for synergies in a much more controlled way and like you have cards that you got in the first round or in the first stage that are still extremely useful to you in the last stage versus a level one weapon with the best possible defense or counter or whatever is 100 [ __ ] right by loop three and that awesome new gear you got Luke 3 is the worst possible gear by Loop five and so you are completely replacing everything and just it I felt very it felt very difficult to keep a consistent build going that's a really good point uh about like the difference between the two and of course latest buyer best game of all time and so like that's that the fact that you yeah you do get that one card at the beginning of course you upgrade it later but like maybe some they could have done something like how do you fix that with Loop hero where it's just like yep two or three Loops later that thing that was great is now [ __ ] and you have to like complete get you have to completely replace how many item slots you have it's like well that it starts with four that's an interesting thing by the way yeah like four or five but like or with the you know with some of the things that you get but like yeah maybe some upgrade like maybe like Diablo really I think it feels like this game is trying to steal from Diablo with it's like oh here's your item space and like you know you only have so much so many things you can keep at once and like you know you're always upgrading you're always having to make decisions about like oh do I want to keep the lower level thing that has the Synergy or it kind of feels like they're leaning on that but maybe if they would allow you to like turn those things that you don't need into some attribute or some kind of upgrade for the thing that you actually want you're looking for a 100 Cube aren't you I'm looking for her here's my strong suggestion for the Roger cube is while you're going around this Loop you're collecting all these resources and the resources have no use unless you finish the loop or retreat and I would I I just I hate retreating uh so many times I would die because I'm like maybe I can get back to camp and retreat with all my stuff but even then I don't want to I want to go try and you know get to the last boss I feel like you should be able to grind your gear into Loot and then use that loot to upgrade your character so maybe you finish the loop but you don't bring as much back to Camp Brilliance that right there that sounds like a really great trade-off because there's so many times where I'm like there's literally like oh [ __ ] I'm I'm really low on health like what can I do to improve my character literally nothing um I want to be able to sacrifice a resource in order to continue on be like and maybe make it really expensive be like Oh I'm gonna use half of the resources I've got in order to full heal myself or something it's like well you know my Loop is busted for uh for meta progression but I might still get to go fight the boss I never beat the second boss

it's hard I think I've gotten I've gotten stuck into like the base building stuff at the moment there is no base I mean it's a very like by Base building I mean like um building out or like I guess like teching up maybe is what I'm trying to describe because like there's only one Tech thing that you need and that is the info building so you can actually understand what the hell is going on in this game Colin what is what's the bit ones I should say set of buildings that you need there's a right answer here I'm pretty sure it's the crafting store I don't know you're probably a building I haven't unlocked yet the watchtowers the Watchtower yeah I didn't even get to that point oh my yeah the the watch that like as soon as you get like four watchtowers you want to upgrade them the Watchtower just for those for our viewers at home uh it's a a thing where it's like the loop starts at a campfire and it goes around and it goes back to the campfire and so it starts at your camp Camp like your your base that you're building up right is that is that correct uh I always whatever says like slightly maybe sure um but then if that's the case in the year of War kind of breaks down because the the like king or the is it is it a lich I'm not actually sure

you're feeling glitchy he's a lichen he's a witch lichen okay okay uh he's not growing on the side of a tree so I don't think he's when he when he like first lands he like has a palaces that like destroy everything around the main area so it doesn't feel like it is like actually around your Camp it kind of feels like it's maybe slightly different but I understand anyway the point is that like these watchtowers they make it so that they've unupgraded the first the tiles are right around the campfire they just are support fire they come in and they just kill whatever's there for you or they assist and so when you upgrade them it's two tiles out so two tiles in both directions is like where you stack all of those enemies to get those orbs of transformation the ones where you have to have four plus enemies interesting stack spiders all spider cocoons everywhere fills them in with these low level things you just [ __ ] clear them out and you just get all those orbs and it just like it's it's the easiest way to make it tons and also they give you all the cards all the items that you need and I don't know my finding was that like the meta progression that I've or the strategy it developed like worked 100 of the time like I don't I never I basically never lost after I discovered like the way to like play the game well so I'm 10 and a half hours in and I'm not even at the building before the Watchtower wow I haven't even unlocked the info center so I'm obviously just bad at this game I remember I was at it I was playing for a while and then I was like wait a second you don't need to have all these things and I was just like I was like just packing just like placing cards as much as possible and it's like I don't know I'm just dying every time um and it's like it's hard to get sick I had a hard time figuring out where you wanted to put stuff like yeah I need to find balance like there was uh and like every once in a while I should be like wow I just got stomped here like I thought I was doing so good and then just oh four goblins in a slime and a vampire just crushed me I was uh the I was playing through this game the first time like totally blind like I'm just like okay I'm just gonna let the game happen to me and I'm not gonna like cheat by looking at the wiki or anything uh and I had the exact same experience where I'm like okay I have a card therefore I must play it uh and like man I'm just getting I'm just getting beat like real bad every time I'm like okay well I'm gonna stream some for you you're gonna tell me what I'm doing wrong here you're just like nope nope nope nope yeah well all right tell us what's up and then what happens what happened when you played that round by the way man I just just so happened to be the first boss for there we go there's so so what's the good Strat is it like don't play cards and let them just like build through your hand and turn into the like memory fragments and just like go around the loop a bunch of times well it depends on the character you're playing and so I did like as soon as I got to The Necromancer I saw an obvious Synergy between necrom and I know neither of you got that dude I just I just unlocked him for I'm like one metal away from unlocking them the thing you experience right away is that like unless you can like get your your basically you start the game the combats and then like you start spawning your your skeletons and if you can't spawn your skeletons fast enough like in other words they they your enemy is killing those guys things out and they're attacking you then you just die you lose every single time that way and so you see oh attack speed attack speed is what makes you so you can crank these things out faster and the the forest in the game which is a tile you place gives you more attack speeds I was like oh right so you just want tons of attack speed don't get anything else none of the other things the river is good if once you unlock it because it like can double the effect of the the Forest which is the attack speed but basically you just do 100 like alt attack speed I think by the end of the the game that or the when I actually beat it I had like something like 250 plus 250 like attack speed and so you're just like spinning these things up yeah five skeletons as much as possible um and then you're also just doing the strategy where yep once you're able to focus on attack speed you want to do um and this doesn't really matter to you because because you're not actually have done the decorative answer but like you want to make sure your your skill your level your skeleton level is like at equal to equal or greater than your Loop level and then everything else has to go into skeleton quality or summon quality and so nothing else matters evasion doesn't matter defense doesn't matter the second boss and you're playing as a rogue uh you shouldn't probably shouldn't do rogue in general I mean I don't know I didn't but how else am I gonna get that sweet sweet satisfying item dump every time I go to go to camp and it just goes like my inventory again I didn't find there was to be too too much of a huge difference between the two um uh I think there are some once you start leveling up your dude maybe that's the third thing it's actually four things the fourth thing you do is like when you level up in the game with the little experience meter you choose like the one of three things that you get and so I guess it's fair to say that's the fourth thing you do um I feel like I would put those the base building and the the leveling up of your dude during a run on like a sub tier like I mean yeah and the placing the cards feels like they're so much more what the game is but but in the the actual selection of those those traits are responsible for like when I beat the game like you have to like there's certain s-tier traits and if you don't get those your run is basically done and so like unless you when you get hit if you're if the Damage Done to you it gets like evenly split to all of your summons oh my God that's like way way better than like the one where you spawn two extra skeletons at the beginning of the game or at the beginning of the loop like those things die immediately that's like completely worthless and so I don't know there's definitely a lot of Tears when it comes to that and so I liked this is where the fun for me in this kind of game is discovering okay we've got a bunch of things like we just upgraded a level presented with three options I don't know what's good and like being able to like test it out and say okay well this one seems like a big oh man that was total [ __ ] I didn't it didn't react the way I expected to and then being able to do it over and over again and be like oh now I have a very strong sense of like these are the S tier ones like you just get them right away and you don't have to think about it plus one skeletons oh yeah obviously you need more skeletons or I don't even know summons or whatever they're called but uh yeah uh there's that to me is where a lot of the fun of the game is like isn't that Discovery and that's why reading the wiki kills absolutely kills the phone out of these games if you're copying someone's Strat it's just not a fun game it's all about so and maybe I shouldn't be saying anything then because I've just ruined the game the problem sorry about that everyone the problem I had was that uh it's the same problem I have with a lot of pixel art style games where I feel like the style of the game overwhelms stability to impart content um like I was just genuinely confused about what was what for a while yeah um like I found it hard to like I I hate like hovering over multiple different items trying to figure out which one's the good one which one has which thing uh like I'm not really sure which which creature gives me what kind of resource yeah that's frustrating and I felt like it was I ended up just going to the wiki to look up you're like what what exactly what what enemy gives me what thing like things since it's an auto battler things are like flying around and doing stuff you're like uh it's like there's some noise that happened like what was that noise yeah look what did that Ding uh and then like something flies up and you're like wait what which monster gave me something like I'm just looking up the resourcing like I have all these things I have no idea where they came from and like I mean I figured it out eventually but it was very confusing at first like what since it's all moving quickly it's hard to tell where what's coming from where and Owen were you also playing on 400 normal speed like absolutely yeah I think I switched to that right after like yeah I was doing 200 or 300 and I'm like no maximum yeah so that's the other thing too it's like is it's a grindy game um The Grind is satisfying but like you know the first couple things you're just like all right let's let's pick it up dude let's run around this Loop faster like I want a track star I want him to be just absolutely sprinting around this Loop uh but like I I think that a lot of pixel art games suffer from this which they have like a really good aesthetic uh but then they're like but we also have to have pixel text which is hard to read uh and I made that criticism against cognine and then immediately it was like I wonder if there's a mod to fix this and realize that you can change all of the text in cognine so I do have to retroactively like give that small point back to cogman of like it did it right it has like a cool default text and then you go and be like I want to just be able to read things easy Colin did you notice the two other option or text options that were in God damn it are there really yeah there's there is a like I think it's on the main menu uh like in the upper left wow you know your standard like uh pixel art text which I think is fine all right you know I had to give this the thing I have to open up this game right now and I have to see how obvious is it am I just like really bad and do I just need to look at this every single time I think it's it's like it can be Lincoln you miss it sort of thing like if you're like just opening up the game and you're just like yeah hit that new game button like right in the middle you can pretty easily uh miss it but there is like there's a um there's like normal text yeah yeah there's like a like uh like a Sans serif like normal yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I see it it's up in the top left yeah uh yeah that's much better dyslexia friendly one I'm not sure those are look pretty similar but yeah oh yeah that's a much better font

cool cool cool cool well I take this away immediately so there you go yeah but it was like up in the top corner I don't I don't look at things I just click go as fast as possible you want to be prompted at the start of the game of like welcome adventurers like look I mean in order to like get your control scheme but maybe this is just a me problem like I don't see like things around the edges quarters of screens those are advertisement spaces I I've trained my eyes over years to never look at at the outside of of browsers that's the only look at the thing in the center and assume that it's just like that that box in the corner is probably filled with like made by devolver or whatever and it's I mean something I should avoid looking at well all right that's I guess it's a me problem yeah can we take a moment to I want to appreciate something I rarely appreciate no there's no time we have to get to our third game of the day no uh yes which is uh the way the narrative is unfolds I it I really liked it it's one of those things that you don't have to engage with at all if you don't want which I like by default if I just want to smash a or whatever that you know just go through it whatever I just want to get to the game totally fine but in this case like the the mystery of it the like the uncovering of why who are these characters and like how I I would I really really enjoyed is every time you encounter an enemy for the first time or an ally or anyone for the first time there's a little dialogue back and forth a little bit between these characters and you get to learn a little bit about that backstory you get to learn a little bit about like why they're there what their motivations are why do they want to attack you why do they want to be your friend and like um even even the enemies are just like you know this is my duty I I am sworn to do this and like this isn't why and like I like that a lot and I like the art of it a lot and um the thing that's nice about it too though is that it is pure lore you don't have to memorize it it's not important to know in order for you to play the game and it's short and sweet yeah there's never a quiz about that like where yeah oh yeah if you can only recall the the prior form of this one character then you can get no there's none of that crap yeah yeah I did get really confused uh like I will agree on those points uh and I think that uh I maybe went too deep on it because the first time I I placed a vampire Mansion down and I encountered a vampire for the first time it's like hello I am a vampire and I'm you know I have some role to play in this universe I'm like tell me more vampire man and then like I was I was like okay like okay so there's a vampire guy and is he like an NPC that I have to like make sure that like I have to fight him every time or something and like I I did like those uh and I think like oh so like Hades that style you were yeah if I encounter him I need to yeah yeah so I I think I read into that a little too deeply Because by the time that I got to like I think the first goblin camp that that spawns on the map and you encounter like a goblin and enemy for the first time uh they're just you're like your character is like why are you you know you're a goblin well you don't have to be so so mean and everything they're like no I Goblin I smash I'm like okay I get it now uh Pro tip everyone uh immediately Oblivion those Goblin camps that's gonna kill you every time just get rid of them right away yeah goblins are bad Bandits are bad yeah both of those you just you nuke those right away don't even think about it but also don't listen to us because we just ruined the your learning experience where you're doing but everyone knows who listens to this that they they really can't be listening to this without having to play these games spoiler alert yeah I feel like Loop hero is well okay so my biggest criticism here is the Intel Center and I it really bugged me that I had to like work put in like effort to unlock the thing that's like here's all of this like uh your encyclopedia in the game if that was maybe like one of the first unlock options I feel like I would be a lot less loss at the start than I was I put in 10 hours and I still haven't unlocked it right yeah so I was like okay why am I collecting sticks and like stones and all these other like bizarre resources like breaks and Bones uh but those necromancers words will never hurt me uh like why why bother and like and where the hell do I get those things from like what what of like this menagerie of cards which like there's there's act there's not that many cards in the game but like why should I bother playing this Forest card versus the swamp card like why like why should I play one versus the other like I know now that like okay I should play this one in order to fight enemies of this type to get a certain no you know I mean like you're absolutely right it is a big like question like oh what's doing what but like ultimately the only resource that matters is that exact one that you talked about with the orbit transformation everything else you kind of collect slowly or whatever but that's the only one that you're ever short of because engagements where you're fighting four plus dudes are rare unless you like make them happen because in theory if you're trying to stay alive you don't want to like the thing that you want to avoid the most is fighting more than one thing because fighting one thing you almost never lose HP fighting more than one you have to kill the one thing and then the second and then the third and the fourth and so because you're always fighting one thing at a time basic unless you're like Necromancer but but the point is that like it's yeah multiplication is how you die the closest I got to beating the second boss yesterday was uh like the boss had spawned I was like right about to do it and there was like ah there's a bunch of Bandits on this town I'll just nuke the town whatever and that then turned the fields around it into Blades of saws or whatever and there were four of them and us and a slime and they just insta killed me yeah and I was like yeah you gotta nuke the actual dudes and not the base I didn't realize that and then you're very frustrating because that was on like Loop 11 or something like I just really slowly wow yeah I was like it was the highest I had ever looped around I did a really really slow play and extremely strong character and then just got got absolutely wrecked like so fast like 10 seconds maybe it's like insta-kill uh which was disappointing because I wanted to go fight the boss and figure out if I could I wanted to see what what the boss how I ranked up against it like was I gonna finish I don't know probably that was a very negative item so I mean so here's the problem with the the problem with doing like this podcast is uh if we had if we stopped doing the podcast today probably but instead I'll play whatever our next game is and Squad uh and Rocket league so like like we're

uh I mean I'll probably play more of it but I don't know if I'll play it enough to to beat it I mean that's what 15 20 more hours I was at 27 I think yeah so that's like a lot of time this is how much of a nerd I am like you're one week of playing we're like say hey let's play a second game and then in one week I played 30 hour or you know 27 hours of this game that's how much time I have in my hands to do this kind of [ __ ] yeah I don't have enough time to do a halftime job and like I got Plan D and D and I gotta do other stuff and like Colin do you really need a job and sleep or do you want to grind out just one just one more Loop man I mean I did play like immediately from when I got home today until like four minutes before we got on the zoom call so I wanted to grind out one more Loop and I was like can I get a loop in before and I was like wait it's like no there's like six minutes before we start no I can't do another loop well I will say for for anyone who's like I know this doesn't apply to you guys because you guys are just so you know we're so busy oh my god well you're just so you know straight edge and whatnot but if you want to play a game wall high this is the game you play while high because I'll tell you what like yeah about eight nine o'clock if you're stoned and you turn this game on like it is the grindiness perfect level of Engagement does not really matter that much because you're you're just watching this thing play out and you're like you're making decisions on occasion but you're not like in the auto battler aspect of it I think any time you're making a decision I can pause yeah you can pause it and it's just like oh yeah this is it's the right pace for like being high and like about to go to bed and like in the last hour I can absolutely see that and so but by all means stretch this game out into that space of your life if you can because it's a very it's a very it does that very very well this I feel like this game really shines in like the 20 minute period or like even like 15 minute period of like hmm I've got I've got like a little bit of time to kill I'll do like you always say you're gonna do one lube and then you always do like two or three moves so go in with that expectation I feel like now when you say one Loop do you mean one one one run yeah yeah exactly I was like I hope you're doing more than one Loop in 15 minutes for the loops last like a minute hour they're like an hour or an hour and a half if you get like far enough but I guess you know skill difference you know so probably 20 minutes yeah but I mean if you're playing on turbo mode like all the pros do maximum turbo here uh yeah I feel like there's there's like a very good amount of satisfaction of like yeah okay I'm gonna boot up some Loop hero I'm just gonna do one Expedition uh and grind out some resources and see what kind of like fun party balloon rewards I get like oh what can I do with this stuff this time yeah I guess I'll unlock this thing that seems like fun um and yeah like I guess like the way that Will's kind of like hyping up the um the lower to it I do want to see more of like what like okay like there's some there's some uh interesting aspect about like letting go of the universe and like chaos and like trying to fight against that at least that's what I've gotten so far from the first boss and I'm curious to see what more boss stuff ties into that Ordo AB cow my friend ordoa you know order from chaos order from cows I order from cows exactly I have come to the lich's influence or Oro yeah you should all I think you should both finish the game in my opinion but uh but that's probably because I rated it in such a way that we're about to get into yeah uh yeah it's let's let's jump into our rankings each episode we we try as best as we can to rank the games that we just covered against the the pool of games that we've already covered uh I guess I'll go first um uh I'm gonna put Loop hero and streets of Rogue together uh just behind hand of Fate 2 and just ahead of Orson the realm of aslona as my new number six and number seven games I think like what streets of Rogue I think is is very fun for like certain specific mindsets and if you have the mindset of like okay we're gonna have like a bunch of friends over we're gonna have it's gonna be a pizza party we're gonna pick all zombies and we're gonna uh just like constant Mayhem Bam Bam Bam ticks all the boxes for that uh if you're in the mindset of like you know what I do want to try putting some cigarettes into this uh air conditioner and poison all the people inside uh and then that way I can like steal the mayor's hat and finally be elected zombie mayor that was a really great way to end it by the way I really like that when we did that but it's too bad it's too bad our landmine didn't go off but uh but yeah like certain like specific mindsets it it aces really well and I'm I'm very excited for when streets of Rogue two comes out I think this the we didn't I don't think we talk about it but the soundtrack for streets of Rogue really really bumping I really like it a lot uh and yeah I think it plays into the game very well I'm putting Loop hero just barely ahead of that because I think that like it just seems more like long-term engaging it it definitely seems like you know there's there's strategy in streets of Rogue it might not be super obvious but there is like a strategic element in that kind of metal gear solid five sandboxy zany sort of way Loop hero does seem more strategic in like a more straightforward manner of like okay I have I've got to like figure out how to do these cards and like carcassone style placement of the things around the map and like how do I make the enemies spawn over here and how do I balance that with life regen on the other side of the loop and all those things there's a lot of fun puzzles to uncover there uh I just wish the let's wish the Intel Center was not buried behind like five or six other layers of unlocks so that way I could understand more of like what exactly I'm unlocking and when I guess but both really good games uh I just think hand of Fate 2 maybe does the the um the reward mechanism uh stuff a little better and is a little less grindy than muguru I find it astounding that you put that ahead of Orson but you know what that's fine I know we agree I mean it's very controversial for you too most of my games you don't understand uh but go ahead uh right now right now worsen for me is below the 50th percentile yeah so uh

I mean once once uh warsim integrates chat GPT gpt4 Etc uh then then we're then we're smoking and we're uh no I'm not reading that I'm not reading that I'm just there for the betting and for the uh yeah but think about how much procedural generation could be if you were literally procedurally generating from an AI even weirder stuff too many breaks in that but yeah yeah we'll we'll see I'm I'm very I just don't like betting emergency games uh yeah that's a whole other thing but anyway uh I put streets of Rogue slightly lower um I feel like I have a higher uncertainty bar on this rating because I have not played anywhere near as much of it um I didn't play the single player version of it which I it seems like it's a different game um I found it to be a fun engaging multiplayer game and I'm rating it based solely on that aspect of it so if you have uh criticism or a rating too bad uh it was pretty fun it's a fun beat him up smash them run around hang out with your friends uh dessert uh I I feel like uh it was a while back now pineapple smash crew feel like the same kind of thing where it's just like you're running around just doing things and and shooting stuff and it's like I'm not I I personally was not thinking very hard I felt like I never really knew what was going on maybe because both of you guys have played it much more than me I was just like running around shooting things having a great time uh so I put it at number nine um and I put blue pair also uh same with Scott at number six out of what are we at 21 now so uh pretty high on the list uh I feel like it had a lot of things going for it um but in the end it just it was it straddled that line between being long-term engaging and grinding and I feel like it felt for me at least it felt just a little bit too far on the grindy rather than long-term engagement like I could feel the pull of that long-term engagement but uh maybe I'm just not good enough at it either until like summer it just felt like there was some random and I was like I don't know why I'm failing and I'm having a hard time figuring that out but I'm mostly having fun while I'm doing it so I like watching my man run around the loop and uh and find some stuff um and slowly get better and slowly add some more stuff and like get them resources and make the village grow but I feel like the game's in front of it just had a little bit more to do during the game like I I want I want to be able to do more things in Loop hero I feel like it's got a lot of good stuff but my inability to influence

the fate of my character during the loop is what keeps it from being like a really good game and he keeps it just as a as a pretty good game

fair enough um cool well uh I uh I'm a little different as has always been the case here especially with regards to these rankings in many ways I I have a wonderful one to ten ranking and um I'll put it in the context of the 21 it looks like games that we've rated so far but like one to ten I think is the easiest way to parse this and so uh streets of Rogue 6.5 uh six is my minimum threshold for recommendation which is to say I recommend this game like it's that oh the time that the three of us in particular played that one session where we're aping out or mostly aping out and like managed to beat the game and like we're discovering like how the game works as we're going through it and it's still like this like oh what happens when I do this oh you get hurt a lot and like you know it's just like oh there's a guy who just jumped out of a sewage like great and it just starts stabbing me okay like that's like fun there's a novelty to it um it does die very quickly that novelty and especially like we mentioned like that that whole repetitive nature of the level design um not so great and solo I played a lot more solo than these guys did because as has been discussed I mean have no life and I just like play video games for way too much time in general and um uh it it didn't didn't really have that much appeal to me I I tried lots of different classes I tried to understand like you know what you know I wanted to win but also like I wanted to have fun and it just wasn't as much fun so just 6.5 I mean it's fun especially if you're playing with friends if you're playing alone it's it's probably really good for a certain type of person that's not me I I mean like certain games are very good for certain people this one just was not my particular style Loop hero 7.5 better um in fact of the games we played that actually puts it in the number three ranking uh along with four other games will you need to differentiate your games better I'm sorry 7.5 just happens to be how I feel about I think you need to move to a hundred point scale Loop hero Binding of Isaac hand of Fate 2 and FTL um all of those games I still stand by Yep they're all 7.5s they are interchangeable in that they're almost 1.5 zeros on on the right I mean I could try and get a little bit more Fidelity around this stuff but I mean it doesn't really matter I mean like Loop hero or Binding of Isaac well I'm gonna be biased by presentism there's gonna be a whole bunch of effects to play into so I'm just gonna leave it as it is um and uh I'll just say that like yeah Loop hero I really enjoyed it's but and I think that probably me I rated this one a little higher than you guys did because I for this type of game getting stoned late at night uh really gets past maybe that grindy sort of thing where it's like yeah I could see that being I'm just gonna like just chilling out like in my bed computers Zone which um is a monitor over my bed I just get like as I'm falling asleep I get to like just basically like play video games I don't think I can think of a game that would be more improved by being high than this game it is the gameplay Loop is so perfectly matched with the kind of impairment that you get from being high right like you don't need to think about things all at once you can just focus on one little thing and you can pause it if you feel like you get distracted which you might by anything so I stand by those ratings and um obviously Will's ranks are the best ranks for anyone out there who's paying attention so um just keep that in mind this is true this is true well our uh our social plug segment of the uh the podcast if you want to write emails into uh uh send them to grantpan Zone at Grog podzone gmail.com is what it says uh our Mastodon should you so desires grogpod at gamedev dot place annunciations are important uh and if you want to see our uh rankings and uh previous episodes and data that we use to drive all the show and all that all that fun stuff grogpod dot Zone uh more websites need to be dot Zone domain uh this opportunity for most places but we'll what are we playing for our next game here well I looked at a few uh The Cult of the Lamb I looked at despots game and I looked at grifflands and they all looked really good um I mean it was a very difficult decision but because I couldn't say slay Aspire because I played so much of that I know everyone here had like I could force us all to like go through another playthrough but like I wanted something similar to it but wasn't the same and I know I'll be playing your hand too early right I mean like and also like I don't know are we ever gonna do this latest fire on this pocket I'm not sure it's just it feels like it's just been so dope yeah it is it is I think we are legally obligated to do

some point we're gonna have to do slay the spire and at some point we're gonna have to do Hades and monster train and like there's a bunch of other well we're definitely going to do Monster the next time it's my pick we're doing Monster trains okay that'll happen soon and we're gonna be covering muck and we're gonna be covering shigatory and we're going to be covering uh approaching Infinity all of the greats all of gay all games I've heard of

but Griff lands is one that like is very much his latest player-esque and it's not please buyer so I'm I'm very curious as someone who's currently developing a game which is licensed by her like to learn as many mechanics as I can um that are in this space and so this is the one that looks it's very highly rated and I'm excited to play through it looks like it's um very character focused and it's got some interesting animations and um yeah let's go well testing out a a new exit part of the podcast uh to play us out will be the soothing tones of missiles dropping from the sky drug hunting robots and pink goop facing this to the end of the podcast here [Music]
