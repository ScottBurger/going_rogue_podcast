Back so soon?
I knew you would not falter.
One more for the show.
Come, Sit.
You have passed the 13 episodes and you come to our podcast to listen to the game of life and death.
0:37
Your stake is wagered.
I refuse.
None who come here yet, I say turn back, the recording begins.
One lives and one dies.
Let us.
See what you are me.
Everyone's tuned off now.
0:56
Almost done with the the intro.
I am the dealer.
Of the Going Rd.
Gaming Podcast, Scott Berger Here are the members of my.
Court.
I'll try, man.
Why not?
I bet you'll be grateful for that.
1:12
Anyways, as you might even say to that, this is, this is a will.
I don't have any flavor text around that.
Just that's it.
That's me.
I am calling wielder of the mighty hammer, and I'm sorry.
1:28
And I'm Dolly, and I'm wondering what the other two of us are going to do if only one of us lives and the other one dies.
Do we just kind of phase out of existence doing?
Neither.
No, I think you get turned.
Well no, you don't get turned into a card in this game.
Think you just you you have to go through a 45 minute gauntlet in endless mode is what happens.
1:50
But but yes listeners, today we are talking the the game's hand of fate one and two.
And Bono's hands of fate, but only by accident.
I was, yeah.
I was going to skew people astray for a SEC by by saying yeah, the the games that we were playing were released in on November 15th, 1966 and directed by Harold P Warren.
2:14
But that Colin, that actually tricked you at first, didn't it?
When we said that we were going to play Hands of Hand of Fate, didn't you?
It did.
We're all playing from your Steam library, and I found it, and I was like Hands of Fate.
That must be the game we're playing.
It's from.
From the 90s based off the movie and it's very bad.
2:33
Don't play it.
The game you're looking for is Hand of Fate, singular and then Hand of Fate 2.
Which is singular but has a two at the end.
Yes.
A singular 2.
Collectively, they are the Hand of Fate games.
Can't put an S at the end of them.
Hand of Fate One released February 17th, 2015.
2:54
You can find it on Steam, GOG, PlayStation, I guess PS4, Xbox One, all the usual kind of heavy hitter consoles developed by Defiant Development, a game dev studio out of Brisbane, Australia.
Who worked on a couple other little indie games, but I think they're best known for their their Hand of Fate series.
3:15
I think they they wound up recently spinning off and joining another game dev studio to to release a new game coming out about the superheroes, which seems interesting.
Statute Hand of Fate One rolls in at our 74th most popular rogue leg.
3:32
In the Steam universe, in the Steam catalog, 10,266 total 10,268 total reviews.
Got to get the number right?
Obviously in the 98th percentile.
Dahlia as our special guest of honor for this episode.
3:51
What?
How?
How would you describe this game if you were given 4 cards that?
From from a hooded, mysterious figure that you had to shuffle around and form a a single sentence from.
It's probably temperance, the world the fool inverted.
4:14
And then the last one is the bicycle.
How to play poker?
No, but seriously, it is a game that is.
It it is a rogue, like in many ways by name only, but still has all of the the bits and bobs of a rogue.
4:33
Like very few of the systems you would expect are in there and yet it's got it's got them in different ways.
It's really just a fun little turn on all of the the tropes in just about every way and you can you can punch guys in the face with the with the hammer.
4:51
Yeah, we're pretty we're pretty loose with the the rogue, like.
It's just even a little bit rogue.
Like we're we're good with that.
Yeah, yeah, this this game is is interesting because I wanted to go through my Steam purchase history and figure out what what sort of prompted me at the time to seek this game out because Hand of Fate won.
5:15
Like we said, kind of released a while back, but I wound up looking and like seeing at my Steam library somewhere around like 20.
Or let's see, the first achievement I had was in like 2019.
So I'm like, OK, scroll, scroll, scroll, account details.
What other games did I buy around that time to kind of like inform my play style?
5:35
And I couldn't find it.
I know it might have been.
Part of like a Humble Bundle or something?
It's either that or the game is haunted and just self inserted itself into my Steam library, which seems equally plausible.
You're just like shaking your computer and a card fell out.
5:54
But yeah, Hand of Fate.
Hand of Fate One, I guess maybe we'll we'll focus our discussion on You are greeted by a hooded, cloaked figure who greets you to your to your rogue like podcast and you are presented with a story mode and I think you have to unlock endless mode after a little bit.
6:13
Is that right?
Yeah, for both of them.
Yeah, and Story mode this is.
We've we've covered some deck building card games in the past.
This is very much a a card card game, in that almost basically everything in this game is cards, except for unexpectedly 3D battle sequences.
6:38
Yes, it is a.
It is a card battler where you don't play with the cards.
Right.
That's the first.
That's the first twist on the formula.
The the hooded, chatty narrator of the game opens up what what can I only be described as?
6:57
Kind of like a Pokémon style card collecting thing that I have in my basement downstairs, and presents you with a a series of challenges that you must go through in order to eventually figure out.
Figure out what the secret behind this game of life and death is.
7:14
Which I guess spoiler alert is is fighting the dealer himself at the end.
But but generally this game has you go through a series of three different encounters and then you complete those and you you fight some some little boss guy and you get an unlockable bit that will help with your meta progression throughout the game.
7:40
Yeah, you.
They're it's somewhat linear.
The cards for some of them, I'm assuming, especially later in the game you get a little bit more choice, but you are, you're hunting for the stairs and you work your way down and then I don't know what happened at the end, I didn't play that far the 1st.
7:57
One, maybe we should back up and describe how how the the game play space is sort of set up so you you're sitting across a table from the dealer very.
Very tarot card and inspired medieval roads near Eastern kind of aesthetic.
8:19
But what's interesting to me about this game is that instead of other kind of roguelike games where you have, you know, your character going from like room to room, the cards are the rooms in this sense.
Yeah, they they're like laid out in a pattern generally and you have to go from.
8:39
Wherever you start through the cards to wherever the stairs or the gate or whatever it is in that particular level is, and the cards that you have in your encounters deck are the ones that you can encounter as well as the bullshit ones that the dealer decided to throw in for the scenario.
8:55
Yeah.
I didn't think it was interesting that.
So finish first to go going through.
Yeah you you're, you're.
You're working your way through the cards, your little play figurine is going on and card flips over and then something happens.
Either it's either you know you make a choice and or you take a chance and you think the dealer shuffles 4 cards together and maybe some of them are successes or failures and that's just kind of a a random chance thing.
9:25
Or you get into an encounter where you Pokémon battle style into the into the 3D World where you're actually.
You know, I got out my controller and used the controller to fight things because it's a over the shoulder mini combat thing against, I don't know, three to six enemies.
9:46
You.
Can beat them up.
Yeah, it's very What is it like the the Batman Arkham style?
Punch them and and counter them and dodge them and stun them.
Kind of are your four buttons?
Yeah.
10:03
It's probably worth pointing out that in a typical, I guess, run of this game, you have a level cards laid out that you go from card to card.
Your little Monopoly man hops from one to the other, but you have to.
10:20
You got to juggle resources too along the way each.
I think in this one in hand to fate one, every time you move from card to card you consume one food.
Is that?
Right.
Yeah, I believe that's correct.
It's spoiler for Hand to Fate Two.
10:36
I played more of that to refresh myself for this than I did Hand to Fate One.
Yeah, and.
And I can see why.
Because hand to Fate Two, you don't consume food on things that you've already already discovered.
Or I think that's true for most of them.
Is that right?
Anyway, Hand of Fate one kind of laying out the formula for what?
10:54
For what will be perfected in the sequel.
But you know, you have health, you have food, and you have gold.
Pretty, pretty obvious.
You use gold to buy stuff, food to eat and regenerate your health.
11:10
But in some cases, you actually can use food as a currency, Like if you come across a card encounter that's like.
The helpful priest.
Hello, Sir, can I steal 25 food from you in order for maybe a blessing question mark and you're like.
Why don't you feed the children?
11:26
Yeah, yeah, the the guilt trip of the OR.
I guess the children will starve again this winter.
Be like, look, I have three food.
I'm going to starve to death.
I just need to get to the exit.
I'm trying to.
Yeah, the children will starve if the the anarchist.
11:42
Fire thrower burns down all the field too.
So yeah, so me, the the, the earner, the job creator of this I was.
Waiting for Job Creator to come out.
It was on my bingo card.
But yeah, like, like we kind of mentioned, there's there's encountered decks, there's equipment decks, there's there's there's lots of deck systems in this game and lots of cards have what look like little stamps on them or little, little tokens.
12:12
Where you know we we kind of mentioned the the helpful priest but you know you you come across some encounters that are like oh little story beep text text text would you like to save the Princess or or help what's what's one of them.
12:29
It's like there's there's two lovers that are like fleeing from their strict father or something you got to help them and then you're presented with the.
Like well how much do you want to help him?
A little bit or a lot?
Well lots going to cost you but that will help your odds.
12:45
With the I think in hand of Fate one the only kind of chance mechanic that you have is the the card shuffling.
Is that right?
I.
Remember that being at the case?
Yeah cuz I remember when I first did a dice spoiler for Hand of it too.
There's dice in it.
13:02
I was like what the fuck is this?
The dice in the metronome thing that they introduced in the second one.
To give it more variety because otherwise it is just watching the same car shuffle animation over and over and over again.
But I tell you what I almost, I'm not sure.
13:17
I think I prefer FTLI think like it's the same same game structure around like here's the scenario, we're not going to actually present you with the odds because we're assholes and we don't actually want you to know what's going to happen.
And then you make a decision and then it's like, OK and now here you get to see the odds.
So there's kind of like an intermediate step where it's like, oh, now I know I have a one in.
13:34
More chance of having success and then like a one in four chance of like really bad failure and the rest are failure or something like that.
It's like is that better or worse than just seeing like chance of success X amount?
I don't know, I like I've complained.
I want to know what my probability of success is before choosing the option.
13:50
I think that's just a modern game play, good decision.
But I agree by the way, a pro tip for that card shuffle game.
Look for the look for the cards that you want the most and just just.
Just see if that is the one that winds up going on to the top.
14:07
Now you only have to take between three cards.
Yeah, that's a real Monty Hall problem solution for the real world.
Half of this game, half of the game, it's.
Actually physically shuffling them.
It is, yeah.
Yep, if there's one.
That will wind up on top.
14:24
My choosing strategy was.
Always the one that it just puts you on.
So always left because it doesn't matter.
No, I'm following it with my eyes.
It was all my my voodoo strategy was always pick the worst one because that way you know that's.
Yeah, you watch the worst one, and if that one's the one that goes on top, you know exactly which one not to pick.
14:43
I did the exact same thing and some of the ones where there's like a great success one, I'd watch that one and really, really risk it for the biscuit.
But but yeah, it's.
Literally.
The Mont Y'all problem.
I literally did not know that you could.
That I I assumed that it was 100% random and there was no information.
15:00
Actually, I had no idea.
Yeah.
Yeah, there there have been.
When I when I got this game ages ago, I think I must have spent way too much time.
Focusing on like those card shuffling things like like you know you're you're putting a ball under the solo cups and you're like listening for it to like roll around like OK, it's definitely under that one, like the cards.
15:21
And like you can kind of discern this too from like the card shuffling speed.
So like there's there's some encounters that are like like borderline impossible and your hope of completing it is basically zero and the cards will shuffle like.
15:38
Instantaneously fast and for all intents and purposes like yeah, that that one's random.
But for like the really easy ones like right at the start like welcome to Hand of Fate here, here's your hand of cards.
Now to start your fate, the cards will like very slowly shuffle and if you watch one you can kind of like ones on the on the edge will have like a higher speed to them.
16:00
And like as they shuffle back out, like they maintain that kind of momentum.
So you can sort of watch like okay the one on the end is like shuffling like into the pile very fast and then when it reshuffles you can kind of figure out like where it went from.
I was.
Probably try like clicking X as fast as I can, hoping that I could skip the shuffle.
16:20
Me too.
I mean, that's my biggest complaint with both of these games is there is a lot of.
It you shuffle a lot of times and it takes, I mean it, not that long, a couple of seconds, 5 seconds.
But I'm like, I do not care as fast, like just and like.
16:41
There's a lot of flavor text too that's just barely like.
Maybe this is important, probably not.
But yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of like or like.
The intro to the battle is very slow.
16:56
It's a little bit better in in the second one.
But the first one, there's a lot of like, it's cool the first time.
All the goblins and see them do their moves.
Yeah, like, I guess I haven't explored.
Maybe there's a setting to be like turn off all of that.
I don't want any transition animations.
17:14
No, I'm sorry, there's not.
Yeah, I mean, it's a small complaint, but.
It is annoying.
I think it's a valid one though, because yeah, it's not that much time in the grand scheme of things, but also that time it adds nothing to it, so why have it?
17:29
Yeah, they're like you're going into the card and there's like a swirling portal thing.
It's like, yeah, I guess if we were in 1999 and you were using that time to load the scenario, sure, like if you're if it's, it has a purpose.
17:45
But I'm pretty sure, like what Hannah Fake Two came out and.
What 20?
17 I think. 2017 November 7th 2017 Yes.
Yeah, we pretty much got rid of loading animations by that time, which you could load it in the background while you're clicking on other stuff.
18:03
Right.
Yeah, it almost seems like this game needs a or.
Like one or both of these games needs a.
Hey, it's. 2023, as it was recording and we all have NVMESSD's are on our motherboard.
18:19
So just have the dealer go click and then jump right into combat and then click, you're jumped out.
But yeah, I think like despite the there, like there's a lot of things with hand to fate, one that kind of haven't really aged super well from a gameplay perspective, but.
18:36
I kind of still had a lot of fun jumping back into this.
I was like, okay like, let's see, let's pick up where I left off.
And I think I'd just beaten like the Lizard King at that point.
I'm like, okay.
Well, I'll play through this grouping of scenarios just to get my bearings.
Remember what the hell was going on?
18:54
And yeah, like I was picking up the muscle memory and I'm like, okay like.
This is, this is like the deck that I had been building at the time and like this is roughly where I was with like some of these like meta progression tokens and and things like that.
I'm like, OK, like this is I'm all starting to get back into this lost to the Lizard King like two or three times.
19:15
I'm like, OK, let's maybe turn it down to easy mode and see what happens.
So had all three of you played Hannah Fate 2?
This was this was my first time jumping into hand of Fate Two, actually.
19:31
OK, so you would only played Hand of Fate one at dollar.
You would played both then I'm assuming and Will you only played two?
Yeah, 30 hours.
OK, so I was the and I was the only one that came in completely obviously blind because I played the wrong game before I played the right game.
19:50
So I didn't play that much of Hand of Fate one, because I was.
Planning on playing more of Hand Fate Two, and I heard will say it, it's not as good.
So I played.
Having played like an hour of Hand of Fate One and then directly in A Hand of Fate Two, it feels like Hand of Fate One is one of the most directly like.
20:16
This is the first game in the series and then they greatly expanded and bettered it for the second game.
Like it is not a sequel.
In the like, we're just picking up where the story left off.
It is the first game was a demo of the the idea and the second game was the the the full execution of the the promise that was foretold in hand of Fate One.
20:42
The dealer had a secret card behind his back and it was if we make enough money off this first game, we'll make the good game for real.
This time I so I didn't.
I didn't get far enough in the hand of Fate One to judge it really on its own merit.
I thought it was like a fine game that even in the hour of playing was like, OK, I'm having fun, but this is starting to be similar and I could see it getting a little bit samy over the time, which is.
21:11
I mean exactly what they tried to solve in the second one, so.
Yep, yeah, let's maybe let's maybe jump into Hand of Fate Two a little bit.
So the stat sheet for that one we said released almost two years later, November 7th, 2017.
21:26
Same devs.
Ironically, Hand of Fate two.
Hand of Fate One was #74.
Hand of Fate #2 is #132 on the popularity list of Unseen with only 5295 reviews.
Cranking in at only the 96.79 percentile.
21:45
But yeah, like I was, I was a kind of surprised to see that the the objectively better game seemingly less popular.
But I don't know if that's like part of part of that bit of like just like review bias over time.
Like who?
The shiny new thing when it's first released, like gets all the reviews and then like the sequel comes out and then you know.
22:05
The review universe is kind of diluted out to some degree and people are like, Oh yeah, I remember Hand to Fate.
That was a good game.
Maybe I'll review it and I don't forget.
Or could just be like the people who would have liked Hand to Fate 2 but didn't like Hand to Fate.
One was like, well, I'm not going to try that.
22:22
So anyone who was on the fence but chose not to, you know itself, weeded out the people who would probably have liked the second game more.
Yeah, I think I will.
There's one thing about.
Hand of Fate One that this might be a spicy tag.
22:38
I can't wait.
I think the soundtrack in Hand of Fate One is better than Hand of Fate 2.
You would notice that.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be real with you, Scott.
There's two things I do when I turn on a game There, there go to the settings and turn off motion blur and then they are turn the music all the way down.
22:56
I am not here.
I'm not here to listen to video game music.
I had.
I had.
Finally someone.
Finally, someone who live, who who lives the will life.
Scott, Scott and I talking about like, oh, that was a good soundtrack.
Like, oh, I don't know about it.
It was just like, I didn't.
23:13
No, I'm.
I'm sorry.
I played a lot of DDR in high school.
All of the music from video games that I've ever needed to listen to got crammed into that for years or so.
So now I can listen to real music or whatever.
Terrible, like.
Procedural cop show I'm watching on the other monitor while I'm playing.
23:31
That's that's gonna engage me way more than than the music.
I'm with Will on this one.
I mean, well part of it is that like every every podcast episode I try to end with like some sort of like cool music clip from from the game to be like this is what the thing was.
23:47
So I was like going through in the the.
Music artists for this game, Jeff Van Dyke DYCKI Pronounce it can't Go one episode without me mispronouncing at least one thing.
But he did the soundtrack to Rome Total War definite.
24:06
Stay tuned.
Paint the town red.
Another kind of like.
If Minecraft was developed by murderous sociopaths, Android Assault Cactus kind of a fun game, and weirdly, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.
And like all of these, just, like, absolutely slack.
24:23
Classic classic soundtrack I.
Actually think that that I might remember that that music from the the PGA Tour games is weirdly good so.
Yeah, but I was going through and I was like listening to his YouTube playlist.
24:39
And I'm like, Okay.
Yeah, Hannah.
Fate One, yeah.
This is all the stuff that I remember from like, you know, the almost 20 hours that I put into the first game.
Like, yeah, this.
And and like, there's a lot of stuff from the game that kind of like, you don't get to hear like the full music piece, almost kind of to the detriment.
24:56
So if if anyone is, you know, the two video game music geeks listening to this 100%, go check out Jeff Van Dyke's YouTube channel and boot up that Hand of Fate one.
Playlist and definitely not in the Hand of Faith 2.
Playlist is.
Santa Fe 2 Music bad.
25:13
No, it's not bad.
But when I was going through, I was like, I was thumbs upping the ones I'm like, OK, yeah, I'll thumbs up.
This one is safe later and come back to for podcast editing.
Ooh, that one's another good one.
Thumbs up.
Ooh, this one's really good too.
Thumbs up.
Come to the hand of Faith 2 playlist.
I'm just like, yeah, I mean, it's good, but.
25:31
I'll tell you that I I was playing hand to faith two like an hour ago and I cannot.
Summon into my brain the music.
So I have no memory of music playing.
So it obviously wasn't like good enough to have done the earworm thing, which happens on on worse games and worse music.
25:53
But it's like, I'm sure it's like good and appropriate, but it's not catchy, so it doesn't drive itself into your brain.
So you hear it again and again later.
Not the Doom Eternal soundtrack, is what you're saying.
There are no heavy metal guitars in it as far as I can remember.
26:11
Can we get to the core of the matter here?
I think what's on everyone's minds?
What stringed instrument was playing in the hand of Fate One soundtrack?
Yes, I think we definitely should get to that.
I think it's Amanda Lynn.
Question mark.
What's the question, Will?
26:28
The question is this this game.
It seems to be the answer to the question.
How much bullshit can you put around a very simple combat experience And the and the difference between 1:00 and 2:00 is dramatic in the sense that like the answer if you just have cards slipping over over and like flavor text and like this thing is happening what will you do?
26:50
One in four chance of winning this thing is happening.
Like that gets boring immediately.
The second time they're like okay fine let's we're going to introduce dice.
We're going to introduce ways of modifying the dice.
We're going to introduce a metronome thing so it's a timing sort of like thing we're going to introduce a wheel that's.
Spins around and so blessings, curses, relatives, right, Right.
27:07
You got.
Fame.
Now to ways to like pull things out of your deck.
Right.
And it's all is like a just padding around like essentially making sure that you win in those combat scenarios.
And like that's and I think that's all well and good but I think it's interesting because it's like the most it's like a the the on the extreme side of like taking a normal game.
27:27
Like if you think of like a as a normal as if like this is a norm but like think about a Zelda sort of game like a Breath of the Wild.
Like it's a very continuous experience.
It's like almost the extreme of continuity where you are running from place to place and like things are happening and but this game is like Nope, you are in a scenario and then it's just the text of what's happening outside that scenario so you're not going into the the next town.
27:49
To talk to the person, to save the chicken, to do what it's just like, Yep, that's just a text.
And so it's just very interesting way of breaking it up.
And in my opinion, it seems lazy.
But it's novel.
It's a novel, but it is lazy.
It is the anime of video games.
28:07
That's my hot take.
Here, well are we are we talking One Punch Man anime or are we talking?
And the screen is wrote is like panning over the one frame while they concentrate at each other for 30 seconds.
You know, talking in their heads about how they were going to destroy their enemy.
That's that's what it feels like a little bit.
28:23
It is interesting though, because like it's a.
It's a good point of fundamentally the the absolute core of the game is the.
Warp your way into a small battle arena, you against a couple of other things, people, monsters, etcetera.
28:45
And turns out if you add enough stuff around it that that is that it stops being like a difference in it.
It starts being a difference in kind, like it feels like the same mechanics but a different game because you have so many ways to modify it and so many other things that you're like.
29:05
Doing and interacting with you're changing weapons because they deal different kinds of damage to different like oh, swords deal with Northman better.
So you like got to switch to that for this thing.
Like I feel like it it it it does become a different experience.
29:25
Yeah, I feel like the that that statement applies more to hand a Fate one than it does to Hand a Fate two.
I think because.
Like, yeah, Hand of Fate One is just like a very rudimentary Batman Arkham combat game with like some like, interesting deck builder stuff kind of kind of around it, but maybe a little disjointed.
29:47
Hand of Fate Two, I think, yeah, there's more stuff, but there's there's some like indescribable, like quintessential element that like, makes it greater than the sum of its parts.
And maybe that's just me, like.
Like trying to dig out of this like 20 hour hole that I put into the first game, but like it, it feels like there's no other, there's no other like deck building game that feels like this kind of with like these kind of approaches or even like the process by which you go through.
30:21
And, like, meta progress.
So you're like, oh man, I'm getting really stuck on this, this one quest in Hand of Fate.
Two, if only I was able to get some better equipment.
Well, like, I have some of these encounters that have, like, these tokens that I haven't unlocked yet.
30:37
Maybe I should go and try to like, pick some more gnomes.
Maybe that'll unlock the thing and then you unlock the thing like, oh, like I got a cool sword out of that.
Maybe I can use that to to advance a little bit or.
Like you'll get like either equipment or like more encounter types and you can tune your you know, you can like customize your deck to put in the like a bullshit like heel style deck.
31:00
Like OK this thing is like totally overloaded with stuff to heal me or give me food so that way I won't be like totally kicked to the curb with the the BS meter the next time I play through.
I don't know how much the the recommended decks involve.
Like the Bullshit or Rama, but it does seem like you can deck build your way out of that to some degree.
31:21
How many, So when you guys were playing, how how many times did you go back and replay old?
So like in the second one, there's a bunch of distinct like mini campaign there.
31:37
So there's the larger.
Scenario.
And then, yeah, there's the scenario.
So it's like, OK, you go through the scenario and do a thing.
I didn't really go, I I didn't play for long enough to go back and do redo very many of them.
But I'm assuming that if you're playing at either heart of difficulties or just longer into the game, you end up going back and redoing some of those just to to to do the tokens on cards and just like grind your way through stuff and like OK.
32:05
Yeah, there's definitely some scenarios that are ideal for.
Crocking the things you need to unlock the tokens and and do all of that.
There's a couple that that just really makes that a lot easier depending on what they do.
If we're comparing it to something like FTL would be like I don't care about winning on this run.
32:23
This is the run to just like unlock the crystal Gollum ship or whatever yes or the the error sucking ones.
You just like OK, I don't care about any of this, I just want to make sure that I get a gazillion fame so I can unlock the Super ice weapon or whatever.
32:40
Exactly.
And and for me, that was the game.
Like I I think all I have left in hand of Fate Two is the last in the second to last scenario.
And I I did all of those basically with just the starting hammer and the rest of the time was me.
33:00
Going back and unlocking literally every little piece of garbage that I could, because that's the game for me, is filling out that codex.
It's getting, It's collecting them all.
It's it's the Pokémon analogy.
You got to catch all those tokens and all the cards.
Got to help the little boy find his family, got to help the guy find, get good at thieving.
33:20
You got to both save and damn the the town.
There is something stupidly addicting about.
The encounter card comes up and the little token peels off and it's floating in the dealer's hand.
He's like, are you gonna solve it?
Are you gonna solve it?
Are you gonna do it?
33:35
You got it.
You gonna pull that that mega fail card out of the the four options.
And I'm just like, sitting there watching this, like, jeweled piece of candy dance around in front of my face like.
OK, I'm going to give the little this, the begging children all of my gold again this time.
33:52
Or I'm going to give the gnome this other weapon because I got to get that stupid token and then oh, like the oh this this weapon's too big for the gnome.
What am I going to do with this?
And then the dealer put, you know, takes the the token back.
Like, no.
The the flip side of that that token is when you find the the car that's like the vampire guy who's just like sucking your blood and it's just like.
34:16
Do you give him a little more blood?
You want to give him a little more blood.
You want to give him a little more blood.
And I kept he's like let him keep sucking your blood because I thought eventually like a cool event would proc it doesn't.
He just drains all of your health and then if you could do it just one single time you get the same event.
34:33
And the first time I I had a temporary blessing that like.
Full healed me.
When I got down to 25 health and I probably I drained over 100% of my life my my Max life, crying I was like, I got to get it.
I've already invested too much.
Now there's got to be like something where you give him enough blood.
34:51
He's like now I'm Satan.
Here's your your very special blood dagger.
But no he never gives you the blood dagger.
He never does.
I don't remember if in hand of Fate Two, I don't know that I've gotten far enough to to encounter this yet.
35:07
I'm sure it's in here.
Hand of Fate won A pretty common encounter that that you encounter with is is a trapped dungeon, a trap labyrinth are those in the second one.
35:23
It doesn't seem like they are as frequent in at least like the few hours that I've played of the first few campaign levels, I think.
There's a like one card with a Trap Dungeon encounter in it.
That you can get like that's all I remember is that there's one of them.
35:40
Yeah.
Yeah.
The one thing I really did appreciate from the second one, I was gonna head to the first.
So the first is pretty, it's a pretty straightforward, you know, maybe there's a couple different ways you could go to get to the like stairs at the end of the level, but there's like 6 cards and you go, you do whatever to get there versus the second one starts really.
36:02
That like the scenarios use the cards in different and interesting way.
So I just played through the one where you know rather than you know go through this thing and find the stairs.
It's like here's like 40 cards just laid out on the table.
Go chase down the relics that are like hopping around and it's it's the same game but they use the cards in such a different way that it it it's like a very different.
36:28
Feel and you kind of know it gives you a lot of things where it reveals stuff.
So you're like you have to plan out like, oh, I need to go to this one first so that I can get the fame, so I can go to the other one and it and it's it's it's got a lot of different little mini games in it that help keep it fresh as you're going through.
36:50
I like that.
Yeah, I think we did.
We touch on companions in hand to Fate 2 yet.
Only obliquely.
And how, like extremely irritating the the one guy who keeps getting captured is, and you have to make sure that he doesn't get his ass beat when he's handing over all of his gold to thieves in the market.
37:17
Yeah, I think like the among many of the improvements that Hand of Faith Two does over 1 graphically looks much better, I think.
Handifete one, I don't think look bad per se, but I think it's just every everything is just better polished in Handifete 2.
37:35
But we kind of touched on this with the the food.
Like for each kind of card that you walk on you can camp.
I think in most scenarios where because with your retrying old cards that you passed on, you're not consuming that food, it at least gives you the option of saying okay, you know do you want to like camp on this card here and like.
37:57
Prayed with someone or like eat a food and regenerate your health.
I appreciated that a lot with some with some campaign things I was going through.
I'm like, oh, I'm kind of dying here, but I need to camp in order to to refill my health a little bit.
But there is, I think, like almost almost every campaign again, like the few that I've played in the early game so far in Handifake 2 seems to give you like a different kind of campaign or a companion option.
38:29
Which do very interesting stuff.
One thing that really frustrated me about Hannah Fate One was like if you were fighting like a a big mob of dudes and it's like you versus like literally 40 skeleton Archers.
Kind of annoying, but if you have a big burly Northman guy who can just like fury, charge through them and stun like half of them.
38:53
But but I think that's a smart idea.
No, I'm that guy.
I'm Wheeling.
I'm wielding the big hammer and I'm swinging because I'm not good at Shields.
I'm just rolling and swinging hammers of things.
I felt like I was very bad at the Paramechanic.
39:10
It doesn't feel like it should be hard, but I just.
I just couldn't do it.
I just dodged instead.
I don't remember if this was me flipping the easy mode in Hannafay One, but it feels like the combat in Hannafay 2 is much harder.
Like in terms of.
Timing, where we've kind of said it was like a Batman game, but for those who haven't played, it's like, you know, you basically just like button mash.
39:31
But every so often, like an enemy that's about to attack, you will have a prompt above their head for like green hit the Y button and you can counter them and you block and then you repost and attack them or they're going to do something and you can like shield bash them to interrupt or various various things like that.
39:47
But it felt like the timings for those were much tighter.
In hand if a two then in one it felt like it was much like a much bigger window where it was almost getting bored in the first one of like OK yeah counter counter.
Yeah, you can just basically hit it whenever you feel like it.
40:03
Yeah, I guess we'll counter him.
And if I do, you actually have to do it at the right time or they'll just hit you.
It's almost like a rhythm game.
Yeah, actually, yeah.
And I my rhythm was dodging and not countering, but it did feel like, like, OK.
40:20
Trying to roll away and get like pick up the one at the edges so you're not surrounded by all the guys and you're not being hit by things you can't see.
That's really how they get you.
Is the like 5 thieves with fast knives stabbing you in the back.
That's what got me.
40:38
I don't.
I don't remember.
I mean, I know I beat the game Hanna Fate too.
But like I I went back and I only played a few of the.
The actual combats.
And so, yeah, I mean the combat itself, it did like, it kind of felt like what you're talking about much faster.
I really did notice that big difference in the Perry time too.
40:55
And like, I don't know, I don't know what the complexity looks like anymore though.
I can't.
Fall is there is what's the what's the compelling case for doing the endless mode Because for me I feel like Hand of Fate won the endless mode was helpful for like.
41:14
I'm getting stuck on like the main kind of story thing.
And yeah, I kind of don't want to, like, fight the same lizard man over and over and over again.
Just give me just throw it all in there in one big bucket and see what happens.
Has anyone else experimented with Endless mode to a deep degree?
41:32
I haven't even touched it at all.
I don't even know what it does.
And you unlock things for the in the campaign mode for the from the endless mode.
I believe so, cuz I think the endless mode was the first time in hand to fade one and I actually encountered like some of these training cards where I'm like how how have I never seen these before?
41:51
But I guess like because of like the deck tuning thing that I've been going through.
It's like, well, I'm not going to put these things in here because they're just like welcome to the game tutorial things, but in but in endless mode, like unless you've unlocked it or like it, it's like everything is in there and it's, it's a good way I think to meta progress in a way.
42:14
We're just like, yeah, you know, I have 20 minutes before my bus comes up to the stop.
I'll just jump in and see what happens and no expectations, I'll just let the game wash over me.
And there's there's some that can be a good way to like get some unlocks that you either forgot existed or or like, revisit stuff that was interesting like, you know, you boot up endless mode in like the next card that you encounter is like a cracking boss fight.
42:42
You're like, oh shit, like I forgot this thing was in here.
This is kind of a dope encounter.
Maybe takes a little too long but this was kind of fun.
And then oh, my boss is here, quit the game.
I'm imagining it's probably similar for Hand of Fate 2, but it seemed like there were there were cards that were specific to Endless Mode in Hand of Fate Two that I was unlocking.
43:04
Yeah, there definitely are.
I I unlocked some of them is like now you can.
The goblins are making trouble in endless mode.
So I'm assuming that's something you you you never encounter them in the base game.
You have to go to endless mode.
Maybe you get special unlocks from doing that but.
43:21
Are there there's more ranged weapons in Handifait 2?
Right?
Am I crazy?
I think so, yeah.
OK, because there's there's at least like 4.
Different ones, yeah.
I seem to recall one of the encounter, one of the early campaign things like you get, you get some hand grenades.
43:38
I'm like, OK, now we're talking Handifait one.
I don't recall ever getting like any sort of range stuff ever and having to deal with like.
Armored lizard men that are like acid spitballing you from across the map kind of kind of bullshit from time to time, but that first time that you get some sort of like, blessed antiskeleton grenade?
44:02
The whole hand grenade of Antioch.
Yes, that's the one.
And you just bowling ball down 8 skeletons at at once and you complete the encounter in like 1/4 of a second.
Pretty.
Good.
Highly recommend.
Well, yeah, I think Hand Fate Two, I've only gotten through one 2-3, maybe like four or five of of the campaign scenarios, but there's like there's like 20 plus of them.
44:28
I think like all things.
Hanna Fate Two has, you know, really kind of delivered with more like better and more polished and you can kick gnomes, which which isn't a thumbs up in my book.
44:45
No, I didn't like the no kicking.
I found it to be annoying.
I mean, it was.
Funny.
It was funny the first time, but the second time I'm like, God, get off of me.
Jump on you and stab you.
And then you have to kick them.
45:03
And then you try and give them stuff and you don't have the right things and they'll give you the good stuff.
And I wasn't able to get the token that's the real, you know, there we go.
That's it.
That's why I'm angry, because I didn't get the token from them, because you didn't have the right thing to give them.
Just gotta grind those gnomes and get that little candy token.
45:19
Yeah, literally grind them into Gnome Paste Do.
We wanna do.
We wanna move on to rankings next.
Feel like I had one.
What else?
I thought the.
45:37
Art was fairly good for the cards.
I liked the way that they had the art on the cards.
But I will say that I didn't.
I was not particularly a huge fan of the style look of of the actual like combat game.
45:54
It felt very like Fable Ask, which I mean that's it's it's a little bit of a of a nitpick in terms of it.
It didn't.
It was no detriment, and I'm glad.
It was like I'd rather play a stylized game from 2017 than a game from 2017 that's trying and failing to look good, but it's a little more cartoony than I would prefer.
46:25
But you got the cards which are the abstraction of reality, and then reality is the juxtaposition with that to give it.
I mean, like, otherwise it's like you're playing a cartoon.
And another abstraction of reality.
So I don't know, maybe I see what you.
I see what you're talking about though.
And.
I I didn't like the way my dude looked.
46:41
I mean, I just decided I I decided to vote on the the most late, the latest game that we're choosing on the basis of I don't want to play as these really cartoony characters I just don't like.
That stuff, Well, also like Hand of Fate one like you can't, you can't customize your character, you are like a mohawky.
47:01
Like, I mean, like you're you're kind of stylized to some degree, but like you know, there's no real creative user agency of like, oh, I want, I want my my hero to have like a big white beard and like like ridiculous proportions or something like that.
47:19
You're just like your standard kind of Mohawk, big grizzled adventurer.
But at least can FA2.
I think, you know you have those sort of player customization options.
And you're right that like the I like the aesthetic and like the art direction of of like the environments.
47:38
But you're right that like the the so there's something about the character models that seems incongruous with like the the tarot like mysterious element of the the card.
Design.
And or just with the dealer himself?
47:53
The dealer is so detailed and realistic, if you guys were standing next to each other, he'd be like, what the hell is that?
For yeah, the dealer's realistic.
The cards are like tarot type stylized like it's it's definitely like artistic and it's like pretty like like simple colors and then the.
48:15
I mean, it's not quite like.
League of Legends style.
But it's that.
It's moving there, though.
It's it's going from Borderlands to League of Legends, and it's somewhere in the middle.
Right, exactly.
So it's it's a it's a style as it I I'm always hesitant to criticize.
48:34
Things being stylized as opposed to just being super realistic, because I think that's the way that video games are moving now in 2023.
And I think that's a it's a good choice.
Like bad realistic stuff.
Like the The problem with realism is that the closer you get to realism, the easier just to notice where it's not real.
48:50
Like, oh, this game looks so great except for the water's terrible.
It's like it was water would have been.
Would have literally blown my mind in 2010 like I believed it was possible.
Or just like fashion going out of style, like something that was like set in the modern age in like 2004 and you're like, Oh my God, that was that was like people were wearing shirts like that back then.
49:10
Jesus.
Right.
It's just like the Matrix coat, but it's supposed to, like, actually be wearing it for real.
This will never go out of style, Trinity.
Let me ask.
Let me ask one one final another question I should say.
Did you guys like the narrator and and like, did you feel differently about the narrator between 1:00 and 2:00?
49:29
I kind of like Dealer in this game in both of these games.
I was constantly surprised by the the the narrator, like chiming in to say like meaningful nonsense based on what was happening.
I like the the amount of times they said something.
49:45
I was like they programmed that in here and to be that specific about this specific situation.
I liked the narrator.
I I I feel like.
I'm not hugely into flavor text, and I feel like his he had a good voice, and I feel like that was just enough to make it so, like the flavor text was not boring.
50:06
And I'm like, I'm willing to listen to you say this because it's short.
It's just long enough that I'm not trying to skip through it and I can't skip through it because it's too short to skip through, but.
50:24
Yeah, I mean, I liked him.
I mean, I I tend to agree more with two than one, but I it's just from having played one here for the first time for this review where?
Like, I don't know how many times he told me, like after I selected to like get some food when I needed it or like just like or whatever I got.
50:40
And he's just like, oh, I bet you're grateful for the aren't you.
And I'm just like, I cannot I I don't don't tell.
Me.
I'm grateful.
I'm.
Fucking not grateful.
Fucking take the food back.
I don't need this food.
I just got this food because it was presented to me.
I just like I.
I got 30 food in my bag.
50:56
I'm I'm overflowing with food here.
Right.
And then in the second one when I for the time I played it.
He really pipes down quite a bit like the amount of like he's they finally realized, I think that OK, there's a level that he's above the annoying level right now.
He's got to be like talk less and when he does talk make it more relevant to what's happening and.
51:15
So yeah, I think that's that's the big difference.
That's what happened.
Yeah, it's not like the Warcraft two style, like every time you Click to make him move, he says the same thing, right?
Your food is under attack.
You require additional food, bylaws, etcetera.
51:34
But yeah, like he actually said, like things relevant to the cards almost exclusively.
And also I guess just in in two there's less just oh, here's a card that gives you food.
It's almost always something that just happens to give you a boon at the end.
51:52
I guess in Will's defense, a little bit like.
The There There are times where I'm like, I'm trying to read the thing and I can't, like, multiprocess between like, reading and having the narrator be like, oh, well, that's an interesting option, huh?
Would you look at the text right there without me talking?
That'd be really great, wouldn't it?
52:08
And like, the times where I was playing on the bus, I'm just like, muted, no headphones or anything, and I'm just like, okay.
I can sit here, I can read the text at my own leisure.
I'm aware of the dealer in the background.
He's jostling around making some kind of a quip.
But I can.
52:24
I can.
I can see it in both ways.
I can see like the snarkiness of the narrator being like a fun bit of spice, but I think it's a little overspiced in hand to Fate one and I think just got the the oregano right for the sequel.
So if they were making hand to Fate Three, the other other hand, what would you?
52:46
What would you change?
What would you add?
What do you think?
That, that, that last spice, the the, the MSG to to take it over the top.
Trend maybe go ahead.
Oh, I think like there is there's an unexplored aspect to like the Batman style combat that I think that like if they if they lean into that maybe a little more because like right now it's like it's a little jarring that like the card stuff is like it's it's either card or Batman.
53:18
And if that's either like more seamlessly integrated or like if you're in like a Batman Arkham City style game and you're running around and like oh like I can only get into this building here if I do this dumb card thing or you know, like there's obviously people way smarter than me than this that can crack this code.
53:35
But if either like the combat is more like combo driven, so you have that kind of like oh not like instead of just equipment, you know, you have cards that can like build out combos or things like that.
Interesting, interesting idea to explore there.
But I think like, I don't.
53:53
Yeah, I don't know, like there's a lot of text stuff that could be done.
You could do something like if you like, there's the ones that are like do a pickpocket things like you could just have it be like you're going in and now you're you're like you're a little dude, your cartoon man is going in, You have to like click.
54:11
The QuickTime event at the right moments to to do the the pickpocketing.
Thing One thing, one thing that I was actually kind of surprised that wasn't into was going into a market store and like, your options are like, okay.
I can only like, buy stuff.
I can buy equipment or I can buy food.
Give me the option to be like the chaotic archetype of like stealing food and losing fame or like trading resources.
54:36
Yeah, and like.
Yeah, I think, you know they they hit a lot of stuff right with Hand of Fate too.
It's it's I think a testament that I'm struggling to think of what they could improve, improve on.
Yeah, Dalia is our resident Hand of Fate lover.
54:53
Anything that you would.
I think adding like I I think in order to keep that that secret blend of herbs and spices right you got to improve both sides of it.
I I agree that the the combat is a little shallow.
55:09
And I don't know how you widen that out without like expanding it so big that it's no longer that.
Sort of like I like the fact that you get dropped into like 5 square foot room and you just beat the absolute crap out of some skeletons for a minute and then you're done.
But at the same time, expanding what you can do in that feels like a natural next step, but I'll feel like.
55:30
No matter what, it has to be small.
The thing that you're dropped into, Yeah, it can be that.
It's a bite.
Still a little bite.
You're talking about?
Again, to bring out the Zelda oh, now you're racing horses.
Oh, here's one scenario.
Now you're you're finding skeleton like spiders or whatever the hell they are, and then now you're doing these other things.
55:48
But they're all like, they're not all combat.
They're all very distinct sort of things in this continuous landscape of things to do.
Well then have we just recreated Mario Party?
Ooh no.
I've cracked it.
I finally cracked it Mario.
This idea of discreets.
56:03
We need to add.
That's what we.
Need we need a Mario in it.
Italian plumbers is The thing is this.
Hand of Face Missing oregano car racer?
Actually in in my Factoid section here.
Did you know there's a A Hand of Fate board game?
No wait.
Maybe I saw that on tabletops.
56:20
Is it a board game or is it a card game?
Because I think it should.
Be a card game.
I mean it's maybe it's both.
It is.
It is a table top game with little mini figs.
That on Kickstarter I think what where was I seeing they had pledged pledged 30,000 to develop this and they got Australian dollars $490,000 to fund this thing and shockingly not not too poorly rated on board game geek which I'm I'm like but yeah like if they if OK.
56:55
Here's what I cracked.
They put that Kickstarter game as like a Pokémon trading card, open world thing in the wild.
Boom.
We figured it out.
Make it happen.
Well, I don't like Breath of the Wild, though I wasn't actually thinking.
That's a good.
Game Well, that's you being wrong.
57:12
I mean, it's meant for children, really.
It's a puzzle game for children.
Right.
The people love Breath of the Wild.
Hand of Fade Too is a puzzle game for adults.
Sorry Dolly.
I feel like I cut you off, though before you were saying something about both sides of the.
Yeah, I mean, I think you can, you can guess what the other half is.
57:30
They do the same bullshit they did in the in between 1:00 and 2:00, between 2:00 and 3:00 for the cards.
They they make it so that, you know, there's the little chance mini games, they add one or two more of those they like.
They make new scenarios that make use of a fourth resource, You know, they just.
57:49
Iterates slightly on it, cuz that part I feel like it's solid.
If you're in it for just the fighting, you're going to be disappointed if you're in it for doing that, that thing we all love, which is getting that little piece of candy from from the the dealer by doing weird things to unlock it.
58:07
They they keep that, they're golden.
Yeah.
OKI think.
What is the ERRC grid?
I think is it the applicable is that we got to reduce, raise, creates and eliminates.
58:26
And so if you apply this sort of methodology to like an already novel idea, you can basically create new novelty out of it.
And in this case what would you eliminate?
What would you reduce, raise, create?
You know, I guess it's a whole other discussion.
We're already the ratings, never mind.
But this is the framework that game creator should be thinking about in general.
58:44
It's like it's.
We'll get GPT 4 on it, and that'll that'll solve all of our problems.
Yeah, there we go.
That's what.
That's what it needs.
It needs GPT 4 to just create new cards for you on the fly and then and then have it be the voice of the the narrator, just be auto generated.
59:00
As an AI language model, I am unable to provide a context for for this Fate selection, but as an AI language model, we also have to jump into the rankings because we have an e-mail to get.
To yes.
Let's I think I'll go first.
59:21
Unsurprisingly I think Hand of Fade One, while fun to come back to I think just pales in comparison and basically every regard to Hand of Fate Two.
I was actually like kind of surprised at how well polished 2 was over one.
But I think like the only reason to kind of revisit Hand of Fate One would be like if you have it in your backlog.
59:44
You maybe have played it once before and you're like, I don't know, should I go back to it?
I would say yeah, go back to it if you didn't have Hand of Fate 2 in your library.
If you have #2 in your library and you're suffering the the same fate, definitely go back in and play two.
I think it's it's pretty dope ranking wise.
1:00:01
I'm going to put Hand of Fate One just above Dungeons of Dreadmore and just behind Invisible Ink and kind of like my my solid middle meaty pack of the of the Curve.
All good games, but I think you know the the sequel just leaps and bounds better.
1:00:20
Hand it fake to him, putting just behind Binding of Isaac, Rebirth and just the head of Worse in the realm of Oslona.
It's fun.
Play it.
I'll go next.
I have very similar feelings, very similar rankings to Scott.
1:00:39
The same rankings as Scott, which just shifted both games slightly.
One higher.
So Hand of Faith tonight, #4 out of 19 games.
And yeah, I think that it was like I said, bite size before.
1:00:54
It's like tapas.
It's like a little tapas of a game each each you go through each little card and you get a little little taste of of of of combat for each little thing.
Like it's not like eating a hearty steak.
It's a bunch of little delightful, little delightful bites.
1:01:12
And then you go on to like have the waiter tell you a story about the man whose family was taken from him or something.
But yeah, I liked Hanna Fate 2 better than Hanna Fate One.
I think it's the the logical and creative conclusion to what they put in Hanna Fate One.
1:01:31
And if you play one of them, only play Hanna Fate 2.
I'll jump and last that way and that way you get the the final words on this.
So I think I'm just going to follow more of the trend to be honest.
I know it's weird for us to agree and mostly agree.
1:01:47
I think I think from Scott to calling to myself, we're all I shift.
It's shifting up in the upward direction where I thought my opinion from what was it 2019 or whatever I played Hannah Fade 2 was a 7.5 and so that's what I gave it then.
That's what I'm going to say I would.
1:02:04
Well I'm not going to.
I can't.
I'm not going to rate it again because obviously coming back to the game I would rate it lower because the novel, he's gone.
But Hand of Fate won.
I gave a 5.5 again Hand Fate Two was a 7.5.
Which means that on the the rankings list, Hannah Fates, it's actually, I love to say this, it was better than Risk of Rain.
1:02:24
It was better than cogmind, especially.
This is all good company.
But at a 5.5, that's below the recommend threshold of 6, so I can't.
I can't recommend it.
Hanna Fate 2 ranked three, so it's just falling behind.
Yeah, and I'm actually, I'm looking at our average rank and Hanna Fate two is now the number two game because all of our other highly ranked games have at least one of us which deeply disliked it and so the fact that we all.
1:02:53
Really much liked an FA2.
It's the number two game now behind FTL.
Wait.
What's our overall one?
It's.
FTL.
I mean that's great.
Dolly is our is our special guest and the whopping 2 games that you've you've been on the podcast with us thus far.
1:03:13
Many more to come in the future I'm sure.
Which which one I wonder tops out at your number one?
I'm going to say that Hand of Fate One is the worst game I have ever I have ever reviewed for this podcast.
And Hand of Fate Two is at least twice as good as one, making it my number one pick of reviewed games for this podcast.
1:03:38
Yes, if you have Hand of Fate One in your library and you don't have Hand of Fate Two, please send me an e-mail.
And maybe I will buy it for you cuz I think it's $8.
Just play hand of Fate 2.
It's not.
It's like $5 right now.
It's on sale.
Yeah, it's it's really good.
1:03:55
And there's it.
Literally in every single instance is replaced by Hand of Fate 2.
The only context you're missing is that at the end of Hand of Fate One, you the player beat up the dealer guy and take his place.
And that's the entire point.
1:04:12
Of what's happening in hand of Fake Two is he's training you to beat up your previous character.
There's.
Pokémon Gold Silver in this.
Spoilers.
You can be Professor Oak.
We have a an e-mail this week which I'm going to dump into into the chat here for people to read, but I will.
1:04:38
And he'll read through this e-mail that we've gotten from our our good friend Davian.
Davian, look, okay, it's spelled FUXAI got the pronunciation.
Guide from Davian.
I don't.
Say Davian folks, because maybe Davian folks, you know.
1:05:00
I do feel like we should.
You should dope that pronunciation guide in there some point.
Yeah, like the what's the like the Wikipedia linguistic thing, anyway?
Yes, Davion says.
Greetings again, Scott, Will and Colin.
And in this case, Dalia.
1:05:15
Congratulations on continuing with your podcast and exploring various games with Rogue something attached to them.
I do have a question in regards whether your podcast will exclusively cover various games on Steam or you if you will eventually branch in out into delve into other topics related to the Rogue genre.
For example, it has been less about half a month since the annual competition for the seven day Rogue like challenge concluded.
1:05:38
Entrance to this year's jam is still under review, but it likely won't be long before the judging process is complete.
About 30% of the reviews still need to be done and this this is a proceeded lightning speed of the past couple years.
Whole disclosure, I know this because I'm one of the reviewers this year and I'm directly interacting with Darren Gray, who organizes the latter workings of getting games.
1:05:56
Judged.
Another obvious topic is interviews with various developers of noteworthy games within the genre.
This is something that we don't typically see anymore and would like would likely be a good resource for people looking to learn about the inner workings of the games we play.
Hoping to see this podcast continue on for a long time into the future, Devian.
1:06:17
Dave and F Dave and F Dave and F the group officer for the Steamroller group and from Dave and plays on YouTube.
Thanks for writing into the show Dave and it's always good to see emails rolling in.
I think the first question about covering games exclusive to Steam, the ones the reason why I picked up the data set for Steam games to start with.
1:06:41
It's just it's the biggest one, unsurprisingly.
I think I've said we have like something of like 6000 games to pick from that particular catalog and I have.
I've I've tried desperately to yank that data out of itch dot I/O but it is not nearly as conveniently packaged.
1:06:59
But there are some non Steam games on our list that are for sure stay tunes if slash when we get to them.
Including but not limited to the original 1980 Rd. which is technically on Steam but I have.
Look, if the Allen Computer Museum was still open, I had plans for us to take a field trip down there to play the original Rogue on an Apple Two or a PDP11.
1:07:23
Comp would be down.
That'd be fun.
There is and comparing it with the non Steam, I think it's open source, question mark release version brogue which I think would be a comparison.
There's a lot of Rogue like mobile games out there which I think are.
1:07:40
Like, pretty well done and worthy of inclusion the conversation.
Like chattered pixel Dungeon.
There's pathos.
Net Hack Hop Light are ones that come to mind.
Magic Survival.
The one that inspired vampire survivors.
A super.
1:07:56
Stay tuned for Dalia to come back to talk about Ilona and Dolly.
Have you heard of Ilona the Rogue like before?
It sounds familiar, but it my my my mind screen is blank.
You would, I think you would really like that game.
It's Super JRPG.
1:08:14
There's there's lots of interesting stuff about it, but there's also like a handful of, you know, Super Super Nintendo and Genesis Rogue, likes like the original Toe Jam and Earl, maybe question mark.
So there's definitely a lot of stuff that that we can cover.
1:08:31
Outside of Steam, it's just Steam is just the biggest data set that we have at the moment.
Seven Day Rogue likes.
Have has anyone else heard of seven day Rogue likes before?
I mean, I haven't heard of Seven Day Rogue like specifically, but like the the game jam style thing is something I've absolutely heard of.
1:08:49
So I'm assuming it's just the same concept as applied to like specifically Rogue likes.
And I think honestly a Rogue like is much.
More achievable goal to create in seven days, like you could create an OK Rogue like in seven days you can't create like an OK Skyrim.
1:09:10
So like Roblex already are built on the idea of having a little bit more limited of a of a scope from the the the technical side and be more focused on either some novelty thing or just using your imagination for good chunks of it so.
1:09:29
And I think because of our our once every two week release cadence, unless like we're absolutely dying to cover some like 7 day Rd. like game jam game, I think it's probably better for us to wait until it's like come out of incubation a little bit and mature it a little there's and you know like.
1:09:52
Like Cogmind, there's there's some on our list that have evolved out of the seven day Rogue Lake game jam.
Like Golden Crown Hotel is a really fun one.
I don't remember if Rift Wizard was a seven day Rogue Lake, but things like that are definitely on our list for sure.
1:10:08
If we did, if we did it, we'd probably do the whole challenge as one episode of like we played a bunch of these games for like 10 minutes and.
This is the one that we like the most out of 10 minutes.
1:10:24
So and probably we wouldn't be able to give.
I mean it looks like there's nine or there were nine in the original.
I don't know there's there's a, there's a number of them.
I don't think we would really be able to give all of them the time that they deserve.
1:10:41
So we would have to give them equally not enough time.
It's hard enough to get Will to to not tear his eyeballs out while playing Cogmine So.
It might be a tall order for for some of these even more extreme indie level games which like you know, I mean we have a YouTube channel, there's no reason why we couldn't just do like hey let's check these out, but I don't know if those would make podcast episodes specifically.
1:11:09
And then lastly like with related to interviews with developers I feel like.
There's there's a lot of overlap between those kinds of ideas with the original the the Big Daddy Rd. like podcast, Rd. like radio which they do interviews with developers they do like you know covering the seven day Rd. like jams, all great stuff.
1:11:32
Go check that out.
There's there's another good podcast that does like very much more dev centric interview stuff called.
Eggplant The Secret Life of games that I've been listening to lately.
Very well produced program don't download their show, download ours, cannibalization of audience etc.
1:11:51
But I found out about their show through ChatGPT somehow cuz I had no idea that that was a thing that existed until I was like.
Interesting story.
I wish you'd tell.
I was like, hey Chad, GB T what are the best Rogue like podcast?
1:12:07
Fish fish compliment, compliment.
And it was like, whoa, you should go check out rogue like radio.
Unsurprisingly, you should go check out this Spelunky podcast like Spelunky podcast.
Oh, like they it seems like.
I think they had pivoted away from a podcast entirely about Spelunky one and two to other stuff and all the better for that.
1:12:27
But I think like.
Similarly, coming back to having people on the show to talk about games that they like and us like, holding back from bashing on it.
If we had someone who would like spent 15 years developing this game and will just like.
1:12:48
Point me out as if, yeah, that's probably what would happen.
That's almost exactly what would happen.
Yeah, that that thick, thick, thick skin.
I think the problem is that we're not actually we're all frauds and we don't.
We probably don't love Rogue like games enough.
Like, I I think they're they're fun and interesting, but they're not like my number one passion.
1:13:11
And I I'm very much enjoy.
Yes, exactly.
Fashion is my #1 passion.
No.
But like Rogue, like games are are fun and interesting to play because you can you can they they're small enough that you can.
1:13:29
Kind of.
Actually go through them and not destroy yourself trying to do one every other week.
I did have a.
I would be, I would be worried to have someone on there and be like, no, I don't like your game.
I did have a like a card in the back of pocket of something involving rogue like developers, but not talking about the game that they developed.
1:13:53
Because then that gives us at least some option.
Being like, man, that gave us a real stinker, huh?
And then being like, Oh yeah, it was huh.
So at least it gives us that door.
Door to.
Open.
I feel like if we had someone on our podcast, we couldn't play their game.
We would just have to have them like or.
I mean there are games out there then.
1:14:09
Like, I don't really like this game, but I'm fascinated by like the way that it was developed or I want it to succeed so much.
So like something like as war SIM.
I didn't like war SIM, but I would be.
Fascinated to talk to the person who made it.
1:14:26
Because best friends with the creator of war SIM.
Yeah, and like, I would probably have more fun making War SIM than I did playing it, because then you're starting to be like, that's a different kind of game.
The puzzle is the game making itself.
1:14:42
Right.
Yeah, I think between like the podcast audio only medium that we put out once every two weeks.
A YouTube platform that, I don't know, maybe we'll do something with question mark and every podcast has to have a Patreon, right?
Maybe we could jam something into that.
1:14:58
So I think all these things are definite Stay tunes, depending on podcast host availability and schedules and interest in these kinds of things.
I think like we're all somewhat interested in these things, but just trying to figure out when and where to put them is is the question.
1:15:15
But yeah.
Right.
And also like.
How many people are actually listening?
I I know if you and at least one other person.
We always have 100 YouTube views, so.
You know.
We well, for posterity reasons.
You know, when people are looking back on this podcast 10,000 years from now as the thing that really kick started the Second Renaissance, they're going to be like wow, they only had triple digit viewership at that point before the Joe Rogan podcast bottom out and then it became the number one in the world.
1:15:45
It's incredible.
Joe Rogue like Joe Rogue like I I.
Love how much I hate that.
Yeah, I I wouldn't listen to that.
Did we decide what we're doing for next week?
Well before that, before that as we wind down here, Dahlia, thank you for for being on the podcast this week.
1:16:08
Any future shows for sure?
Do you have anything that you want to plug or promote or?
Uses a as a grandstand for for the podcast for the next 35 seconds.
No, not really.
1:16:25
Okay.
Excellent.
What's your favorite game that's not this one?
I spent literally all of Sunday playing my time at Sand Rock.
It's pretty good, but it's still in Early Access, so I don't know that I recommend it to anybody.
All right, well, there's a game that exists.
1:16:42
There's a game that exists, and if you're thinking about buying it, someone else already did.
There you go.
Can't have more ringing endorsement than that.
Excellent social media plugs Grog pod zone@gmail.com if you want to send us in an e-mail to read on the show.
1:16:58
I've been trying to respond back to YouTube comments but you hard hard to do that.
But if you want something guaranteed to read on the show, send it there.
Mastodon grog pod at game dev dot place.
And all all of our rankings, previous episodes, all that good stuff can be found on our website at Grog Pod dot Zone.
1:17:17
Our next episode, I think we we had the ability to to card shuffle between our dealer chosen grouping of Streets of Rogue, Gunfire Reborn and Loop Hero, and I think we've kind of whittled it down to maybe Streets of Rogue at this point.
1:17:34
Is that right or do we have to have a coin flip off again?
Loop.
Hero looked.
Interesting.
It might be more fun.
I know I've played like probably 20 minutes of Streets of Rogue, so like, I know it'll be at least OK Lupiro looks fun, but you know, don't know.
1:17:50
I would be down for a coin flip, but I'll let you guys weigh in on what you want to do here.
I mean without without trying to put too much thumbhose pressure on the scale streets of Rogue, you can do a four player local split split screen of all 8 characters.
1:18:05
So I'm just going.
To throw that.
I've played, I played I own Loop Hero.
It's pretty good.
We should probably play it someday, but I'm ready for some some rogue streets.
I want to be an ape hooking and punching things.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
1:18:23
Alright.
Next episode, pencil it in for some.
We're hitting the streets.
The streets of Rogue.
We're going to, We're going to put on some ape suits for that, I think.
Alright, we'll see you next time.
With that.
1:18:39
Very clever outro.
Yes, the.
Outro segment is here and now it is no more.
