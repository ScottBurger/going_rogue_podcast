Hello and welcome to the Grog Pod Rogue Like Podcast where each episode we rip open a booster pack of a video game, examine what we like and don't like, and use it to upgrade our existing deck of previous played games for our end of season tournament to the death.
0:50
I am your host of said podcast, Dancing With the Devil in the Pale Moonlight Scott Burger, and With me are my fellow podcast jokers.
Guess I'll go first here.
Yeah, this is Will.
You're the last unlockable Joker that you'll never get, because it's a one in a five chance after a one in 400 chance.
1:12
This is Andrew.
And don't forget about the Joker Harshman.
And this is Colin.
I'm not even a joker, I'm just like a 7/7 of clubs, just random card in the deck.
But a 10 in our hearts this week we're going all in with Bellatro.
1:32
This is this is our new record holder for our freshest hot off the press game released February 20th, 2024 a whopping 22 days ago.
Beating our previous record of our freshest look of a game which was our unfortunate Darkest Dungeon two episode where we reviewed it 29 days after release.
1:57
But I think.
Of the contrast.
Yeah we'll we'll we'll have some good stuff to say.
I think this time Bellatro, you can this is a amazingly find it anywhere kind of game even just after 22 days being being out Switch, Steam, PlayStation, Xbox if you can think of it you can find it on there.
2:16
This was made.
I think this is the debut game by a developer that I can't find a whole much about doxing wise.
It's got lots of lots of good interesting interviews out there which good on them.
But I think this is their debut game by local Thunk who I think was.
2:36
Also, we could probably round this up to be a solo dev effort, but there's there's you know, some help with like art assets and music and stuff like that.
But anyway, this was published by Play Stack Games which we might remember from a Souls Light game, Mortal Shell.
2:53
Another game the case of the Golden Idol and our favorite widely canned top down shooter of Axolotl.
And in Bellatro.
Your average Bellatro player has about 30 hours of gameplay in it already for just 22 days.
3:12
I think will will under score that in that kind of investment and the Bellatro rolls in on our on our list of Rogue like games as the number 65 most popular Rogue game only 22 days already the 65th most popular game with 16,187 total reviews.
3:33
Wow.
Andrew, you're up against the needle and you can only play A1 sentence hand to describe Bellatro.
Bellatro is a game that you play on a touch screen CRT monitor in a bowling alley.
3:54
Yeah, imagine like video poker, but oh boy, with all sorts of twists and turns and fun cards that stack together and synergize and cause all sorts of wild excitement.
Let me tell you, it's like poker.
It's like solitaire, but with a fresh infusion of all sorts of cards with all sorts of interesting, engaging effects.
4:13
And boy is it hard sometimes.
I have a question for you, Scott.
I have a question for everybody, actually.
Pronunciation Guide Bellatro.
So yeah, I think.
This ALATRO.
The, I think the the Wikipedia definition for a whatever this word is, you look it up, it's like this is what a a court jester was in the in like the early Roman era and that was pronounced balatro.
4:44
A balatro is a court jester.
But I think the developer has come out and said you know what, It doesn't really matter.
That's right.
And I've been watching some some Youtubers and streamers and they all, everyone says Balatro.
So I think we have to go, it's pretty ubiquitous, OK, we got to go with the flow.
5:01
We could, we could say Balatro every time and be pretentious about it.
Well, that's kind of fun.
But yeah, I with these sorts of, you know, pronunciation conversations, I feel like, you know, it's just depends on what region you're fun from, what, whatever.
Whichever side of the Roman Empire you're on, you say it a little bit different.
5:17
Here's the don't, don't listen to the British, you know, narrator of the trailer.
Don't listen to that guy.
Ball of TRO.
Ball of tro is a game.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You got to say it like a Mexican football announcer.
Yo necesito mucho Grande balatro is I think the the the way they really hit it.
5:38
Balatro.
Oh, even better.
Now we're talking, and this comes to us, of course, courtesy of Will.
Yes, which comes.
Courtesy of Scott So.
Yeah it helps to have be compulsively online and and watching this game shoot up basically everywhere where everyone is saying, Oh my God, this game is this game is so good is this is this game the next best thing since Slay the Spire.
6:06
And there was, there was a time, late 2023 where there was something that, you know, there was a game called Cobalt Core that came out and people were like, huh, this is an interesting mash up between like FTL style management and Slay the Aspire style deck building.
6:24
And for a while people were kind of talking like, oh, this is going to be the next big thing since Slay the Aspire.
This is going to be the next big thing.
And it's, it seems like a pretty cromulent game.
But this is like something else entirely.
This is like it's such a tsunami of like I don't even know what it this is.
6:42
This is like we're sitting here 22 days after release in the lightning in the bottle moment where everyone is losing their shit online of like this.
This is the game.
This is the the the rogue like deck builder since slave aspire but.
Only the lead worked early.
To play it more today before the podcast, I had to really restrain myself.
7:02
It has its neon claws in you.
Wait, Scott, do you have any temporal stats that are like you know for like all these 'cause you gave the the 6060 fifth most popular, I think Rogue like, but like what?
What do you what would you what do we have stats for like the 1st 22 days when we don't look at like things like reviews if we just look at like.
7:19
That would be a great question for.
Players over 22 days, 'cause I think it's like one of the top games of all time.
Well, well, yeah.
So scroll, scroll, scroll.
There was something.
Yeah.
So gosh, what was it on February 24th?
7:36
How many days after?
So four days, four days after release.
This will this will kind of answer your question.
So slay the Spire had its all time peak of concurrent players about six years ago and Bellatro four days after release.
7:54
Beat that by like 500 like concurrent players now.
There's Bellagio didn't have Early Access at all, did.
It no, it just had a there was the Steam Nextfest demo, which was kind of the thing that that catapulted it into popularity, I think.
8:12
It had like, truly like an alpha, but then no, none.
None of the like.
Oh well, it's been in Early Access for six years, actually.
Like it just appeared fully formed on the scene.
Demo.
What a what?
A what a quaint sort of throwback to a long forgotten age.
8:28
Y'all played the the demo.
What?
I'm just curious, what was the format like?
You only got up to a certain ante or something.
I only played the demo for like 15 minutes, 'cause I like everyone was losing their shit about it during the Steam Nexfest event.
And I thought, OK, yeah, I'll download it, give it a shot, OK, poker cards.
8:45
I got it.
I'm.
I'm going to go back to playing, I think it was tome at the time and and yeah, I mean like it seemed OK, but I'm glad we had the sit down focus time with it today because or for the past two weeks cause like that that 15 minute intro view of it.
9:08
And I I think like, the demo itself is actually really robust, 'cause people were saying they dumped like 30-40 hours into the demo.
It probably just doesn't have as much stuff as the full release version.
But I think, yeah, if if you pick it up and you're like, OK, I think I might like this, then I think the full version is right up your alley.
9:28
Sure, I can dig it now.
So Will.
This was sent over via Discord for your approval a number of weeks ago.
And at what point?
How quickly did you decide?
Like, Oh yes, there's something here.
First session.
First session, right?
On the Batalog.
How many hours was that?
9:44
It was 4 hours.
I I.
Picked it up and I'm like, oh, what's this game?
Four hours later I'm like, oh guys, this is a possible 10 out of 10 here.
And then I said we, we need to do this.
So it was, it was it was pretty immediate.
10:02
You would like 20 hours into this before we even picked the game.
Yeah, and I want, I'm not even gonna tell you how many hours I have into it now to kind of hide the fact that this has become essentially what is a full time job this.
Has become essential, essential to your existence.
Yeah, you know it would be.
10:19
It's not a stretch to say like if if you just looked at our Discord history it seems like we might convert to Bellatro Podcast.
Basically full time grog grogtro.
We'll, we'll workshop the name here I am with my Joker's gallery.
10:39
All right, but anyway.
But well, it was the.
You don't want to disclose the number of hours, but I would like to hear what how many hours other people have.
My stats are as follows. 22 hours, 96 out of 150 jokers and two victory screens.
10:56
All right, I need to go.
Oh, that's what I was going to check.
I need to figure out how many wins I actually got on average.
Well, while you're doing that in my poultry 12:00-ish hours of play I have, I don't know what my I mean, I can boot my steam deck up here right now, but I'm vamping for to give Colin as much time as possible.
11:16
I have a whopping 0 victories in 12 hours.
You didn't get.
I thought you had well.
You know, I I frankly find it shocking, Scott, that you weren't able to get one.
This is a call back to our previous episode.
Didn't mean to put you on blast, but sorry to hear that.
11:35
And I feel your pain.
Definitely feel your pain.
It took me like my second victory was a long time coming.
Well, yeah.
I mean, I think I used up all of my luck for our previous Against the Storm episode, where I somehow eked out a victory every single time.
11:53
And in this game, it's it's felt like victory has been within grasp.
And then, like the Joker clown just comes out of the shadows and just ships me right in the ribs and I just crumpled to the floor.
I have 13.5 hours and that's mostly because I was on vacation for like a full 8 days of this so I had less time to play than than normal and I have I'm going to I'm going to call it 3.9 wins because that last one was.
12:28
I can't explain to you how guaranteed it was until I was like I want to get over 1000 bolt and so I I I want to have like the most multiplier possible and I was like I'm going to do this this thing and immediately was like oh right I have the joker that eats the other jokers and therefore my plan is failed and I lose.
12:53
But I was like, so guaranteed to win.
I was this was the round of the final joker like the round before.
And I just like, well, I guess I'll just just just delete my, delete my run.
So.
That is unfortunate.
We press have to pay our respects to that run.
13:12
And hey, Speaking of jokers, what what what?
What does it do with these jokers?
Doesn't wanna explain this mechanic.
Yeah, wait, we shouldn't explain what this game is at all.
No, we we should keep it as vague as possible like. 15 minutes and we have not explained how this game works.
Well, I said.
13:27
It's video.
Code.
OK, well, I'll put a.
I'll put a flag in this.
I do wanna get back to you.
I got my stats here, but go ahead.
Oh dear.
God.
Yeah, I think like so we we typically kick off descriptions about what goes on in these games with with like your story intro bit.
13:44
Oh yeah, lay it on us.
What's the rich storyline here?
Yeah, What's will?
What's?
What's the deep lore for?
For Balatro.
Yeah, you sit down in Las Vegas at a well, actually I think Andrew's likening this to like a bowling alley style like game is actually quite apropos because the like the I don't know if they're trying to simulate like acrt like rounded like ye oldie like I think that's what they're trying to do.
14:12
So it's got that sort of a weird aesthetic with like a lava lamp background going on.
But essentially there is no story whatsoever.
There's a little joker that walks you through the tutorial and that laughs at you when you lose at the very end.
But other than that there's no narrative whatsoever.
14:30
So it's it's even.
More bears than be a landlord.
It might be the least narrative game we've played, yeah.
Did Rogue Tower?
No.
Rogue Tower had zero narrative to it, right it?
Had the flavor text of the the units.
Yeah, OK.
14:45
It doesn't even have that.
Right.
Yeah, but yeah, like this is so this is your I have written down this is a rogue like deck builder, but you start with a full deck of cards.
This is like the gap.
You know you're at the end of the checkout line in Safeway.
15:02
You see one of those packs of 52 playing cards?
Boom, you're halfway to an actual game of Bellagio right there.
Incorrect.
Well, you take one of those off the shelves, you put it down in front of you, and you, you are challenged with a set of three objectives per round.
15:20
And each objective is like you have your your small blind boss fight.
I guess you have your big blind boss fight and then you have like the the round boss fight which is yeah, the the ante, the auntie as the auto.
15:36
The autocorrect was saying and.
Yeah, my Auntie Blind.
She would always make it awesome.
You know, souffle for Christmas.
And you play, you play poker hands to score points and you over a certain point threshold.
15:52
Congratulations, you win and you're taken to the shop where you shop till you drop with some gold that you've accrued based on XY and Z conditions.
Sorry to interrupt.
Why are you all calling it gold?
Oh, that's that's what you call calling.
16:09
It gold all all this whole time.
And it's money and I got confirmed like is there another galactic credits?
Right.
Sorry to interrupt.
Yes, you go to the store.
A circus of values, if you will.
And you're presented with some options.
You know, you could buy a joker card, which modifies elements of how things are scored.
16:28
You could buy different cards to add to your deck.
Maybe I want to buy another 10.
Maybe.
Maybe I want to buy a lucky 7 of clubs.
Maybe I want to buy this other completely insane thing that I've never seen in a a card based game before.
16:45
This was just made of stone.
Things like that, modifiers to your heart's content.
And then when you, when you're all set, you go to the next round and that's that's kind of the gameplay loop as far as I understand now, Will's third eye has opened and he has seen beyond the galactic plane of what this game really is.
17:08
Yeah, yeah.
Will Will plays this game like basically all of us were in tone, like playing his hobbits, and he started as a sorcerer and he did the sorcerer opening.
He's on in a galactic realm, shooting lightning bolts and firing up his Shields.
17:24
And another level indeed.
It's like a a he.
He's Sauron.
Or maybe like Sauron.
I'm.
I'm Aragorn.
You guys are Mary and Pippen.
Yeah, I tried picking.
Up two wins, which is infinitely exponentially.
What's the What's the mathematical term more than 0?
17:41
To be clear, I'm obviously.
Well, it's it's plus two more than 0.
Not times two more than 0.
Which, as Will will likely explain, there's a whole bunch of wacky, I think this game, you know what this game is?
This game is secretly something developed by math teachers to get people excited about statistics.
18:00
That's what it is.
Yeah, sorry, Will.
Yes, the floor is yours.
No, I I think that this game is poker folded into poker, which is to say like you essentially like when you start talking about the third eye, like once you've played like enough and just to give a sense of it, like here I'm looking at the deck stakes or deck stake win statistic, this thing I've got about 53 out of 120.
18:25
So that's just the ones that like count towards progress.
I think I probably have in total like something like 70 wins and I have 339 out of the 340 in the collection I like.
That's why I started this off with on that one last legendary joker that I have not and I was really hoping to have a complete collection but not quite there.
18:44
I know that like at 22 days in, I think it was like four or five days ago.
I got the all the vouchers and there's like a little achievement for that and that put me in the top .6% of players.
So that means that I put way more time into this game than than I probably should.
19:01
But yeah, when I say that it's poker folded into poker, I mean that like you, you see the the cards, like regular playing cards.
You get a sense of, Oh yeah, like this is like, you know, poker.
There's a bunch of new rules, like different hand sizes and all that fun stuff.
And like all these, the calculations that determine score, which is different than like if you're playing against other players and you have to like essentially bluff or or have a better hand.
19:22
There's none of that here.
All you have to do is play hands that add up to above that score.
And so the way where it becomes like folded into to to itself is with the jokers that you have because these jokers are, even though they don't have suits and they don't have ranks like a a playing card deck, you can see that like the suit is essentially the synergies that they have amongst each other.
19:45
And so you can start to see that like, oh, if I have these two or these three things together, this is like a three of a kind of jokers.
And once you have the three of a kind of jokers, the interaction that has with your, the type of deck that you have becomes more pronounced.
And there's lots of different sorts of ways of evoking these, this beautiful landscape of of of synergies amongst the different jokers, the different sorts of modifications that you can have to your deck.
20:11
And amongst well what else is there the the, the, the consumable cards that you can play and the upgrades to the hands that you get.
So overall this all comes, this is a very elaborate math equation.
And so that's why the fact that you can go in and actually like start to solve this and start to determine what optimal play is just by running statistics.
20:33
I mean I'm I'm literally I've got R open.
I've been I've run millions of simulations that determine like you know little known fact here you know and I'm I'll, I'll release this for people out there that want it, 'cause I I'm pretty sure there's gonna be high demand but like if you draw 4, if you draw four of one suit and you have a 8 card hand, what is the likelihood if you discard those four that are not in that suit and draw four more, what's the likelihood that you hit a flush?
20:59
Well, it's zero in my case because every single time I try doing that, it's like, oh tough shit, you're just you're gonna get two or like one of each and you're just going to, like, throw all of your discards in the trash anyway, Continue.
Well, how far through the playthrough are we?
21:15
Do we have a 52 deck or do we have or have we added to it?
There's so many layers.
What the The purpose of this was to determine how to beat the first boss, which is assuming that you're doing 2 skips in the beginning, which we can get into like some of the meta game and the gaming of the gimmicky sort of element of this.
21:31
But like I really wanted to learn like how do I optimize that first battle before you do any center, like you know, essentially make it so that all the numbers get really wacky really quickly.
And I mean the, the, the not that it really matters, but the quick answer is that it's 60%.
And then if you do it again, if you don't get any of that card and you draw again four more, it bumps up to 90%.
21:49
And if you have a third discard, it bumps up to 99%.
And so that's kind of how you can look at these things.
You can look at the numbers for if you have three of a kind.
If you have you know there's all this there's a finite number of initial positions from which you can make these decisions and so you can there's a you can I know the the the ultimate solution here will be you enter in the hand that you have and it tells you exactly what you should do.
22:11
And so that's what I'm I'm trying to build towards right now.
But yeah now it's all it's all slowly becoming intuitive and so I.
Just I can talk.
For hours about sure this is going to be a Steam guide soon I hope.
Something something like that usually.
I'll just, I'll post it to Reddit with like my a link to my my recent like my either my GitHub or the.
22:30
In your in your Kofi, your Kofi, your coffee.
Now I think what Will's trying to get AT is that this game is like the definition of easy to learn, difficult to master.
You fire this game up and you're having fun almost immediately and you hardly even have to know what you're doing.
22:46
You hardly like me.
I I I like playing games by feel.
I don't like crunching the numbers.
I can't be bothered to crunch numbers, nor am I even capable oftentimes of doing it.
I know that one out of 52 is something that's that that means something.
But yeah, easy to learn, difficult to master.
23:02
This game has a great amount, so much depth, but it is for my money, very accessible and and we have learned that there's a lot of folks out there who maybe don't go in for indie games generally are gravitating towards this.
I know that I was sitting in a ski lodge at a beautiful mountain in Montana arguing with Will over what dimension math problem this was.
23:25
And he was like, oh, it's a 2D math problem with more stuff.
And I was like, well, it's at least 3D.
But then he was like, well, it's it's it's ND depending on how many molts and how many polis you have.
And we're like like, ah, this is great.
I need to eat lunch and go back to skiing.
All right, so I I have I have a question for the the panel here.
23:45
This game, this game is compared a lot to other rogue style deck builders, your slaves, the Spires, your monsters, trains, and and so forth.
But those have a lot of ways to make your play much more deterministic.
24:06
And I get the sense that this game, because you you can only really see like like let's say the three rounds that you're playing, that's like as far as you can see in terms of strategy.
24:23
And my my question is like, should we have the ability in this game to mitigate more luck or randomness than there currently exists?
No, I see why.
No, I I see where you're going there.
24:39
It's it's interesting that there's no, there's like if you look at slightest fire or monster training, which I feel like are the most comparable games, you have the ability in some circumstances to hunt through your deck and pull certain things out and I can see where that would be.
24:57
That's definitely a temptation versus a game like this.
But I think that is like some of the other games we've played where that would ruin the conceit of the game.
Like you are still supposedly playing a heavily modified version of poker in this where you're drawing X amount of cards to build a hand.
25:19
And I think looking through the deck would be antithetical to that like Thesis.
Well, OK, well, what if it?
What if it's not quite so direct What because the the idea that I had because related to exactly this was that like yeah if you get like a bad shot that can be like it can be terrible and you it you might want to have the option to perhaps like re roll either an item or or all the items and not use the like essentially your your your in game currency and so and this and I and I say this from the perspective of the slate.
25:53
Aspire versus Bellantro when we look at like what's the penalty for just starting the game over and over again until you get optimal starting conditions.
Well Aspire they have NIAO which is gives you essentially more options.
It gives you up to four starting like 4 choices if you make it all the way to the first boss versus it only gives you the same two if you don't make it that far.
26:16
And so I would really like that it incentivizes you to like put an effort into every run.
Whereas in this game what I'm calling skipped tag or tag skipping is it, it's the only way to optimize your time And and in terms of like win wins per time played.
26:32
And I think that like if you installed this sort of like meta currency where a win or getting past a certain point allows you to do a certain reroll or allows you to do some other like slightly advantageous thing.
I think that that would really help a lot it with with regards to solving the the skip the tag.
26:50
Skipping.
Well, I mean, I mean more in the sense of like when you start a run of Bellatro you only see like small blind, big blind and the the boss ante.
Would this game be better if you could see like and that's like for one one round and there's 8 double rounds?
27:09
8 Ante's rounds are like actually like one, like a a small blind.
OK, sure.
Well, like that, that grouping, that grouping, that set of three, Would this game be better if you could see all of those sets out?
So you could be like, OK, these are the bosses I'm going to encounter along the way.
27:24
No, I I think it.
Would be better if I don't wanna do big bookkeeping right out the gate.
I think it'd be better if you could save one in advance, because then you could be like, well, if I buy this card now, I'm going to get screwed next round.
I think, I think.
27:40
It's good the way it is, I think that.
Because there are outs this.
This.
There are outs later if you have on if you've unlocked all the things.
I mean Scott, you know people are comparing this to other deck builders, which is a genre I had almost 0 experience in.
27:56
I think the A deck building game.
The deck building game that I have the most time in is the Pokémon Trading Card game for like.
Game with color.
Which I tried to save Scum and realized, Oh no, that's not going to work and that's not a rogue likes.
But anyway, people are comparing it to other, you know, deck builders because it's like this is this is a pretty unique game.
28:14
I mean realistically a more maybe clinical and like accurate term for this would be like rogue like poker.
But you know, yeah, it is, it is very different than those other deck builders And I think it would be, it wouldn't be much of A poker game if as you pointed out earlier in the day, Colin, if there wasn't that element of luck, it wouldn't really be that poker like.
28:41
So if you were like sifting through your deck and picking out cards, I think that might that might be a bridge too far for all we know.
Maybe the developer experimented with with something like that early on in development.
Possibly.
I mean there are effectively like ascension levels for your different deck.
28:58
So you can pick a different deck.
To say like, oh, this deck that I'm going to pick to start this run with gives me an extra discard or this one gives me more money or this one has some other kind of like trade-offs associated with it and you can increase the difficulty for those.
29:14
I guess if you were super Cuban and were able to beat one of these games that like, it feels to me like, OK, that's that's kind of like your Ascension or your heat level equivalent from either Slay the Spider or Hades where you're increasing the difficulty, be like, Oh yeah, I want a real challenge.
29:31
If for someone like I don't know what it is about this game, for me it feels like I'm already playing on like Ascension level 10 out of 20, just right out the gate.
It feels like there's there's like one or two kind of accessibility options that would be much more welcome at like an early intro stage that I could totally see.
29:51
Like, Yep, you turn that off on on like your next higher Ascension level, you turn this other accessibility thing off for another extension level.
It feels very like almost too punishing to me, and I might be the odd man out for this episode, but like, too punishing and too random.
30:12
So I went back to luck be a landlord, a game, which I thought was like the most random thing physically possible at the time.
I'm like, well, no, like this has this has like a lot of like really like understated but really solid synergies between like almost everything that you pick.
30:29
Whereas in this game, it's like it feels like, well, what Will was describing as like very run scummy.
Where Like unless I feel like I'm like absolutely going to, like punish this round and like blast it halfway through, I feel like there's no incentive for me to really try to experiment and hang on.
30:46
Have you ever tried getting good?
No.
Yeah, well that's a great question.
How does one get good at this game?
My my, the one suggestion I offered during our our offline conversation or off pod conversation was that this game maybe needs to give you more uncommon jokers.
31:05
Rarer jokers like earlier like as part of the meta progression like you unlock better jokers.
But felt like I wasn't encountering them very often and that definitely would have felt my win rate, I feel like.
I think that there should be a noob deck in in the the kindest way possible.
I think that there should be one deck that's like all of the the win conditions are halved and it's lets you like get some win, like understand how the progression works earlier and then you can get like some of those wins and then you're like all right here's the rest of the game because yeah, like it's quite difficult and we're all pretty smart people who do stats and and by all I mean three of us do stats and engineering and math and Andrew is also very smart, but doesn't do for the record.
31:56
I am a part time house husband, part time pizza delivery man, so you're very smart there.
Is and you have to no.
No, to be clear, I don't.
I don't do numbers for my.
But you don't do numbers for a living like we should be like Scott and I should be able to crush this game with our big brains.
32:13
I was doing the pen and paper.
I have the paper right here, audio listeners, the paper that has like the the numbers written down on like, OK, this is the run.
I'm going to write down all the numbers, I'm going to get all the multipliers going and it just it still didn't work somehow.
And Andrew, I know you don't do math for a living, but I know you are a smart person.
32:31
Like well, thank you I.
I just wanted to establish that there's a a a diversity in in backgrounds.
Well, also, D&D&D math is probably more complicated than this.
Don't.
Get me started on this.
Should be position design.
Yeah, I I could see this being like this.
32:47
This could have a barrier to entry for people who are like maybe.
Also, you didn't play poker in high school.
You didn't have that weird.
You didn't go to high school in the 2003 to 2007 highest of, like weird poker series time frame, so you didn't, You didn't learn how to, like, just intrinsically know what all the poker odds and poker hands are.
33:14
But also it's all.
Different here very.
Helpful to be clear in person.
Poker is bad.
This game is is not bad.
Sure, sure, this is much better than in person poker.
But like we like I, I I'm pretty sure we all went through that World Series of Poker days in high school where I did wear.
33:31
Sunglasses the whole time I was playing Bellatro.
Yeah, I I hear you and I I I did a teeny tiny bit of that.
I'd be at LAN parties and sometimes they'd be a little a little mini poker tournament, occasionally at our garage lands.
I don't think Gen.
33:46
Z.
Cares about poker as much as we did?
Perhaps not, but like I I I was thinking about that.
I'm like if if someone who has zero exposure to poker, like, is this game just not at all appealing?
Like how much do you do you have to have like at least a little bit like I'm.
34:03
I'm curious what this is like for players who are maybe from places where poker is less ubiquitous.
I have a little bit of like, oh, right inside straight draw, like, that's hard.
I probably shouldn't do that.
Like, that's something that I learned the hard way in high school, from, like, losing at poker to my friends.
34:23
Maybe that's why I'm so bad.
Like I feel like I I didn't really do any of that.
And like, I don't know, I kind of, like avoided high school, college poker like the plague.
And like, I don't even know what an inside straight is.
And Will's coming coming out with like, well, you gotta do like this, this and this.
34:38
It's like 343467.
So you need a a a middle card 'cause outside straight DA is like you can have a card on either side of to make the straight.
Why so many cards that can give you that?
34:54
Straight I I'll level with y'all I I I mean, I played poker when I was a kid and again, you know, occasionally at A at A at a LAN party or whatever.
I was as recently as, oh I don't know, like yesterday I had to click the little info button on the left to double check now which one's a flush and which one's a straight.
35:12
OK, got it.
Oh, is it just me and Will that played a lot of poker in high school?
Played a teeny bit, A teeny bit, but maybe this could be this could be the issue, Scott.
Potentially.
Well, the the game does have a lot of really good accessibility stuff like that.
35:30
Like if you have, if you're like me and you're just like poker and like you, you can never remember what the difference between a flush and straight is.
There's a lot of very helpful easy menus like oh, you just click through here and it shows you like, this is how it's calculated, here's like the cards that go into it, here's like the the bonus in multipliers and stuff.
35:50
And I think it's it's very good about like when you when you were selecting what stuff to play it says like hey this is a two pair, this is a another poker hand that that's among that list that everyone knows about and and it will tell you the math associated with that specific poker hand.
36:15
I think the one thing that I would add that I would I would be happy if this was removed on like a higher like ascension level difficulty is do the math for me please, oh oh.
No divisive take hot, take hot.
It's like, oh, when you hit.
That two you multiply and the.
36:31
Flame starts coming.
I cannot hot.
Take Why?
Why can't Because like you're I'm about to hit that submit button.
It's not like please.
Play the hand.
It's probabilistic.
But what does that even mean?
You can get a minimum and you can get a maximum range for sure, but you cannot get a value because many times the these jokers, they're not all like, Oh yeah, 100% chance to do this.
36:51
It's like, oh, there's a one in four chance to do something or like there's a one in two chance to to get a double molt when you play a heart, for instance.
That's the was it the bloodstone?
Not that I have all the cards and jokers.
Memorized so like but.
Many of the hands don't have that.
37:08
Many of them are deterministic and he can just be like, OK fine, I have to like sit down and calculate out.
Like is this three of a kind better than this two pair?
It's like, I mean, I don't know, they're both about the same.
For me, part of the thrill of the game, especially in later Ante's as you're getting closer to the potentially the end of the game, potentially victory was being like trying to play the game kind of by feel and maybe doing a little bit on the fly in my brain.
37:34
Math like approximate.
So it's kind of like, you know, but but sometimes I would be surprised like oh, I was sweating that hand and I totally blew the the, the, the, the money goal out of the water, the goal to goal as you guys said or.
37:51
Chips, chips.
And chips are separate.
You got chips and mold and score.
I didn't, I think.
It was like the chips, like the the final thing is chips, 'cause you're multiplying your initial chips by your your mold.
But but having to kind of guesstimate it I felt like was kind of thrilling and then like actually seeing and let's be clear folks, oh boy listen listen up folks.
38:11
The the the the graphics the sound design the effects happening as the as the as the cards are counted up and the multipliers are are added in and all the different synergies are activated.
It is, it is delightful and it like lights up.
I mean there's some great design going on here this the developer, whoever did the the the the graphics and the UI and all the feedback sound and and graphics, they might have a future in like Las Vegas slot design because.
38:40
Like.
This, this hold of your brain is just like, oh, this is, this is.
Very anti all of the things pulled up because like when you start the game it's at 1X speed and you're like this is fun and then you're like it's so slow.
I mean I'm I'm playing at 4X speed And then the things still like little feedback ticks still.
38:58
Hold up, it still works.
They still hit.
Yeah, it's good.
Scott, I think this could be an accessibility setting.
What you're describing it telling you before you play the hand, this is the range of how many points you will score.
It would, I think, cut down on some frustration because sometimes, you know, you realize after you've played the hand and lost like, Oh no, there was another hand available to me and I just didn't quite see it.
39:21
Yeah, I mean, and like juggling the math of like, OK, here's a card that's going to add 30 chips.
Juggalo, the math.
Yes, I'm glad that you're bringing up the Juggalo community.
I think this is going to be a hit with the ICP.
Crowd.
Well, I mean jokers and clowns.
Anyway, the you're you're adding.
39:40
So a a math calculation.
A typical math calculation in this game is you have a chip score that's like the let's let's say like A7 of hearts.
You get 7 chips for the seven on the card and you can have other things that are modifiers of that, like this gives you like plus 20 chips if like the Joker is upside down and the moon is in like a regressing lunar phase or something.
40:02
And I'm just like, OK, like, there's a lot of stuff to keep in my brain.
And then you have the difference between.
Additive multipliers and multiplicative multiplicative multipliers.
Well, what's the difference between pluses and multipliers in this game?
40:19
Pluses and multipliers.
What is a?
The the So you have your score, which is scored by the hand that you play.
So like you play four of a kind.
Hey, that's great.
You play just a single pair.
That's not so great.
No.
But it's and then that's multiplied by the multiplier score.
40:34
The multiplier score is determined by a bunch of other factors, but some cards add to that multiplier score.
Some multiply the multiplier score if I'm.
Matching the right.
Right.
I mean, this is all true and and the sequence matters heavily too.
40:49
Because multiplier is is better basically, which is something I have to be taught over discord.
This that is not OK.
Well I wanna clarify that right now.
The the the game, it the the the whole the way you beat this game is you or you you make your chips equal to your mult like if you're going to make it.
And I and I tried to point this out, but like if in order to maximize the square or the size of a a square or you could say a square or a cube or an N dimensional object, what you want to do is you're going to have the length of the width and all the other dimensional measurements be exactly the same.
41:18
Well, I mean, that's true if you were able to add equally to all of them, like plus 10 molds is better than plus 10 ships.
But is plus 100 ships better than plus 10 mold?
Like, that's going to depend on your various ratios.
Like that's what your spreadsheet needs to show.
It needs to show based off of your current expected chip count and your current expected molt count.
41:40
How much more chips do you need in order for chips to be better than molt?
See this again.
Folks.
Again.
Again.
And molt, of course, Auntie.
Blind when you're when you're talking to Auntie Blind to the next family gathering, you're trying to pitch Bellatro to her.
Just let her know.
Reminder what I said earlier.
41:55
Yeah, need to learn.
Difficult to master.
OK, I got I got the.
Size of an N dimensional.
Object, obviously.
Snooze fest.
All right, I've got another question for the group here, the great.
The game we're playing next week.
The great board game designer Reiner Knitzia has a famous quote that I think I'm my my mindset is.
42:17
What board games did he make?
He did Tigris and Euphrates.
OK, so good games.
Yeah, so I'll I'll accept his opinion as valid.
Yeah, and my mindset for this game has been to win.
Like that's my goal.
But I've always been feeling frustrated by bad luck of draws and things.
42:37
And Reiner Knitsia has this quote of, like, when when you're playing a game, the goal is to win, but it's not the goal that's important.
Or no, I've already watch it.
OK, we'll fix this in post.
Don't even worry.
About it?
Absolutely.
Reiner Knitsia has this quote.
When playing a game, the goal is to win, but it is the goal that's important, not the winning.
42:59
So I think a question that pivots off that is, what's the most fun part about this game that isn't winning a run?
The sound, I think.
Number go off the sound.
Did you guys sound posted?
I posted that that two-minute clip of me like getting to ante 13 I think.
43:17
And I had like a $5.5 billion like your billion score hand or whatever.
It's just like the the amount of like the dinging of like oh this thing is activating this thing is activating this thing and it's all going around and it's and it's getting faster and faster.
Yeah, the pitch is getting higher and the speed is increasing and you just get this.
43:34
This is a war.
That right there is Oh my God, that's a 10 out of 10 experience.
That's true, folks.
It's true.
I think it's the when you're like, there's no way I can possibly hit this.
And then you figure out like, wait, I can discard this stuff.
43:51
And then like, there's a one in four chance that if I draw the perfect card, I'll be able to get like 100 times more than I thought I was going to be able to get.
And you're like, cool.
I need, I need to hit 70,000 to make this.
And I have like 12 right now.
But I got that one weird card that I have.
44:06
It's like a one of thirty chance to get it and then it's just like, cool, Now my now my hand, instead of being worth 40,000 is worth 400,000 and you just crush it.
And that feels very good.
I I agree with both of you.
44:22
It is the decision making and then the visual and auditory feedback.
That's coupled with the success of like putting that that decision making into action and having made a good decision.
Now when you make a bad decision and the music slows down and the Game over screen pops up and you were feeling so good about the synergies you had going, oh boy, now that's that's not a good feeling or this game feels, and especially for me, it feels especially bad to lose in this game.
44:53
And that can be that can be bad.
Especially when you're looking at like 12 hours of of not getting a victory, starting to doubt your own abilities at Bellatro, knowing you got a podcast to record soon and you're thinking, Oh no, was my only.
45:10
Victory I ever got.
Just because I happened to get a good draw.
Was it all just luck?
Am IA failure?
AM IA fraud?
Am IA bilateral fraud?
I'm here to say no because I put it on four times speed with high contrast mode and I fired up that ace of spades on repeat and oh baby, Second wind felt too good.
45:26
Red screen, no way, Green screen.
And not only that, you were treated, folks, by a little piece of NES victory screen text.
The joker pops up and makes his little sound and then he gives you a customized.
Not customized, but a a a randomized victory message.
45:42
You aced it.
Oh boy.
Just a simple thing, it's it's not a very exciting victory screen, but because of the context of that victory screen and the experience leading up to it, it felt great.
It feels great to win when you finally get it.
45:59
Yeah, that's my point.
Yeah, losing is is tough, but playing the game is fun to play.
Yeah, it can feel bad to lose because you get the.
It means the same kind of thing with Poker Reel, like, well, I did the right move, but it didn't work out.
46:14
Like, cool, I am going to discard 4 cards three times in a row.
There's a 99% chance that I'm going to get this thing and somehow I didn't.
And you look back at your life, Oh well, it's because I'm trying to get diamonds and I've deleted all the diamonds out of my deck and you're like, I still should have, like statistically should have been able to get that.
46:34
It's like very frustrating.
But you know, that's the that thing you pay for.
Like, like I feel like all of the games that I loved best do have that they don't.
They don't kid you, They don't treat you like a child.
46:50
It does make victory hard to achieve.
And so when you get that victory, it feels satisfying because you know that you had to do both luck and skill and that feels good.
I.
I agree with all of this and I and I'll just add one more thing which is that in addition to these all these great sources of the feel good and you know in addition to the engaging like the loss of sense of time when you're in this game is one of those flow state sort of games.
47:19
They have this this.
The first time I got this I was like holy fuck there's no way because eventually you can duplicate cards you can start do all kinds of crazy stuff and you can get more than five of one card and and so at some point you play your first flush house or flush 5:00 and you're like Oh my like they don't even show you in the like the little menu that that that is possible.
47:39
But then you play five of the same card or of all the same suit and your and it just gives you this oh wow.
And then there's an upgrades available for that like.
Yeah, I do remember when I got the Tarot card for or the the planet card for Five of a Kind, I was like, oh, oh, this is delightful.
It's.
Special.
47:55
And it doesn't give you that until you've already played one, right?
That I think that little hidden delight is oh so nice, so nice.
Multiband.
There's a lot of great, yeah little subsystems that all like work together.
You were talking about the planet cards, which you can you can upgrade over the course of your run.
48:12
You can upgrade different types of hands.
So you can like upgrade your full house, upgrade your straight, upgrade your in this case as you said, 5/5 of a a kind, You can add different cards as we've already discussed.
You can modify cards with different types of of of effects and conditions, which some of them are stackable, some of their aren't.
48:31
There's there's a lot of like cool systems in hand.
Of course the the jokers are at sort of the heart of the design, but what was the question?
Sources of joy or this is I think the the before we get into the sources of pain and and then kind of the griping I do I like I I I want to make sure we get.
48:49
All of the areas of pleasures.
Yeah, What's?
What's good?
What's going on?
What do you like about it?
I think, I think an underrated.
Background great.
An underrated aspect of this game is it's nonviolent.
I feel like they're like, 'cause you're just, you're playing cards just for points and.
Although it is rated like illegal in Australia because it's gambling or something, they got their their like E for everyone license revoked because it's poker and even though there's no micro interactions and there's no actual gambling, they're like, well let's play with poker hands, so you must I made sure.
49:23
I made sure to buy the game during the period that it was.
It was banned from some marketplace.
That's gotta help out the dev, you know, and not that they need my help.
Did I read this correctly?
Half a million sales.
Something like that, yeah.
I mean, it doesn't surprise me, 'cause like, like we were saying, this game is, I guess, easy.
49:40
Yeah, it is easy to learn, very hard to master.
And there is that draw of, like, well, God damn it, I have to beat it this time.
And then you sit down and you're like, OK, I'm just gonna play for 20 minutes, and then 90 minutes goes past, you know, like, I don't know what just happened, but there's not a whole lot of games out there that are nonviolent in the sense that, like, there's not even any, like, monster killing of any kind.
50:05
Incorrect.
The ceremonial dagger actually kills jokers.
So wow.
Well, does it kill them?
Or does it simply send them to a a Joker farm upstate where they can cackle?
Well, I haven't seen that.
Card.
Well, it it destroys the joker to the right and then permanently adds double its cell value to the mold.
50:23
So I mean.
Come on guys, Destroy can mean many things.
Ceremonial Dagger Also slay the Spire card.
It looks like the thing that the silent uses definitely is.
It's not a silent card.
It's a That's a Gray card.
Yeah, it's a Gray card that gets plus one for every something that you kill or something like that.
50:40
But goofs aside, you are right.
Scott and I just like our previous game.
Think.
That's admirable and interesting and novel in a good way.
But there's not some kind of like this isn't wrapped in some kind of weird theme like oh you're you're playing in a high stakes game of poker where you're you're gonna get devoured by the master Joker or some you know kind of it clown situation like Nope, it's just it is you're playing playing for chips and playing for fun or or sometimes playing you know for the respect of your Co host.
51:12
Well, and and the you.
Gotta get a second win before before recording time and boy oh boy did I do it and it was great.
The yeah, I think we we Andrew, you mentioned it briefly the high contrast mode as an accessibility option.
Good call Will when Will's got the Pro strats and that's one of them High contrast mode.
51:31
That way you can easily see the difference between every suit.
Every suit has its own distinct color.
Instead of accidentally playing a a black splay, a black spade and a black club at the same time, thinking, aha, I've got my full house here.
Oh no, I've lost again because I for.
51:47
Real quick, I think.
You need flush there by the way that that was.
Really embarrassing.
Maybe maybe we need to think about, you know, doing like a Patreon Episode bonus episode on this that doesn't exist.
I'm just kidding on on troubleshooting Scott's issues with this game.
What sort of strategies, if any, were you going for?
52:04
Because there are ways again, as you as you're as you're playing the game you're going of the rounds.
You can try to collect a you can you can you can invest heavily in like in in planet cards and try to upgrade your deck.
You can invest heavily in buying booster packs and adding like you know, throw a shit load of aces into your into your deck.
52:22
For example, you can invest heavily in finding jokers.
You know that all synergize in some way, and when I say invest heavily you can invest somewhat.
Unfortunately the game doesn't give you an opportunity to like really go all in on one of those elements, but like and and what sort of hands were you playing?
52:38
What was like your go to hand?
From my All right, I'll I'll start with the bad the bad strategy 1st and then Will can correct my my bad play as he's done many times and he's been right 100% of the time.
So I fully admit that.
Like there's something that's eluding me here, but it seems like for the early strategies you're always playing flushes, SO5 cards of the same suit to like get lots of bonuses and like clear clear stuff out building building up an economy of money.
53:06
So that way you accrue interest off of that and you use that interest to buy stuff from the shop.
But as far as I can tell, it seems like the the big power play from this game comes from the jokers and synergies between the jokers.
53:21
And if you don't get that synergy, then restart the run.
And it's not guaranteed that you're going to get a synergy every time.
Sure.
And there's, I mean there's also there's there's finding the synergy between the jokers, but there's also like you know trying to early in the early in the run you have to kind of play to the jokers you have and and that that's an important factor as well.
53:45
So it's it's it's kind of a yeah, I guess it's a a combination.
So a lot of flushes, eh?
Well I mean there's a there's a there's a landscape of possibilities here where and I what I mean by that is that you can go you can you can essentially have no jokers and and just if you just got the planet cards and put all your money into planet cards for instance that is up up until a certain point viable.
54:07
And if you found the the the synergies between the planet cards that you're getting and the up like up upgrades in your deck.
So for instance if you're if you to take flush as an example although I I think that I mean I think it is one of the better hands that you can get.
But like as an example if you got increased hand size as like one of the things that you're going for for vouchers and you and you a pair of that with like removing the wrong cards and changing them all over to one color or into two suits which is more ideal at least early on that we can do just alternate between them like yeah you don't have to have good jokers at all Jokers obviously help with the whole mix of things like eventually you do need to have everything working together but you can synergize in very strongly in One Direction or another up until anti four or five.
54:50
You don't really need to have like you know all you know that your all your jokers working perfect synergies Although I will I will say I think that Joker's and and getting that filled out quickly with any joker is usually a good idea.
55:05
But there's a lot of if we want to talk like full on strategy, that's a whole other like long conversation I guess to be ahead of it, don't get me wrong, but like you.
Know it's gonna be a money.
And investing and like you know.
The bonus app that that definitely is real available on Band Camp, yeah.
55:21
I guess I brought it up.
Not not totally just to you know, put you on blast, but also just as I guess, I guess the point is that there are some opportunities for strategy.
I think in my experience those tools for strategy were sometimes maybe it could be a little more power.
55:40
I guess it would have been nice if like maybe the game gives you a little more money, maybe the maybe the booster card decks give you a few more cards.
Because yeah, I felt, I felt like with a lot of my runs, I was gonna.
I was having to tap dance and improvise as opposed to like going in with a plan and seeing that plan through generally.
56:01
Speaking and that's, and that's fine.
But like, I feel like the times that I've done that where being flexible is totally, you know, a viable thing.
But like if you're like OK, this boss blind coming up is going to nullify all of my spade cards and I've been doing a really spade heavy build.
56:22
I have two rounds to to figure out a way to mitigate that before that boss is coming for me.
That feels too close.
I feel like I need more breathing time before that cause, like you, you could have some tag options like you skip, you skip a gameplay round to get some kind of bonus or benefit.
56:41
There could be some trade-offs there that could help out.
But it seems like more often than not in my experience, that you're you're greeted with a boss blind.
You're like, well, I don't have the reroll and I don't have the $10 to pay for it, so I'm boned.
Yeah.
There there are three outs, which is that that skip tag that reroll the boss.
57:00
There's the voucher which allows you to reroll for 10.
The cost of 10.
And then there is the the the joker which you can sell during the the the, but like the probability within the essentially 2 shops that you have before the boss in order to to try and mitigate that if you have no offence is low and which is which is how the game is trying to teach you that you can't go all.
57:22
Basically put all your.
Eggs in yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
But, but but I will say that like that in general is better And so like much of the like some of the game, yeah.
One of the problems you might say with the game is that like yeah, if you if you specialize in a way that would win 9 times out of 10 like eventually like you will sometimes get that boss that is just the counter to you.
57:44
And like that's the idea.
This is the like a a core point of good games I think though is to have boss archetypes which challenge your deck or your build archetypes and so that's why all of them are like I think they're brilliantly done.
I think that the that that all works really well with the the escalation from small to big to the you know the archetype challenge.
58:05
But like, yeah, they they there's not a lot of opportunities to to fix it.
If you're on the 8th, 1:00 and you're like you have 100% hearts and you're doing all flushes and it's all hearts are are are are debuffed, Yeah, you're fucked.
There's just no way around it.
And you just, you know, I don't know, the losses don't hurt as much, I guess, perhaps.
58:23
What I'm bringing up is a negative is, is actually, you know, very intentional and very good.
The fact that you can't, you can't go 100% in on one of these strategies and I guess that's that's probably good, 'cause, yeah, the one in 10, you know, boss, they run into a total.
58:40
Oh, you're saying you should.
Oh, OK.
Take the loss.
You know, take.
The rest you're gonna win.
Exciting.
I see what you're saying that.
That's why I was saying before like you know there's a there's a difference between you can see one boss ahead and you can see the entire shape of the board for the rest of the game.
Like I think you could see if you could see what the next blind was, the next boss blind was like even one single round earlier.
59:06
I think that would help because it won't show you like, so you beat the you beat the boss round ante one and you go into the shop and you're like looking at the stuff and you're like, I want to see what the run is happening and it shows you the run that you just beat the the the ante that you just beat If it showed even just there so you get one more shop, I think that would make it.
59:27
I mean, you'd have three shops instead of two.
I think that would make it a better game because it's very frustrating.
You're like, cool this, this, this what's going on in my run button gives you no additional information when you click it at the end of your.
At the end of the ante, I found that would be pretty annoying.
59:43
Interesting.
Interesting.
Now this I'm I think maybe raises a good question.
The fact that, OK, so well you're suggesting hey go go for the 9 out of 10, you know that that that that risk if you have a good deck, if it works 9 out of 10 times, it's a pretty good deck and it's worth running the risk of maybe running into that one out of 10.
1:00:02
That's a a bad match.
That's OK because hey, the runs don't take that long.
What do we at least in my estimation, what do we think about the runtime Rogue, like games are all about runs.
Is this a good length?
A bad length, Etcetera.
1:00:17
Etcetera question.
Good length.
Perfect length.
It's.
It's.
I think it mere, I mean to to pay homage to Slay Aspire.
It's about essentially the same amount of time as far as I can tell.
There you go.
Which is to say, I didn't time it.
Well, I feel like even up.
To one hour I would say or depending on how many calculations you want to do or how like try hard you want to be.
1:00:37
Because like even if you're like.
I'm glad you.
Agree Will that.
Enter the Gungeon has the perfect runtime, perfect run length.
I think even if you're getting like pounded over the head repeatedly, like restarting a run is like almost instantaneous and like like and then you know like, OK, like I've I've experienced this thing that I didn't experience before.
1:01:00
Got it.
I'm ready to go in with this new kind of strategy to try something different this time.
And it's it has that fast fail loop to it really, really buttoned down very well I think.
Yeah, you can get into a next run extremely quickly.
1:01:17
It's like 2 button clicks.
And and that's, I mean that I think that's a a good segue as long as we're griping about some of these things too.
Griping.
Let the griping commence.
It's it's almost it's too efficient and I and I brought this up earlier about how like Yep you can you can just do the this tag skipping which it just for because I made this term up and I'll I'll go and just explain here in the in the very beginning you can see the like 2 tags which are essentially you have the option to either take a fight or you know do the do the do a round or do a skip.
1:01:49
And most of the time in the game like it's it's it's probably about like 75% of the time it's better to take the the battle.
And like there's you know everything kind of like grows together.
Like there's there are many things that benefit from actually taking fights.
But skips in some cases are super beneficial and they do things like give you 2 like Arcana things and like or or reroll the boss.
1:02:07
And so like you might want to skip.
And so in the very beginning, once you get beyond the first level of stakes because there's like the kind of we're talking about stakes.
Stakes like the the ascension levels, once you get beyond the first one, like you don't get like any extra money for the first small blind for instance.
And so as you're, you have less incentive to take it.
1:02:25
The point I'm making here is that like eventually, like, you just want to make sure that like your your runs start off well because like the odds get so stacked against you that like you could play full run or like just go to you and naturally fail and do every single one.
But the amount of time you put into that failure where you're going to fail in like Andy two or three is like, Oh my God.
1:02:43
It's just really frustrating when you can just sit there, hit escape, new run, escape new run, escape new run.
Do that over and over again until you see one holographic.
And then potentially if you want to get super like, you know, you know, do a holographic plus a voucher, a free voucher or free items in your next shop.
1:03:00
If you get that combination right there that means you you roll, you skip the first two.
You go right into the boss where you have about a 70% win rate if used by optimal strategy which I'll release later this year for a hefty fee.
But if you use that but like then you're you're leaving that 70% chance with like essentially something that will carry you through the 1st 3 Ante's.
1:03:17
And because the the 10 + 10 moult you get from a hollow and plus all the money you're saving all the other items you're getting Oh my God it just puts you in a really nice position.
Is that a good game mechanic though?
Where what the is optimal for your time is to hit escape new run, escape new run, escape new run until you see a combination of skip tags that you like.
1:03:37
I would say no, but because Colin has boxed us into the conceit of yes, there has to be randomness then I think that's baked into that system.
But I don't think that's.
I think that's anti randomness because you don't.
Actually I I like.
I'm not very.
Political.
1:03:52
But I am anti randomness.
No, I love randomness as we've.
Seen because you're you're you're immediately destroying the randomness and getting certainty through escape methods.
So like literally escape.
Yeah escape and restart.
Like I I know that like Will and I have different philosophies on Rimworld where Will will do the Prepare Carefully mod where he gets like he can a little around and have like the perfect starting scenario.
1:04:19
And I'm a big fan of just like I roll and I just go with like the first three people that it gives me and I'm like well we'll see if we die and I'll turn down the difficulties so that it like works out doing that.
And so like just continuously re rolling until we have the perfect starting setup feels very bad to me and I I haven't done it even though I know it's optimal.
1:04:41
I'll just play whatever it gives me because unless it's like really stupid and I immediately lose.
But like, yeah, I don't like that at all.
It feels like it's not the game.
Well, I have to do it though.
Sure.
I mean, I I because I must be in the top .1% who gets all of the collection as fast as possible.
1:05:02
I I'm sorry, it has no.
No, it's fine for you to do it at the higher once.
You're like I'm trying to get to the the like the most the the the the goal taking of stakes.
Yeah.
I think the I think tag.
Skipping is probably not optimal.
1:05:19
The the fact that that's, you know, a good strategy, the fact that that's like needed is maybe not the best game design.
However, once you're at the point of doing tag skipping like you are part of you're a serious Palatra player.
1:05:36
I think the average person who spent 15 bucks and has gotten like 10 hours of of good entertainment out of it, they're not gonna be tag skipping.
They've already got they're calling it.
Balatro by that point.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
So it's maybe not the best this that's maybe not ideal from a design perspective, but I mean this is this is kind of you know an outlier case like the this is this is not the the typical average player off the streets experience.
1:06:05
So I I think it's maybe fine.
I think tag skipping the fact that it exists and is necessary is fine so long as not every player is doing it.
And yeah, that's that's I guess I.
Don't know what's not the worst.
It's fine.
The highest difficulty that you've beaten so far Have you beaten on all difficulties?
1:06:24
I've beaten them all and I I have all decks up to the black level difficulty.
I'm kind of going through them and then I have the the checkered deck which I think is a STR along with the plasma deck but potentially the erratic decks and and so on.
But like, I have that one to be up to gold stakes and I'm right now my my goal is to get them all up to gold.
1:06:41
Which means yeah, just going through it and.
How do?
How do I get?
How do I get good?
Well, I've got a a Lesson plan is 1010 sessions.
And they're a. $100 a session, Paid in advance, of course.
Are there?
Any tags to.
Can I sacrifice a Joker to pay that cost?
1:06:58
I.
Mean like I mean, I I I am more than happy to you know join you for like I I I really enjoyed our little coaching session.
But, you know, sorry, coaching.
Session Well so I guess like the the real question is do I need to study poker hands?
Do I need to do like statistics of poker, like education outside of this game in order to like you know, beat, beat like the base difficulty on like two or three decks?
1:07:26
Like if that's my goal, Like how how invested into like poker shenanigans do I need to get?
Not at all.
I I think that see the great thing about the this game and and games like it is that the meta progression makes it easier over time.
Like you started with net like no jokers unlocked.
Like, yeah, eventually, like if you just like get that more jokers unlocked, then most of them are more powerful, then on average you're going to have a better jokers presented to you.
1:07:53
On average, you'll be able to progress.
And so you don't actually have to have an intense R scripts giving you the exact percent chance of you getting that three of a kind versus the potential for, you know, the the flush that you're going for after 2 draw.
1:08:08
You know, there's a lot of, I mean the math behind this gets really fun by the way.
I mean it's I really excited.
My, my, the, the the binobil just like Oh my God, I I just got really pulled into all the math again.
But you don't need to get into the math.
You can, I think, safely play this game by feel, which I'm a big proponent of.
1:08:28
Before we continue on saying good things about this game, I do want to air my my other major right.
We were on cons, which is.
A thing that feels very bad, which is you can upgrade the poker hands and each one is discreet.
1:08:45
So you can upgrade like pair three of a kind, two pair, full house.
And that often means that a better in quotes hand scores you less points.
So it's like oh I've upgraded 2 pair by a lot and full house by nothing.
1:09:01
So it is better for me to play 2 twos and two threes rather than the two twos and three threes that I have.
And that feels bad.
I don't like it.
Well, I mean, like that depends on the strategy though, right, Like and like all the jokers that you have to kind of facilitate that 'cause I mean, but.
1:09:19
It can, but you can if you can just you purely can upgrade the hands.
And also there have been other times where it's like I can't play this hand because it's technically a flush, but I want it to play as the other thing.
Like I was play the I actually, I won this run, but it was the one that you have the joker that merges all the black cards and all the red cards into two separate suits.
1:09:44
And I'm like great cool, I have this great thing And then but I had also been really like upgrading pairs and stuff.
By the time I saw that I was like, OK, I could either completely switch my strategies and or sell this card because I can't really do both because I can't make two pair anymore.
1:10:03
I had like all of these weird things about flushes and stuff that I'd like randomly picked up.
And I'm like, well, now I I like.
I wanna switch into that because it's definitely a better strategy, but the way it won't let you pick stuff quite as as smoothly as I want it to.
1:10:20
Like inflexible builds.
Around.
I feel used to it.
Right.
You get used to it.
I I think the one time that for me, I lost a run because I had all my flushes upgraded.
But straight flush not at all.
And so I'm just like, oh, here's 5 red cards or whatever clicked all of them.
All right.
I'm sure I got this one wrapped up in the bag.
And then I look and I said, oh straight, oh, I played a oh, oh, oh.
1:10:39
I had no upgrades for that.
And then I lost.
And so it's like, oh, now every single.
Time game design.
I just look over be able to switch which hand it is playing.
I think it's like.
Mechanic you got to learn.
Well, I I can see it.
I think it's a bad.
Mechanic sure I can learn it cause bad.
1:10:56
I I I agree with you Colin.
It's yeah, as we all know in Rogue as as we generally agree feel bad deaths in Rogue likes feel bad and that type is like is is especially bad I.
There's a certain there's a certain element of of like of cohort, of like lawyers who would really love this game because of how strict the verbiage is in some senses, of like, Nope, sorry, you played this thing and it's this thing, not this other thing.
1:11:26
And like, yeah, that other thing is inclusive of this thing, but you didn't play this thing specifically it.
Contains a pair.
Knots is a pair.
Right, right.
It comes down to the the age-old like RPG.
You know, discussion like rules is written versus you know, the spirit of the rules, and I tend to agree sort of the spirit of the rule would be one would hope that Bellatro would look at the cards you're playing and go, OK, technically this meets 2 satisfies 2 specifications.
1:11:57
Like, let's take the one that's worth the most points in the interest of player fun.
Rule of recording the player for having like you know.
Either auto takes the one that's the most fun or at least like, or give you a button where you can like click through and be like no, I actually just wanna play a pair here.
Right, 'cause there's there are situations where you would want to play a sub optimal hand to like trigger something in the game.
1:12:16
Yeah, that is.
That is a possibility.
That's true.
And then on higher, on higher ascension levels, take that option away.
Sure.
No, that's so.
That's even worse.
I suspect given this game's absolute, you know, just incredible popularity, I I think we're probably going to see some, some significant content updates.
1:12:39
I wouldn't be surprised to see like some, some, some, yeah, some modes, some accessibility modes, some sort of, you know, more friendly modes for more casual players or, you know, people who don't necessarily want to bust out, you know, Google Sheets and all that jazz.
I could definitely picture like there being some kind of a storyline mode.
1:12:59
Like, I don't, I don't think that's impossible, but I guess we'll see.
Or maybe I'll just keep it the way it is because the developer I'm sure is probably excited to, you know, take take the synergy and maybe roll into another project.
Who knows?
Yeah I feel like this game is is primed for mod support and like user created jokers and like user created different types of decks.
1:13:22
I think like this game is just it's it's resonated so well with people because I think of how unique and flexible this play space is.
And I think like the developer was saying that like he's not done with with all like the different kind of things to explore in like the gameplay mechanics also, which doesn't.
1:13:42
It doesn't shock me because it feels to me like the the compare like I I booted up luck be a landlord again just to kind of compare like pure random casino simulators and see how like how the differences there are.
And it felt to me like landlord had and landlord's been out for a lot longer.
1:14:00
So obviously, but it felt like it had a lot more like interwoven synergies between things.
And it feels like, Oh yeah, if, yeah, if you give this game like another year and like have a lot more time for like thoughtful jokers or modifications or strategies to evolve and there's like some interesting like synergy that is built up that's more common.
1:14:27
Or like that synergy building happens more frequently instead of just like I didn't get anything this time, fuck me then I feel like, yeah, like it's it's totally primed for that.
This game definitely I think needs a lock or like I like pay $1.00 to lock this option for the next store.
1:14:44
Instead of just.
Like yeah, yeah, that would be good.
There's one thing, other thing that I want in high school we played a lot of it's got a gazillion names, president, asshole, whatever.
And we played a weird modified version of it.
1:15:00
But we had certain extra hands that you could play.
I want the double straight, which is like 223344 and that's like a weird card that it's like, OK, I want more card hands that are not in standard poker, like if you get seven cards in a row you should be able to play that or something.
1:15:23
I don't know, like there's there's some things where like I I like it.
It only lets you play 5 cards, but I think it'd be fun if there were certain things that you could play that were more than five cards.
It's like a super hand.
Super.
Hand the dead.
Band challenges again.
What?
What is the term you used for that, Colin?
1:15:39
Because I thought this was just a house rule that, like my sisters and I had growing.
Up.
We called them bombs in.
Bombs, President.
Asshole is dropping the bomb OK?
You can play it at any point during the game and you would just way around immediately.
Interesting.
It didn't even be your.
1:15:54
Turn Yeah, I think this game has a bright future ahead of it, even even brighter than things are going right now, if you can believe it.
Were you saying well?
Well, I I, I mean there there isn't exactly that in the challenge modes, but have you, any of you done any of the challenges?
1:16:10
No, no.
This game is enough of a challenge.
There's so much good content in there.
Holy shit.
All right, well, you guys have to try it out at some point.
They're basically.
Like I literally didn't even know there was challenge mode because I just am clicking get into game as fast as possible whenever starting it.
The the basic premise is that it just starts you towards the center a synergy.
1:16:28
It's just not.
It doesn't count.
You can't unlock things or do anything with a meta progression.
It's just like purely in the challenges, but like it it'll give you like the the the card, which is like a no face card sort of a thing and the and the joker that like a couple of jokers that synergize with no face cards.
1:16:45
And so it'll just kind of start you on your way and then like and you know, obviously you try and balance that with some other negative modifiers, but like they're really fun as far as I can tell.
I mean I've only played a couple so far 'cause my I've got to get gold stakes on all my, my, my, my, my, my things.
But like that's I'm looking forward to doing that after and I think it's potentially a lot of fun.
1:17:04
We're having some ratings.
On I think we're Speaking of fun.
How fun this was.
Wow, we we talked about math and cards for a long time.
Yeah, I'll go.
I'll go first.
I'll kick us off our ratings.
I was waffling on this because, like, yeah, I think like the new, the new player experience.
1:17:26
When you sit down, you're just exploring the game.
You're like, oh, this is a lot of fun.
Oh, OK, I lost.
All right, let's try another one.
Oh, I lost.
OK, let's let's try another one.
Well, I got really close that time, but I lost.
Oh, but I made that one silly decision.
But let's retry it again.
And then like, 10 hours later, you're still losing and losing and losing.
1:17:43
There's some, there's some switch that hasn't flipped in my brain yet.
I think I'm getting there.
And so I originally wanted to give this a spite score of putting it just below Monster Train.
No, because I thought, like, well, Monster Train does all the math for me.
1:18:01
The Monster train's aesthetic is quite objectionable for me.
I like this game's aesthetic much, much, much, much, much more.
Just 'cause it.
There's every everything about like the like the little movement of the text on the screen, the weird lava lamp in the background, the like a of like the numbers.
1:18:22
Like even if I'm getting pounded like that stuff still activates the like the lizard part of my reward center of my brain.
So instead of like just below Monster Train, I'm gonna put it just ahead of Monster Train as maybe like a reverse spite score.
That is still like borderline like mutiny level.
1:18:41
I'm sorry, this is this is your I'm I I'm so glad that.
You Well, 'cause I think there's a lot of things.
I think there's a lot of things with this game that that could use more accessibility for.
Well, I don't know.
Like, again, I think like, maybe I'm too focused on the goal of winning, Maybe I should try those challenges, maybe I should try exploring other things.
1:19:02
But I've never in this game played a royal flush before.
There's been no incentive for me to do so.
I've and like there's there's got to be something there, but maybe it's just I haven't spent 150 hours like testing every little thing in this game.
1:19:18
But it's it's good.
It's very, very good.
I think people should check it out.
I don't know if it's better than some of these top games on my list as of yet, but we'll see how more content things roll out with it.
I imagine like when we like this, this is probably guaranteed to show up in our Omega Bowl finals for the for the year when we were visit there.
1:19:41
It'll probably be like addressing all of my gripes about it.
So for me it's an an 8 out of 10.
You put tome ahead of this, therefore your opinion is completely invalid.
I mean Tome has been out for what like 10 plus years, So if Bellatro 10 plus years from now is?
1:19:59
There's nothing it needs.
It doesn't actually need anything else.
It's a finished game.
Like if they do anything else to it, like great, like, But it is.
It's done.
It's balanced, it's fun, There's there.
Like, maybe you can add more mechanics to get little doodads here and there, but I think you're I think you're crazy too random.
1:20:15
I think, I think you just got to get good.
I think that's the.
Main.
I think if you had a win on your belt.
No, don't want to.
Give you the 10 out of 10, I think the win would give you 2 + 2 points.
I opened the floodgates to this by by interrupting.
Apologies, Scott.
This is rankings time, and the time is is yours to do with, as you will, but 8 out of 10 is still incredibly good.
1:20:34
High score, high score.
Hey Andrew, Harshman here.
I'm going to say I also had a very tough time ranking this 'cause it feels it's so different from other games.
It's like, I mean a lot of people, a lot of, you know, baby boomers love solitaire and I don't like solitaire.
1:20:53
I don't like playing solitaire on on PC or whatever.
But I think this is is kind of similar and it's like how do you how do you rank how do you how do you compare solitaire to I don't know story driven game where some big AAA title or some like really delightful you know quirky indie side scroller but but I did anyway I looked at my list and at first I thought you know the biggest downfall of this game and the at first I thought it's gonna score low on my ranking because there's it's devoid of story and but then I started looking at some games and I'm like you know nightmare Reaper, bad story Wilder myth you're making your own story and I guess I wasn't feeling very creative So in my experience that would be great but there were some games where it's like well these games are already getting a zero for almost a zero for story for me.
1:21:49
So I may as well rank this pretty high.
Dead Cells not my favorite in terms of story.
Bottom line is I thought that I thought no story was gonna be its downfall.
Turned out to to while comparing it directly to other games on my list.
It ended up kind of being a non issue and it is my new number 5 coming in at #5 which puts it right above well well way way way ahead of Monster Train.
1:22:15
Monster is not even on my list.
But anyway, putting it ahead of just just barely.
Rim world.
Sorry to sorry to do it to you there, Will.
Head of Rimworld, Head of Dead Cells had a Nightmare Reaper and just behind Binding of Isaac.
1:22:31
But what's the?
What's the score then?
I'm looking at the sheet here and I'm.
Oh, did I not fill it out?
I'm a little confused.
Boom, boom, boom.
One second.
Oh well, I'll, I'll fill it in later.
Anyway, it's.
I suppose it would have to be.
A.
You're ruining your statistics.
1:22:46
Ham True.
Boom.
I thought I filled this out earlier.
Weird.
Anyway, I think I I think I got it.
I think I got it.
So behind Rimworld.
Whoops, Nope.
That's wrong.
Wait, what is this sheet that I'm looking at?
Is this my?
Am I on the right page?
I'm filling in the wrong area?
I see I.
1:23:01
Give it filled it with a bunch of useless histogram charts.
I gave it a 7 point 97.9 in order to get it to for my ranking sheet.
It doesn't matter.
This is boring.
It's #5 that's that's what matters.
The order.
It's #5 game.
1:23:17
I think it's great and I'm looking forward to, and I've been just exposing.
I've been, I've been evangelizing, I should say, on behalf of this game for the last two weeks.
Very enjoyable, but very hard.
I'll go next.
I gave it a 9.5, so I I put it.
1:23:34
I put a 9.5 point something something something so that it hit my #2 game slightly above.
Dead Cells is a better 9.5 game than Dead Cells.
It's not a it's not a 10 point O.
There's still some stuff in it that I it's not it's not a perfect game, but it's pretty darn good.
1:23:53
I will say that it could get up to maybe.
I mean I'm I'm only doing it in .5 scales but could get up to 9.6 if I had a mobile version.
I was on a flight for many hours on Saturday and you guys were on Discord talking about it and I was like, this game needs, absolutely needs a mobile version.
1:24:15
Well, if you had a Switch or a Steam deck like me, you'd be cripplingly addicted to opening it up every 30 seconds and.
Trying to have a phone, because I do, you can just play it on that phone Infinity style or whatever it was.
I would be shocked if this game is not on mobile by the end of the year.
1:24:32
Oh yeah, I mean.
At the end of the week.
There, there, there are definitely plans to have it on mobile.
It's just 22 days old, so there you go.
There's nothing on it that it might play better on mobile in some ways.
You just tap at it and then click go.
1:24:49
So yeah, very good game.
It needs more than one song.
Maybe, but it's so good though.
It is a good song, yeah.
I mean, most of my criticism are pretty, pretty shallow.
It was extremely addictive and I'm going to go play it immediately after this, even though we're going to have a new game to play instead.
1:25:10
Well I'm feeling that too but just bravo.
Beautiful score.
The exact same score in fact that I I gave it here 9.5 out of 10.
I know I I I alluded to a potential 10 out of 10 game but you know when I thinking about the what what the fines are 10 out of 10 it has to like it really needs to define as genre.
1:25:32
I think in order to be a 10 out of 10 for me, it needs to.
Be the, the, the.
Top of the the the the the biggest mountain in in the mountain range in order to really get that title.
So and I think State Aspire is better it's I think I think that I I can really appreciate the differences with this game and I and I think it of all the other Rogue Light deck builders this is the most fun except for slate Aspire and so yeah Monster train didn't yeah it it just did not even not even close to this one so 9.5 I I don't know what changes that could make it better.
1:26:12
I think it's really great the way it is except for fixing things like the the tag skipping.
I think that I don't.
I don't want to sit here for 5 minutes and hit escape new run over and over again and I I feel like I have to if I want to optimize for this.
1:26:28
So I could obviously just not do that and then lose more.
But I can't.
I can't be bothered.
I cannot be losing more.
It has to wins only.
So I love that it got my my As soon as I start writing code and and doing a deep analysis about something like this, I know I'm having a good time.
1:26:46
So yeah, 9.5 out of 10 and I am equally looking forward to getting off this.
I'm going to smoke a bowl here and jump into my my bed computer and play some Bellantro.
Which, so I'm sorry, importantly, maybe maybe you mentioned this.
1:27:04
Where does it?
How does it stack up against luck?
Be a landlord?
Actually, yeah.
So.
I mean for will specifically, which one?
Sounds like luck be a landlord has been dethroned.
Well, Lucky Land Award was a nine, was a nine out of 10.
Oh my word.
1:27:19
Wow.
Rimworld Rimworld defined a genre and it's a 10 out of 10.
Lucky Land award nine.
I think this game is better than that but it's it's a lot of similar sort of flow states in synergy building sort of things.
Omega Bowl, watch out here comes.
1:27:35
Bilatro.
Bilatro, as you said earlier, Scott.
Indeed.
Well, I think that's gonna put it roughly at our new #4 game on our overall list out of some 42 games that we played.
So, so kudos to Balatro Balatro, Balatro for for that one.
1:27:58
I I really should have played dead cells so that I could give it a lower rank that way it.
Wouldn't be sitting up there so high.
That that NA value there is really throwing things.
Off See This is why we got to auto sort by.
Media If you go play 2 Hours of Dead Cells, we'll let you put a ranking in there.
It's too late that that ship is that ship I I.
1:28:16
Think it might have sailed?
Just to just to have the opportunity to move it down, not that I would you know, I'll give it the the score it deserves, but all right, well.
And that's that's going to wind down our Blotro episode.
If you want to write in with your gambling stories from Las Vegas, you can send those into grogpodzone@gmail.com.
1:28:39
Our Mastodon is Grogpod at game dev dot place and we'll post Will's shenanigans with with stats and everything in the show notes, Grogpod, dot Zone, or wherever you get your podcasts.
Check the description and should be in there.
I'll figure out a way to put in there.
1:28:57
Colin, what's are we?
Are we travelling back in time for our next episode for a future episode?
Is that what happened?
Into the breach?
Yes, Time travel.
Colin, what's our next game that we're playing?
It's another head scratcher.
1:29:13
It's into the breach where apparently you travel in time, which I didn't know even though I played the game well.
Robots.
Robots fighting each other, I think.
Bug Zords or something.
I think you're in for.
You're in for quite a treat if you have not played a whole bunch of that game.
1:29:31
Zero.
I beat it one time and then I was like, cool and I should play it more.
And then I didn't, because I was on the podcast and I needed to play other games.
It's like, what if Pacific Rim had time travel?
What more do you need in a video game?
Oh, chess, you need chess tactics.
That's what you need.
This Omega Bowl is going to be insane if.
1:29:48
We got into.
The breach, Bellatro.
Oh my God.
If we had downfall in there too, which I'm, you know, hoping to get on my next pick, it's going to be real tough.
Yeah, we'll we'll have to see the, the playoff tournament of of Rolex in December.
1:30:04
Stay tuned.
It's going to be a bloodbath for sure.
Yeah, Into the breach.
Woo.
It's going to be going to be a doozy.
Well, that's going to do it for this, for this episode.
And as you can probably tell from that background music, it's it's time to play us out.
And you know, you know that I'm.
1:30:22
I'm born to lose in this game of Bellagio.
And gambling is for fools.
But that's the way I like it, baby.
I don't want to live forever.
And don't forget the Joker.
