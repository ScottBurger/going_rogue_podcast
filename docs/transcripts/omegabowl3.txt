None.
Through 48 weeks, 12 games have emerged from the Grog Pod rankings process, battling for supremacy for our rating systems to represent the best what the rogue genre has to offer in the strongest showing yet.
0:43
From traditional roguelikes on this program emerges a slate of some of the best recent releases, ranging from Rift Wizard to the Hugo Award-winning Caves of Cud. 2025 also gave us unique spins on the genre, from the slow, enigmatic puzzler Blueprints to the electrifying pace of Elden Ring Night Rain.
1:04
From surprise hidden gems like Spirit Fall to one of the most popular games on Steam with the also Hugo award-winning Hades.
We gather to revisit our thoughts, experiment, experiences and listener letters for our end of season recap tournament.
1:22
They have been rated.
You have been I rated.
And now we determine who takes home the trophy of Yandor this year in our playoff style elimination bracket of the best with Omega Bowl 3.
1:53
Hello from around the world from Grog Pod Stadium.
I am your overpaid talking bobblehead commentator, host of the podcast Scott Berger and sliding into the commentary booth with me are my fellow Co hosts.
Hello, it's Colin, your judge.
2:11
Hey, go ahead, go ahead.
We're already arguing the episode hasn't even started.
The designated Gatorade dumper.
It's me, Andrew Harshman.
And this is a will write the voice of reason.
Well, we are joined with our Co host, but we're also joined with listeners from a slate of of whole bunch of new countries that have tuned in this year to listen to specifically to Collin's voice as he loves hearing about this kind of stuff.
2:40
We say Ola to to new listeners from Brazil.
We say alo to new listeners from Norway, a Salamu to believe it or not, listeners in Kenya.
We have a well, we'll say LOI Chao Bombay to our maybe.
2:58
We shouldn't.
To our listeners, most likely just Robert from Vietnam and Slava, Ukraine to our listeners out in the Ukraine, welcome to the the final episode of our of our Season 3 of the podcast.
3:17
And we'll be we'll be doing the usual here.
We'll be diving into listener letters that we've gotten in response to all some of our episodes that we've made it to here.
And and actually, I'll I'll kick us off with a couple here because there's we got one right in from Relds Rey from our last Omega Bowl episode, who who wrote in to say last year.
3:41
Thank you, Scott, Will, Colin and Andrew for yet another exciting round of Omega Bowl.
And of course, revisiting seasons 2's roguish picks.
There were a lot of strong, especially on the light side contenders.
A bit sad personally at the lack of Sheeran but the grog pog community has spoken.
3:58
I'm honestly a bit surprised at how high Vampire survivors ranked.
I highly underestimated the value of quote brain dead comfort play and thought it would be against the rogue like spirit to to list it as a positive, what with, as far as I can tell, the genres controversial emphasis on creating a tense, grind free and challenging experience.
4:18
To each their own I suppose.
Handshake emoji?
I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on Rogue Lakes in season 3.
There's still lots of gems to uncover.
Little yellow BLOB man making a thumbs up emoji.
Yeah I think.
Well, faithful listener, welcome to your own hall of torment, because you might get another one of those this year.
4:37
Rels Ray, Thank you for writing in.
And you're right, we're frauds.
We Vampire Survivors should not have been that high.
What the?
Right, OK, this is APG No, it's not I that that's just not that's just not true.
That's a great game.
I eat this.
4:52
I don't know who this person is, but I was.
Like, wait, what won last year?
Oh, right, Slay the Spire, of course.
Well, we also Woody, frequent guest on the show, wrote us to say pass along my congratulations to Andrew for sticking with Spelunky and making it happen for victory.
5:12
Even though Spelunky didn't make it on on the the the final bracket here for some might say obvious reasons, I think Woody wanted to extend his congratulations nonetheless.
Thank you Woody.
I I couldn't have done it without you.
I want to thank the Academy and I want to thank Woody and also thank the very convenient feature of right click, uninstall and Steam.
5:37
It's so easy to get that game out of my library and out of my life and while.
Sadly, Cube Chaos also did not make the Omega Bowl this year.
We did get a comment from a grooving gamer who said I.
5:53
I listened to your Tales of Majal review recently and was worried that the podcast would have stopped in the intervening time.
So glad you have continued all this time.
And now I really want to check out Cube Chaos.
Let's see if my mind is strong enough.
What a wild game.
Ruben Gamer, thank you so much for for your sharing your surprise.
6:14
I'm also equally as surprised that the show's still going.
I kid, of course.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You let us know what you think.
Of that the only way Scott lets us out of our gaming dungeon.
He lets us see the light so we can record this podcast and he ships us back down there.
Well, this year is once again like every Omega Bowl stack.
6:35
It's chock full of high quality games where none of these are a bad game.
And when we vote them to send them pack in, it's it's not out of malice, it's not out of spite.
It's just wasn't wasn't their year this year.
6:51
No, it's out of malice, in spite for me.
Just I'm gonna say that in advance, but go ahead.
Yeah, we have our division winners.
We have our second overall of the podcast ranked Kay's of CUD.
We have third overall, Hades, 11th, Noita, 13th, Blueprints, 15th, Elden Ring, Night Rain, and 22nd The King is watching.
7:13
Rounding out kind of our overall categories that we've listed our games by and rounding out the rest of the the bracket are our wildcards with Halls of Torment, Spirit Fall, Path of Accra, Dead Zone, Rogue Heroes Hour and Rift Wizard.
7:32
Yeah, this'll this'll be kind of like the standard format.
You know, you're listening to this, you've listened to all of the previous Omega bowls.
You're tuning in for all the Omega Bowl commercials that are popping off.
Yeah.
So you know how this goes is our.
Sponsor.
We are sponsored by Rogue Kings or.
7:54
Absolutely.
But just as a refresher, because I know I needed a refresher.
Basically we're going to we're going to have two games are going to enter the Omega Arena.
We are going to discuss, we're going to debate which is better.
And then we are going to vote and well, there's four people on the podcast.
8:13
So what are we going to do, Scott, if we have a tie?
Well, if we have a tie, it goes to you, the listeners who have ranked with your feet and your downloads and given us a, a, a way to determine who the the fan favorite is for each of these match ups.
8:32
And should it come down to A22 split or other kinds of splits as we might encounter, we'll toss it to the listeners and see what other kind of nonsense awaits us as we trudge through, trudge through the trenches, as it were.
8:48
So yeah, I think what we'll kick off here with our very first wild card entry into the tournament with Halls of Torment, our number 12 overall game of the podcast versus our number 36 overall game of the podcast, Rift Wizard.
9:07
Well, this is this is our inaugural match, eh?
We just talked about halls of torment and here we are talking about it again.
How exciting.
Well, to express my feelings on these matchups, I've put together a few zingers, if you will.
9:26
Give me a moment here.
Halls of Torment.
More like Halls of Torment.
Game's only 6 bucks, but you're better off pirating it.
It's not even worth the $6, am I right fellas?
Right.
Really.
Rift Wizard?
I think they should have called it Sniff.
9:43
You liked Halls of Torment?
Though it stinks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I'm trying to be, you know, fair and impartial at.
Least initially, No see, you're that's the wrong approach, where judge, jury, executioner, the game that loses is executed and no mercy, no, no feeling.
10:05
Well, let me let me kick off some listener comments here.
So we got a message.
We got a message from this person who writes in to say I hope the moon for halls of torment and and we thank you rectal spatula for sending that in as compared with lefty Spurlock who says love you podcast.
10:29
BTW, exclamation mark.
Wow, it's nice to hear from Spatula City.
Thank you.
And it's good to hear from, I don't know, the left coast from our our other listener there.
Thank you for writing in.
Well, let's see who remember the visuals.
10:48
Obviously I I played a little bit of RIP Wizard over the past few days just to kind of refresh my memory on it.
And you know, we have pack of Path of Acura on this list as well, a very kind of similar style game.
And I, I kept feeling every time I was again, I was playing Rift Wizard immediately after Path of Acura over the past week or so.
11:10
And I kept thinking to myself, man, I really wish I was just playing Path of Acura.
Oh no no no no.
Path of Acura barely has a purple robed protagonist.
The clear winner is wait, Riff Wizard versus Halls of Torment?
11:26
Look, we got it.
It comes down to the visuals and obviously Riff Wizard wins.
No, I think everyone, everyone knows is Halls of Torment.
There's no, there's no competition here.
I don't even know why we're having any discussion whatsoever.
Halls of Torment, genuine fun game.
11:43
Everyone should play it.
Riff Wizard is, turns out, traditional roguelikes.
I'm good.
Rift Wizard isn't even a traditional roguelike, it's just a great fun game.
I liked rift wizard better than halls of torment.
I have it rated higher.
Wait on what?
11:58
Yes surprising what?
I have rift wizard.
I I rift wizard is pretty high up in my rankings.
He's #12 for me I gave him 8.5.
I really liked Rift Wizard I think.
A A a point in favor for Rift Wizard is that I feel like the final boss battle with Mordred is I still I still.
12:18
Super cool.
Yeah, I still think about that a lot of like, man, I wish more games kind of had like this crazy like the universe is collapsing around you, like fight to the death with this other like super powered wizard that like you're both at that point.
So like OP, I wish more, more games had that, but I think like my, my ramp with rift wizard was like trying to get over the hill of like the little generators that spawned the units.
12:47
And well, I mean, we'll be talking about path backer in a minute, but that it felt like, man, I got to deal with the with the little things.
And I guess also like the the UI just feels a little Spartan for me, whereas Halls of Torment feels just like the complete package.
13:03
Again, we're kind of like comparing a little bit of apples and oranges with like a solo dev game made in pie game versus.
Doesn't matter.
You can't, we can't, we can't think of a effort that's gone into these we're we're judging the purely as consumed items here.
So.
13:20
I'm curious will cause you've you've been playing a little bit more of Halls of Torment since our last episode of it.
What?
What has continued to suck you in afterwards?
Honestly, you look at that, the list of things to do of unlocks and whatnot, and you target 1 and then you try and get it.
13:40
And that's just a satisfying loop.
And doesn't matter if you're trying to, I don't know, like kill a certain number of things or go into an area with a certain piece of equipment or like the Arcane Rift and do 2000 or kill 2000 creatures with full HP in the frozen blah blah.
13:59
That's it's fun and it's my, it is to, to be fair to the first person who wrote in about Vampire Survivors, it is mindless fun.
And often times, to be honest, I'm half my screen is doing something else and I'm just like barely paying attention.
14:15
But it's just a, it's a, it's good.
It's a little dopamine hit constantly.
It's a, it's a, it's a fun game.
I mean, I won't deny it.
It's a, it's a good game.
I just, I liked Riff Wizard a lot.
I thought it had some really good like like it is truly the opposite.
14:33
It is 100% beard scratch like pondering like build synergy optimizers.
Which is why I'm shocked that you didn't like it.
You'd think I'd like that you would because that's absolutely my style, but the the sparseness of it and how a Spartan as.
14:48
I feel like you didn't actually play it.
No, I put five hours in.
I put 90 hours.
All right, all right, all right.
I.
Just looked it up.
Yeah, no, it's I, I, I played the game.
I wanted to like it but there just was not enough of a hook for me.
I just, the whole fucking grid based nonsense is not my thing.
15:08
I can't get perfection.
It's we got a data scientist here who hates grids.
Well, well, matrices wants to just be a pure.
List of numbers.
All right.
Well I'm hearing 11 strong yes for for halls of Torment.
15:24
I think I'm going to put my vote behind Halls of Torment also.
I think I thought we.
Could.
And I think Rift Wizard is, is very good for what it is.
I think like interestingly, I feel like rift Wizard 2 might be more of a hook to Will.
15:40
And if we, if we get to it at some point in the future, like it's, it's slightly different enough.
Like it doesn't solve like Will's problems of like, oh, it looks very Spartan, blah, blah.
But I think that like I thought it was.
There's.
Honestly, you think Riff Wizard 2 is worse?
Yeah, I didn't enjoy it as much.
15:56
Well, that's, that's another kind of interesting thing is like there are there are people who really like 2, there are people who really like 1.
And I feel like I kind of fall in the middle between the two.
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.
I didn't think it was bad.
I just was like, Oh no, it's missing some some essential element from the first one.
16:14
I don't remember what that is because I don't remember that well, but I remember thinking that.
All right that the Hall of Torment is opening.
In this case it is the voting booths.
This is the the voting center.
I am officially casting my vote for Rift Wizard.
16:30
It always is on my mind every time I rank a game.
It's like, is this better than Rift Wizard?
Is it worse than Rift Wizard?
And.
And you've mentioned that game since we played it, that.
Was not.
He talks about purple Wizards all the time.
OK, I brought it up last episode about the bar of whether a game can can surpass a game.
16:49
That's fair.
I threw that out there thinking I might be right and I'm thinking I might not get challenged.
But then.
I I admire your Hutzpah and you know, hey, there's no need to go back and like check to see like what actual ranking I gave both of these games.
17:06
Oh, wait a minute.
Let's let's look at that.
I why I'm on a different computer?
I can't access it so I'm not sure but I ripped wizard I think is doing something more.
I mean, you definitely didn't like with Wizard as much as you liked Hell's the Tournament because I am on a computer where I'm looking at the rankings.
17:24
But This is why this, you know, This is why I would play the game.
You know, you could win in the regular season, but playoffs?
Playoffs.
This is 1 V 1.
Oh yeah, combat. 6.4 versus 8.0 is how you 8 that's and then and you're telling me 6.4 is the winner, that's what you're.
17:40
Doing I've had a lot of personal growth since then and I think the one V1 matchup is is a different a different beast entirely and anyway, so yeah, again, listeners don't don't look at my numbers or anything yeah rift wizard Colin, have you been have you been swayed?
18:00
I'm rifting.
Yeah, OK, well, why?
Are you throwing this out to the people?
The people they don't know?
What?
They're talking.
The people will.
Vote with you will.
I I sincerely hope so, but I, I don't know, I've been let down in the past.
Andrew and Colin are only doing this to demonstrate the listener vote and the power behind it and and what it it entails.
18:22
So.
Yeah, I guess the point me.
Here we go.
With with A22 split, we're going to the listeners here and I'm looking at my Google Sheet with all the cells blacked out here.
So I know what the top 2 are.
But in a case like this where it's like somewhere in the middle, like I don't know.
18:40
And so now I'm gonna I'm gonna hit the filter thing to rank the just the two that I have selected here.
This this is also great material for an audio podcast where people are like, oh boy, I can't wait to visualize spreadsheets and then.
These are these rogue like players do it every day and.
18:56
To be clear, listener, we also aren't looking at this spreadsheet.
So we're in just as much expense as as as you are.
Only Scott knows.
Halls of Torment Riff Wizard sorting by the listener overall rank and the winner is Halls of Torment.
19:13
Thank God, voice of reason, whoever.
How did that work by the way?
Is that just like how many people was the sample?
To get into the nitty gritty.
Deep and secret formula I'm.
I'm happy with the results, so let's not challenge it.
Yeah, Scott.
Summoned it from the essence he's.
We don't want.
19:28
We don't.
Want to spell the?
Magic please.
The long and the short of it is that numbers go in, number comes out, and we're all satisfied as a result.
Garbage go in, pure truth come out.
As the old adage says, well, well, Rift Wizard, thank you for playing.
19:45
It was.
That was what our second game that we played for this season.
I think overall it was really early.
What a high note.
Yeah, but making it all all being able to combat all of the other games, often making it even just making it to the Omega Bowl is something to be praiseworthy.
20:04
So as we.
Push it out of the stadium and revoke its press pass.
What?
What door prize are we going to give to Riff Wizard on his way out?
Here the award for best purple robe.
Yeah, like we give it.
Yeah, we give it the purple robe.
20:20
The purple robe of a first out.
OK.
Well, that's going to move us to our next match up here in the wild Card round with our 15th overall ranked Elden Ring Night Rain versus our 34th overall ranked game, Heroes Hour.
20:39
These couple of good games and of course I kid, I kid.
These are all great games, of course, but I mean, you know, we we joke we joke with those that we love and and about the media that we love.
Hey Elden Ring night rain.
There's about as much excitement in this Elden Ring game as there is in a elderly home Come on, folks.
20:59
And the drops are probably better now.
I didn't.
Actually play the.
Other game here, so you know the hero's hour, but so I'm going to of course do the the the honorable thing and recuse myself from this.
21:14
That being said, Hero.
'S hour.
You're recused.
You are recused.
Get out of here, but I just need to tell you real quick you.
Know.
Well, you know, you're just setting you.
You should be you should be encouraging him to stay in this so that you, the president, doesn't get set the.
President doesn't matter though, as soon as I start speaking over everyone, right?
21:32
That's how that works.
He who has loudest voice?
But you know, I didn't actually play this game so I don't know a whole lot about it, so maybe I don't have this quite right, but well, you know, I think Euro Hour would be better.
Come on, give me a sandwich, you know?
And no no by the way, a sandwich shop that's more of a rogue like experience than in the so-called 4X game. 4X more like I couldn't give 4 fucks about.
21:56
This.
And I think obviously we'll be voting for Eldering.
I feel like Andrew spent all all of all of the three minutes before the show putting prepping his zingers in in deep writing here.
22:11
But but I I feel like this letter or message here from Drunken Vike kind of sums up Heroes Hour a little bit here for you Andrew, where he says it's a super interesting game but the onboarding is absolutely terrible and I have a hard time telling why battles turn out the way they do.
22:30
As far as Heroes of Might and Magic inspired games, A Song of Conquest is my favorite derivative.
But if you haven't played the classics, Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and three are phenomenal. 5 is pretty good.
Also this one here from frequent letter writer Inner Deviant Fuchsa, whose name I'm always going to pronounce wrong every time, says for Heroes Hour specifically.
22:50
Pretty sure we may have fallen outside of the realm of roguelikes with this one.
Not that there hasn't been roguelike style games based off 4X formulas, but this one didn't seem to be attempting to be a roguelike, just taking some inspiration from them.
Upon the mention of the tutorial, I'm now remembering that I actually did play this game.
23:07
Must be mixing it up with something else.
That's strong endorsement.
I remember that that tutorial I had a real rough time with and I don't think I even got out of the first area.
So again, probably not very qualified to to review it.
23:22
So thank you, first listener and Damien Fuchsa, always great to hear from you.
Is it Damien or Daniel?
Davian, Davian.
Fuchsa F Just F yeah, it's well, I mean, there's some randomization in this game.
23:38
There's, there's like random heroes or something, right?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, actually the game that it's going up against here with Elden Ring night ring, there's like some like disturbing parallels here where in in like the early game for heroes hour, you're kind of doing this like route optimization puzzle of like, oh, I need to go from here to here and from here to here and from here to here and maybe doing some like field fights along the way.
24:03
Not unlike Belden ring night rain, which I have played a little bit since since our coverage of it.
And I mean, just dropping right back in felt like a, like a nice weathered like leather glove.
24:20
Oh, it just fits so well.
It's just like, it's just the fact that we have like an, A, an AI don't know if you would call this a AAA, maybe like a AA plus rogue style game from the Elden Ring universe.
24:36
And it being like even remotely fun is just like such a slam dunk.
I think when we were talking about it at the time, we weren't quite sure what like the the DLC was.
And so that has actually come out just maybe like a week ago or so.
But I think we were talking about this mode called depth of night, which is it's kind of like a challenge mode for sickos where you're just like, oh boy, I can't wait to try to like tackle this exponentially more difficult like difficulty modifier system.
25:06
That's not the DLC.
The DLC is kind of getting dragged a bit on steam because even though it's sold 2 million copies in two days, it I think people were expecting a lot more variety out of it as opposed to just I mean, there's like there's two new characters, two more bosses.
25:24
There's like a new map, sure, but I think because of just how much shit there is in bass Elden Ring, you kind of have the expectation of like, well, if I'm buying ADLC, that's like almost half the price of the base game.
How much more stuff from Eldon Ring are we gonna get?
25:40
And if it like I think I made the comment when we first played it of like this feels like the smash 64 version of of like perfect smash.
And this feels like the Smash 64 version of whatever, like the perfect From Soft, the universe, like colliding, like all the Dark Souls stuff, all of like the Armored Core stuff all jammed into one like unholy, like morass.
26:09
Like there's something out there in the far future that exists like that.
I don't think this game is it yet.
I'm happy that it exists.
I'm a big fan of it, but it as like it.
It is clearly a first attempt at this, but I think even if it is a first attempt, it's still pretty good.
26:25
I mean I.
Thought the the like the weird Co-op battle Royale monster mash up formula seems pretty darn intriguing.
Like I don't I mean maybe there are other games out there, but I've not played a battle Royale like the the zone is closing type game where it wasn't just a big battle Royale.
26:46
It's kind of surprising to me that there hasn't been anything like that.
So I, I liked, I liked that.
I mean, I remember just the one time that when we played and that guy really, really, we, we found the guy who basically just carried us through and he really wanted me to get some sword or something from outside.
27:02
And he just kept being like, no, we have to go further into the, into the death, missed the fire on the outside.
I'm just like, I can't go there, please no, don't make me.
But then he did make me and then I got the thing and I was, and then he beat the game for us.
27:18
Well this this comment from science bitch 962 I think kind of echoes your sentiment where he says it.
Elden ring, night ring it's it's my comfort game now.
It fixed 2 problems for me.
One don't have to deal with toxic PvP and online shooter games and two having comrades on the way to epic boss fights instead of being alone in traditional souls games he says.
27:40
That being said, that that being said, but I hope future updates will bring a bigger map, more complex dungeons and things to explore, slash fight, which yeah, I think like rogue games content is king.
And there's a lot of stuff in this game and you know, you can kind of see it all in 40 or 50 hours and maybe that's fine.
28:00
But there is like a version like it's such a good idea and there's like an idea of this that exists.
That's like all of the stuff from all of the Fromsoft games that maybe it'll work, I don't know, But there's like a Smash Ultimate version of this out there in the far future that I'm very excited to play.
28:16
Well, thank you for writing in bitchin science or what have you PhD bitchin.
Wait, yeah, You know, interestingly there's been, you know, this this idea of calling upon the, you know, the spirits and the the helpful people to assist you, you know, with boss fights that's been in front top games for so long.
28:39
So having to be the sort of a multiplayer mode seems like sort of a fulfillment of a theme that's been in these games for so long.
I generally agree with your take on it, Scott.
It's good.
28:55
But oh boy, when we get that Super Smash Melee or whatever people think the best Melee is, that's going to be super sweet.
Yeah.
And it's competitor here is our I feel like I remember having fun the first time I played it.
When we played it again for this podcast, I didn't enjoy it and I remember the flaws of it very quickly.
29:15
The route optimization mini game in the beginning, not great, yes.
Do you?
And this.
And thus ends my critique of Heroes Hour.
I guess like maybe how do you like the the root optimization puzzle that you do in Elden Ring Night Rain as as opposed to Heroes Hour?
29:41
I mean, I feel like that's it's that one's fine because it's not the whole game.
Like really the first, what 50% of Heroes hour is just of each run in Heroes hour is just like, what is the like, what is the correct order in which to unlock these things?
30:01
It doesn't feel like A and yeah, I know we'll, we'll talk about all of those army composition stuff and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
But maybe I just didn't, I did not engage with that as much.
I don't have good like intro music though.
Not where where it's just a oh, here's a can you hit the button at the right time game.
30:20
Oh yeah, that's fun.
I hit the button when I need to hit the button.
Oh, good.
I won because I hit the button in the right millisecond.
Yes, well, but sometimes when you're hitting that button, you are just bashing your teammates, your incapacitated teammates until they met deeply heal, which is delightful.
30:39
That's that's a teammates innovative mechanic.
I agree.
But I know I'm, I know I'm defeated here, but Heroes Hour I was more engaging to me than the the boring generic smack a thing until it dies, learn its pattern.
30:57
Blah blah blah blah blah.
I mean, I'll say that.
I didn't write.
I don't think it's going to change.
Like either of these games?
Blasphemy.
There we go, sinful, sinful and but at least we we have some scholars of that are the wild.
31:12
Card for a reason.
Scholars, you say?
Well, I mean, it was it was up in the in the actual main playoff bracket, but some of our other games that came in late like it, it just bumped it right off and down into the wild card.
But but yeah, I think well, I'm I'm definitely casting my strong yes for Eldon Ring night rain.
31:33
I'm getting a similar vibe from others possibly.
Correct.
Yes.
I'm.
Also that's.
Right.
Well, I vote I.
Mean, I didn't say it.
I did say I was recusing myself.
Well, but then you unrecuse yourself when you remembered you had played the game.
31:49
I suppose.
Well, even with me being recused, it sounds like it's 2:00 to 1:00.
Yeah, don't worry, it'll get, it'll get crossed in the next round.
I I.
Haven't looked ahead that far.
I'll just wait until you hear my one liner.
Well, yeah, so if if Elden Ring night rain moves ahead to the next round, what what prize are we going to bestow upon our hero?
32:18
For heroes our here as the as the the the waves of enemies come crashing in.
I seem to call the game having some some.
Cool spells and loot?
Well, what's the best item you could give a give a hero?
I have no idea.
32:35
There's so many because there's so much variety in this game.
Oh, I love them.
All what you're getting is 1000 red Dragons.
That's.
What I'm having and some some.
That, that is a good door prize all.
Right, that Heroes hour does not have to go home empty handed. 1000 dragon crowns or whatever red Dragons.
32:54
Thank you.
That's.
The That's the powerful.
One wait, what if it was 60?
What if it was 60?
You had a power hour of red Dragons.
There we go.
One dragon per minute per hour.
Handsome Handsome award.
All right, well, Wild Card Group 3 is going to be our number 19 overall and our #1 hidden gem game of the 2025 season, as dictated by some math I won't care to explain here.
33:22
Spirit Fall versus our 32 overall ranked rising from the ashes dead zone rogue out of the tribes universe yeah and I think I'll I'll kick this one off with a a write in from about dead zone rogue from SQL gene who says I'm enjoying the episode.
33:44
Really surprised to learn the history about dead zone rogue.
We have one from How do I pronounce this Pantheon who says I picked it up as my friend and I are looking for some new stuff to play so I appreciate the review.
And one from Donkey Brain hero who says Dead zone Rogue is fantastic.
34:02
I've done every mission on hard, but the expert and nightmare modes are sweaty as hell.
And before we jump into spirit fall here, I'll read off this one.
This is the longest letter of the night, but I did time it that I can get this in under I think 90 seconds.
So I'll see how fast I can read this and still have it be legible here.
34:21
But they did include a link which I will dump in the chat for people to look at while I read this one off.
This was also one that I promised to read off earlier in the season.
I'm like, no, it's way too long.
And then I'm like, oh, it would fit perfectly here, so.
34:36
What am I looking at in this link?
This is a list of 260 Rogue games that Mister MO 1984 has written in with their rankings and says who wrote into our e-mail.
It says hello Grogpod Zonies.
34:52
I was searching for a roguelike podcast since I mainly play roguelikes and rogue lights and thankfully I found yours.
First of all, I have to tell you I'm happy to know that there are others who love rogues as much as I do.
Because of my gaming environment, there aren't many people enjoying them like me.
For sure no one played as many as I did.
35:08
Only listen to 1 full episode so far and chose Spirit Fall first because it was on my Steam wish list and now moved to my PlayStation wish list since I mainly play on there.
I enjoyed listening to you very much and we'll definitely listen to more from the past and all to come if the games hit my interests.
35:24
I just started playing Streets of Rogue or I just started the Streets of Rogue episode and no wonder.
I'm still the only persons I know who really love the game.
Getting all the trophies for the platinum was was great fun playing Co-op.
I remember having fun with the comedian telling jokes to NPCS and having the ones who laughed following everything that I do with them.
35:42
Unfortunately my buddies were not as good as you.
I think referring to us on the podcast here seemingly are at those games and we got our first win after many tries before I grinded my way through on my own.
I really like your ranking lists and have given you a link to my Google doc tier list with the 260 rogues I've played so far.
35:59
I should add the game category to mine too.
A few recommendations besides the S tier games and lists are * evaders which is a must play and one that will give you lots of discuss.
Astral Ascent with a deep and broad meta progression as well As for A2 game mini episode, mimic logic and dungeon divers.
36:17
I was more addicted to dungeon divers than Bilatro, but so far I didn't meet anyone who shares my love for that game.
But I have high hopes in at least one of you :) I close with my top five games.
Looking forward to all you do in the future #5 Battle brothers #4 Darkest dungeon #3 Dead cells #2 Sorry, will slay the Spire #1 enter the Gungeon.
36:42
Hey, who?
Who's this person?
Greetings from Germany, this is.
Mr. MO, how dare.
I feel like he does voice.
He did get a pretty good cross section of games that we.
Like 200 roguelikes.
Wow, incredible.
And I'm off to 200.
Of course.
36:58
My man loves the distinguished gentleman.
A man of taste and substance loves into the gungeon.
What a deal.
What a deal.
Well, thank you so much for listening.
And yeah, you got to try.
You got to do the ape out Strat you know when you're playing Streets of Rogue is my understanding.
37:15
Yeah, quad apes.
I think we did Triple apes and one.
Was fun.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Wow, wow, wow.
It's outstanding.
And of course, thank you also for writing in SQL Gene, Pantheon and Donkey Brain Hero.
37:30
Was it that?
Yeah, good memory.
Sounds like a better.
Well, yeah, memory sounds like a better game than Hero's Hour, that's for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, hey, you know.
Speaking of the games, we're oh, right, right, so spirit.
Fall and dead zone rogue anyway.
37:46
Spirit fall.
Yeah, I think slop fall.
Spirit fail, I think is more like it.
You know, Hey, I've seen better production value in a Neil Breen film.
The spirit fall.
I tell you, I kid.
Of course I kid.
Spirit fall.
38:01
I I played it all the way through to completion.
Or at least like a basic, you know, the basic set of.
I think you need to get 5 successful runs to get the core thing.
The core.
The core story you got the true.
Ending to that game well.
38:17
I assume there's something like beyond that, but like, you know, the bare bones like victory.
And it was a lot of fun.
It was a lot of fun.
I think one of something that really stuck out to me was the interesting things that the game did with the with the classic tried and true staple of rogue gaming, which of course is the sleigh the Spire map and Spirit Fall does some interesting things with that.
38:45
You have a enemy boss that moves around on the map.
There are like new pathways that open up and I found myself doing more beard scratching on that map than I usually do with with similar map layouts.
Plus the combat's pretty good and I really I'm on the record as as being bad at Smash games and not liking them as a result, but enjoying Spirit Fall quite a lot.
39:13
That being said, I mean, you can't go up against dead zone.
Come on.
Dead Zone Rogue, the game which I have to keep looking up what game it is because I cannot remember it.
Well, when your name, when the name of the game is the only complaint, the only actual complaint.
39:31
No, no.
I.
Can't remember the game.
At first I at first I can't remember what game it was at all and then I can't remember what happened in the game.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my goodness.
Great.
Well, you make the decision to to nuke the space station or not.
And the and the and we.
We haven't.
No, I didn't get that very far.
39:47
OK.
Well, let me remind you, this is the game where classically, we got sidetracked by this ridiculous argument about how y'all didn't like the AI.
It wasn't sophisticated enough.
Ridiculous.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I still don't like that.
Unfortunately, if you shoot a gun in the room next to you, you can hear it.
40:05
Robots don't have ears, so.
Even though so far so so far we've started hearing some some mediocre discussion of dead zone, I seem to recall they all not being crazy about spirit fall either.
40:21
So maybe dead.
Zone.
Win by default.
I like spirit fall I felt like the boss fights in spirit fall were the worst part of it just cuz the first boss fight is just so I don't know it feels kind of like bland the.
Levels are super boring.
The levels are boring.
40:36
I did I did like playing the game and like getting getting like the unlocks.
It's the only game that I've played where like I can actually wave dash and not feel like a complete goon while doing it.
And like the game is like built entirely around that stuff.
40:51
And when you get like really good, cool combos and like the all the synergies between the different generic animal spirits going like it feels really good to play.
I think it, it kind of looks a little generic and feels a little generic, but like, you know, if you're stuck on a on a plane for 8 hours and like, you're just like, I guess I'll play some more spirit fall because I have a podcast and I have to do it for homework.
41:13
You're like, you know, actually this is pretty banging.
And I feel like the first I, I was glad Andrew, that you picked the dead zone rogue because I bounced off of it so hard from I think like the Steam Nextfest demo or something.
I played like 20 minutes.
I'm like, what is this?
41:29
Just like a whole bunch of like hallway fights with like boring boxes and stuff.
And I think Colin, you made the the comment that there's like all of the Star Wars Roger Roger robots in it.
And I was like, man, is this gonna be the whole game?
And I'm glad that it it wasn't.
And it got better and more complicated.
41:46
Some of the boss fights in Dead Zone Rogue were also similarly like frustrating and dumb that I thought were like, well in one case like fighting the cloned CEO I thought was.
The Folk CEO, Yeah.
I didn't think that was funny and I thought that the the the boss fight were like the guy was just kind of standing in the center and was like shooting stuff around was was pretty lame, but the final boss fight was OK.
42:11
Generally I think like dead zone rogue guy had fun.
I had fun with both these games for different reasons, but I.
Felt like yeah, Dead Zone rogue was just kind of mindless.
I I feel like both of them actually were a little bit generic in their theming, but spirit Fall is not generic in its genre.
42:35
Like it's the only game that I can think of that is like that.
Like a weird Smash Bros rogue like game versus there are many rogue like rogue light shooters.
Yeah, I mean, how many of them are very good though?
42:53
I mean, come on.
I mean, isn't Dead Cells kind of like Spirit Fall?
I should have played another beat them up.
No, not at all.
It was it was a smash like game.
Spiritual.
Yeah, yeah, Spirit follows basically like Super Smash Bros, but like single player, you're running through and getting single.
43:10
I mean I hate 2D side scrollers so I I immediately filter this out of the things I would.
Do yeah, you were dumb for doing that.
I.
Mean I've got, I've got.
No, I've got no dog in this fight.
I don't.
Did you?
Play either of these games.
Yeah, no, I played Dead Zone Rogue and I don't like that game and.
43:30
Spirit.
Fall, I would say.
I'm going to give Spirit Fall the benefit of the doubt.
Just because it's.
Smash like.
Oh, I forgot though I meant to ask you on the Dead Zone episode as our resident weapon expert will, do you think we will like in the Dead Zone sci-fi future?
43:51
Ever have digital ammunition readouts?
No, indeed, No, I mean, right.
I mean, like there's such a benefit in having a, an analog system where you remember how many shots you fired.
It's you drop a mag when you can.
44:08
It's not a matter of like, doesn't matter.
Yeah, it's I I don't think that.
I don't think that's a big factor.
What about gun?
What about gun shooting giant ice orbs?
Oh yeah.
Ice Yeah, What about electric bullets?
I would, it's just one last argument for for dead zone.
44:25
I always called it the wrong thing.
Dead fall, say like night zone or something.
Zone 1.
Last thing for dead zone rogue I would I would argue that the perks the perk systems better boring, more exciting than spirit fall.
44:45
They're.
They're just like, wrong.
Make your grenade better.
OK, sure.
It did feel kind of, I mean it was like, which damage overtime system do you want, blue, yellow or red?
All right, I exactly I shouldn't I shouldn't have tried this angle of attack.
45:02
All right, well, I'm talking for dead zone.
Let's get some.
Votes in here How many?
How many you have to go through this is how long.
We, we're, we're, we're, we're trucking along here.
OK, we'll get faster.
Don't worry.
Once we get to the heavy hitters, they'll just crush the other end.
Yeah, this.
Is true.
It's it, I mean, it's, it's, it's spirit fault here, right?
45:19
Is that the word?
Yeah, it's fear.
Fault.
Oh my word.
All right, so we're seeing Dead Zone Rogue out the door.
More like more like Dead Link, more like Dead Space, more like Leopard Dead, more like Dead Island, more like Telltale Games presented The Walking Dead, the final season.
45:36
Your award is a new title.
Almost anything would be better.
And thank you for coming.
Thanks for playing.
OK wild card Group 4.
We have our #22 overall ranked.
45:53
The King is watching versus our number 27th overall ranked Path of Accra and we have a write in real quick here for the King is watching who says hey, nice to This is from El Pedras, who says hey, nice to see someone talking about the game King is watching.
46:11
For a title that passed 300,000 sales super early, there just doesn't seem to be much on the Internet about it.
You've given me something to listen to during A12K row tomorrow.
So let's see that criticism.
That sounds like a long row for me.
Our writings for Path of Acura.
46:28
We got one from Greenborn.
Jesus Christ is Greenborn who says great episode.
Thanks for showcasing this amazing game.
We got one from Thull Kandra who says thank you guys for this episode.
Incredible game really.
Heart emoji and one from frequent writer Inner Lychee the Crawler who says Path of Acura was game of the year for me last year.
46:50
Everything from the art, music, lore and gameplay is perfect as far as I'm concerned.
Wished it was modable but understandable it isn't.
Looking forward to Lands of Acura the sequel.
The dev posts about it on the Path of Acura discord occasionally.
Great pod as always.
Lychee the Crawler, your Thank you for writing, and of course you're absolutely right.
47:08
Path of Acura, although I didn't love it, in fact, you know, I think I might call it the path of aggravation because at times I was like, yo golly, this is too much for me to handle.
But yeah, mods, this seems like an obvious choice.
47:23
So hopefully I don't know if the dev is mentioned whether or not they are planning on that in the sequel, but that sure would be nice.
So this was one fight where I do actually have to recuse myself because I was elsewhere during The King is Watching.
47:40
You don't have to recuse yourself, it's fine.
Oh well, in that case the king is watching.
Well, he can watch all day, but I ain't playing this game that's for sure Come on 2 dimensional God damn it's.
Ridiculous mistake, right?
The king is watching.
Oh my God, that is a top contender.
47:57
This is a.
This is.
AI don't know.
Mega Bowl eligible contender.
The King can't watch.
This game is fun.
This game is flat out fun and if you didn't, you didn't play it.
You got no, you can't say anything right now.
Well, so I, I didn't play the game because I was on vacation in a land where famously what they did to their monarchs is they put them in the guillotine.
48:21
But I did listen to the episode, so I can review that.
And I can say, gentlemen, you, you recorded a fine EP and it gave me a very good sense of what the game actually was like.
You were able to paint a beautiful picture and sounds like a fun game.
And I I was legitimately bummed out that I I missed the the episode.
48:39
I felt like King of Watch, King is watching was still a little bit under polished.
I think it has a higher potential to be like their stuff.
Yeah.
Like there wasn't enough differentiation between different kings.
There was way too much grinding to get the experience stuff for the upgrade stuff like things that were not part of the core gameplay but were enough to drag it down out of quite as good of a ranking for to me as path Macra.
49:09
Which was a weird game but like super fucking streamlined.
Just like press button to play game for me.
But then just ultimate synergy simulator where sometimes the game would be like running slow because it's like I have to spawn 50,000 lightning orbs now.
49:32
And it's got an ape.
You can you can play as an.
Ape and you play as many things.
Yeah, you can play as a skeleton man.
You can play as an ape.
You can play as a different kind of ape.
My biggest, my biggest complaint with Path of Akro was that the the like after action log that was absolute 100% nonsense because it'd be like 50,000 entries long.
49:53
You just like, I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't you need statistics.
Here I almost, I almost kind of like how absurd it is because it seems kind of like a parody of just like, oh, you're, you're a, let's call it a traditional rogue like game.
You have the little, the little message log of like you walk past the Bush, you walk past this boulder.
50:13
What if that was just scrolling by at 300 miles an hour every time that you did stuff?
And I'm just like, I it it, it's kind of a joke, but it makes me smile every time that I see it just go whoosh and like all of the things are on fire on the screen.
Yeah.
And I was, I was playing some more of Path of Akra a couple days ago and I got my first frost night win.
50:34
And there were times where I was on the ropes, but I I eked it out against the King of Many Colors at the very end.
Again, I think this is where like Riff Wizard maybe has the better final boss fight, but I feel like Path of Akra is just so unhinged like.
Truly is.
50:49
And his graphics are so, so good.
So weird.
They're like the best paint art from the Yeah, they're just great.
So it will doesn't like them.
I'm guessing we have them.
I mean, I don't, I don't know if I get a vote because I didn't do Path of Acura and I I opted out because that game looked like such shit.
51:09
Well.
Then.
Clearly it does look.
It looks both amazing and awful.
Awful, awful.
It's pretty bad.
It's pretty bad, but it's so for me, it's so bad that it comes back around to being fun.
But I don't begrudge anyone who doesn't get so.
We're all in agreeance, then.
51:26
The king is watching his.
Movie.
Well, one of you, really.
It's just me and Scott who can vote well.
Obviously we need to have the the just, you know, obviously by default we need the listeners say.
Well, Scott and I are both listening here to go, right?
I believe so.
51:42
But surely the power of the people is more important.
Well, Andrew, what would you be?
Voting for.
I can give us the the listener answer here too, if that sways anyone's opinion.
Sure, yeah, though it always.
Let's hear what it is and then decide if we care.
Yeah, no one's listening to this point anyway.
52:01
All right, King is watching versus path of accurate the listener rank overall.
Going to be King is watching though.
Well, let's sort this and see what comes out on top.
The way you said, well, that made me a little uncomfortable.
It's path of acro.
God.
Damn it, I knew it.
52:19
I think we know what the right path is.
But don't worry.
Count.
This is the stole an elation unfair.
Stop the count well.
We're seeing as it is not in fact a democracy, it is a Kingdom.
52:36
We are executing the monarch.
We're the door prize for the king is watching is of course the guillotine.
Wow, this is a terrible.
Old plated demonstrations would.
Allow this kind of nonsense to happen.
Well, when you're in control of the voting, you know it's it's when.
52:53
They.
Let you do it.
Yeah.
Is that?
What you're about to say, that's exactly what you're about to say.
Well, that's going to move us to our our actual tournament bracket here.
So we're going into the divisional round with, we'll start with our first one up here, our number two overall for the podcast ranked Caves of Cud.
53:14
And I'm going to read through some this.
We have the most listener letters for this one here, but we have one from Ravenheart who says I loved both of your episodes on Caves of Cud, was kind of nervous about your reactions to it, but it turned out great.
By the way, was Will not there because he didn't like it and was afraid of your reputation score going down question mark lol.
53:36
Yeah, you know, could be, could be.
Thanks for writing in.
Yeah.
Hey, Caves of Cud, or as Will calls it, Caves of couldn't be bothered to another.
One of the greatest games hey, I have to stop you I I I will lean on Colin here Colin loves the game.
53:51
I didn't do it because I didn't really, I wasn't into it.
But I I can see the value and I will say I'm.
I'm working him.
I'm I'm working on him.
That's true, friend.
Also also my case my case of CUD score is now it has grown up to 9.2 and honestly it might have been even higher but except it's not a real world like game.
54:16
Well, we we might find on that here in a minute, but a couple more listener comments.
Fudgy Yum 2122 says love the deep dive.
JoJo Nob says I love, absolutely love how most of the discussion of the gameplay is almost correct, which honestly is completely on brand for what Cudd is trying to do.
54:34
Hey, what a compliment.
Thank you.
Unironically.
Appreciate.
It now you.
Put like 100 hours into the game, if I go back and listen, I'm sure I'll be disgraced by our.
Well well this comment from dating TV says dating TV.
54:50
It's hilarious to talk about your cud ventures to friends who know little about the game because it sounds like you're making shit up but it's actually real LMAO.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
We have a a a message here from Narf, who I believe, if I remember right, I believe he was a part of the UI team for the game.
55:11
Narf all right, who says fun podcast episode a little sad you didn't think of the of the composer Craig to join you for our our music episode that we did.
Well, let me just say stay tuned for that over the next couple weeks.
He also says very lulled out loud to the quote John Cudd moment, by the way :) emoji.
55:32
And then finally one of the one of the one of the main side quest writers for the game, Kailyn Sandell liked and boosted the the post that I made on Mastonon and the the main developer of the game, Brian Bucklew also enjoyed the episode so.
55:54
Outstanding.
Well hey we enjoyed your game so thanks for tuning in.
And it was.
Those are some long episodes so good on you.
Y'all will be also be getting door prizes.
Well, yeah.
56:10
So in our our first divisional match up here of.
The IT might just be getting the grand prize though.
Oh, grand point.
I mean, I mean.
Like them personally in addition to the game.
But anyway, yeah, sorry.
Go ahead, Scott.
So it's Caves of Cud versus Path of Accra here.
And I feel like when I was first playing Caves of Cud, I wanted it to be Path of Accra so bad.
56:28
I was like, oh, there's so much cool stuff in this game.
I just wish it was like shorter and I wish this game was like jammed into the small form factor that is path of Acura.
And I love these two games like on totally opposite ends of the of like the length spectrum for for different reasons.
56:47
And I went so far as to like delve into like the mod scene, like trying to generate my own mod for caves of cud to turn it into a path of Acura like dungeon crawler.
Turns out there's a lot going on under the mod hood for caves of Cud.
But the more that I played it in the and like the after after beating the game and no spoilers for the for the end game for the end story.
57:10
But like, even though like the game is super long and it's effectively more of an RPG than it is like a a kind of coffee.
Like we, we have on one end of the spectrum, path of Acura, a coffee break rogue like in that you can basically beat in 30 minutes versus caves of Cud where like a run in that, well, I don't know what, like 1020 hours or something.
57:30
And you would think that like, oh, after a certain length of time, like it just becomes an RPG.
This is the one exception I think because like and again, I I, I want to talk about the ending, but I can't because I'm leaving it for Colin as like this beautiful gift to unwrap an experience.
57:46
I'll probably get to it this weekend.
Yeah, and.
I'm so overpowered right now.
I think that will under score that like this game, it is a robe light because there's certain parts of how this game works that couldn't exist as as anything else.
58:03
Like there's like caves of cud.
It just there's all of like the gameplay systems and historicity of it and like how the game's plot plays with all that.
It wouldn't work as like as any other game.
And it's such a crazy unique thing that like I'm I'm so glad that it exists.
58:22
I'm, I'm very happy that I was able to con all the rest of you to, to do like all the Super long episodes on it with the hope of, oh, maybe Colin will play a little bit more of this after we do the episode.
Yes, spoiler alerta did, yeah.
58:39
So yeah, I don't know how Path Backer can make Path Backer is a fun a fun like aperitif, you know, but hors d'oeuvre.
But Cave's CUD is the main course.
I want CUD to win, yeah.
58:55
Well, just to, you know, play devil's advocate if, if we, I think Path of Acura might be able to give CUD a run for its money in one specific very crucial element of rogue glycdum present, of course, at the very top of the list in the, in the, the Berlin definition or or whatever it's called.
59:21
Of course I'm Speaking of poetry.
Yes.
Path of Acura does spin.
Oh, a wonderful, a wonderful yarn.
A little.
Little These are probably two of our most poetic games.
Highly, yes, absolutely.
But I, I mean, of course, to to answer my own challenge, my own question, as we covered oh in episode episode 2 in about hour 5 or 6 of Caves of Cud coverage.
59:53
Just the the item descriptions in CUD are poetry in and of themselves.
All I know is that I'm looking at the game right now and the current character I'm on.
I'm on turn 294,000 so that's.
1:00:11
A lot of turns it.
Is a lot of turns.
That is the biggest slight against it in this roguelike competition is that it is.
It is an RPG with rogue like elements, not an actual roguelike.
And I thought for the longest time that like the the perma death mode is bad in that like well it well it is for new players.
1:00:37
Well, actually, yeah.
See this is the thing like This is why I'm so conflicted.
It's like for new for a new player experience it feels bad to be like Oh well I'm going to go on this huge quest and then I get bludgeoned to death by this invisible troll that I was not warned about.
Feels bad man.
1:00:54
But at the same time, like I feel like if this game started off as like a checkpointing with settlements at 1st and then after a certain point it unlocked the the permanent mode, then you would be like, oh, and now I have this other thing to like go and play with.
Or if the daily challenge mode was just permadath, then I feel I feel like there's like ways to play around with it.
1:01:14
But like, but again, after beating it and then coming back, I'm like, Oh, I get it now.
I see why this is here to kind of like force you to try different stuff and see what kind of gels with your play style.
Maybe it's not the best implementation of it.
Path of Accra certainly does have a better fail fast state where like you die and you're like, let's boot up another run, let's do it and with there's a little bit of hesitation there with Caves of Cud, but.
1:01:38
If the character I was playing with right now died, I'd never opened the game again.
Oof, okay, that's fair.
That's fair criticism.
But even with that being so, what are we?
What are we doing?
Beating around the Bush, which is something that you can do in Caves of Cud.
You know it, I know it, The listeners know it.
1:01:54
It's Caves of Cud by.
Yes, do it, yeah.
Move it forward.
In game unit mile.
We can talk more about Caves of Cuds than just Next next.
Matchup.
All right, our next division matchup.
Wait, wait, hold on.
What is Path of Acker getting?
Yeah, well, the door prize for Path of Acker.
1:02:09
I'm going to give it the door prize of 10 million glory for being just kind of like the perfect package of like the solo developer experience, the Babylonian blood mythology, the the really unique and like almost Conan the barbarian level NES style soundtrack really I'm.
1:02:32
Going to give it the door prize of a brand new UI log system.
Well, I also want to offer a an award which door prize which is a y'all remember in the Conan movie when the Tarzan dune, he like he like picks up a snake and he turns the snake into an arrow and shoots it?
1:02:54
Yeah, indubitably one of those.
Great.
Perfect.
All right.
Our next divisional matchup will be between our number 12 overall ranked.
Nope, sorry, 13th overall ranked.
1:03:09
My Google doc notes need to be updated.
Puzzle First person shooter puzzle game blueprints versus climbing up the ranks here are #12 Halls of Torment couple.
Two architectural based games.
1:03:25
What a perfect matchup. 100% comparable.
This first person puzzler.
A couple.
Room deck builder.
A couple of.
Writers Diablo 1 candy station.
1:03:41
I think it's how the the devs described it at one point, that if Diablo is your full three course meal, then all the torment is like is is is a nice little piece of candy, you know?
11 comment from a simp for Che Ryong says blueprints.
1:03:59
It made me feel smart for once.
No hand holding and then a comment here from I'm sure that's a lie says my wife loves watching me play video games.
I'm very lucky and sits there with a strategy guide if I need help.
Before starting blueprints.
I told her quote grab a notebook and write everything down.
1:04:15
We filled up an entire notebook over 2 weeks of play and I've never seen her so engaged with the game.
She wasn't quote playing.
So while I'm grinding out the RNG aspects of the game she's connecting the dots like a mad conspiracy theorist.
Honestly it's the most fun I've had gaming in my 30s.
Yeah, I would say that like that she was playing the game.
1:04:34
Yeah.
Like that's I, I feel like rarely would be like someone writing down what's going on behind you.
That's the game.
It's like, no, that is the game.
Like the the, the, the the person writing in was just being, was just the driver for his wife while she was playing.
1:04:50
She was playing the game through him.
Yeah, surprise.
Who Who doesn't have a notebook here with notes?
Yeah.
Blueprints.
I I I just raised my book.
With.
All my notes and they look like crazy.
They look so insane.
I, I only kept an oral history of my blueprints experience.
1:05:12
No, yeah, I I definitely took notes and I had a lot of screenshots.
Yeah, that, that is, that is what the.
Unabomber Yeah, that's exactly what I was going for here.
That that's how you feel when you're writing all these notes down.
Where did?
You take Yeah.
I don't remember where they are, but.
1:05:28
I mean, I'm going to go ahead I'll I'll just cast my vote.
It's going to be blueprints.
Blueprints is an A fantastic game.
If you haven't played it, you're missing out.
Halls torment great game, but this not the artistic style, the depth, the interesting compelling reason to get back into it.
1:05:45
It's just not quite there.
Like if you want to get to 100% of achievements, sure Halls of Torment but no blueprints is much more deep and interesting.
I feel like these are are two, like wildly well #1 they're wildly different in terms of.
1:06:02
Like, oh, no, no, they're both about different aspects of buildings.
Sure.
Yeah.
And there's lots of halls, hall versus hall battle.
Great.
Matchup.
No, they are.
More than, of course, as you say, they are very different.
Yeah, so I gave Halls of Torment a higher score than blueprints.
1:06:22
What in my rankings And I'm unsure like thinking back now and looking at both of them, it makes me, I mean 8.0 versus 8.2.
So not like that much difference.
I mean I think that I think that Blueprints should still win.
1:06:40
I think Blueprints is like groundbreaking and novel and super interesting and I think it deserves awards more than Hall of Torment, even if Halls of Torment was more like subjectively fun to play in the moment.
Like I will forget Halls of Torment, but I won't forget playing Blueprints.
1:07:00
Well, I definitely felt like I had a type 2 kind of fun with blueprints of like me, me thinking that I had like the the code for like the the building layout and like the different letters of like, oh, this this room here corresponds to this letter because of the chess piece and the blah, blah, all these other dumb clues and things.
1:07:19
And I, I thought I had the, the the code cracked and then I ran it past you guys and you were like, no, that's not even remotely right.
And I'm just like, well, that's great.
That is really great.
I'm glad I spent all this time.
And like with the what was it the, the billiards or the no, the dartboard puzzle?
1:07:36
Also, I'm like, yeah, OK, if I, if I had like an entire page of math written out of like, OK, well, if it's like this and if this number is odd, then I do this thing.
And if it's even than that thing.
And that was totally wrong.
Also I feel like this blueprints is a really great two brain game where you can have.
Someone you need some someone to like bounce your thoughts off of like am I?
1:07:55
Am I actually just like going mad here?
Be like, yeah, you are.
Whereas Halls of Torment is a really great no brain game where you just watch all of the the the candy fly around on screen.
They're both good for different reasons.
I feel like I don't know the the end game for halls of torment is maybe more fun than the end game of blueprints.
1:08:14
Not I don't think any of us played blueprints after getting to room 46, did we?
I I did a little bit, but I didn't get to the true end dish game, whatever it is.
Which there's what, like another 150 hours?
Or yeah, we were like, oh, we'll get to room 46.
1:08:30
That's the end of the game.
It's like, no, it's like a third of the way through or something crazy, yeah.
Really.
Maybe not a third it's it's you're not done by any means.
There's like many more than I don't know I.
Mean I stopped around then because I got it, but it's still.
1:08:48
Yeah, I mean, it's surprised if you are, if you are Prince pilled to the effect of like you get to room 46 and you're like, I need more, I must have more blueprints.
It's almost like they have like two other like games of blueprints level content after room 46 to some degree.
1:09:06
But you're still doing all the things that you've already done to get more.
Like you're still advancing through the mansion.
You're still.
I mean technically, but maybe there's more like extent to like lower or stuff I don't like.
1:09:22
I kind of bounced off of the end.
Hard where I'm reading.
I'm reading a Reddit thread about blueprints right now and they said I'd put you around 30%.
You're in late act one, maybe early act 2.
Yikes.
Well, the game was not framed correctly for me 'cause I was done when I got to the end early I.
1:09:42
I my guess is that that that's not not.
Actually true.
I mean, I'm willing to to put a vote in for blueprints here just from like the uniqueness aspect.
Me too.
Like yeah, like I'll I'll gladly go for novel over established every time, even if it's not perfect.
1:09:59
So, listener, thank you for writing it.
Listeners, thank you for writing in.
Sorry that your wife stole the game out from under you and you achieved nothing.
Sorry, she did everything and she's the the true player and the previous writer into the show.
1:10:20
You're absolutely right.
This game makes you feel smart.
Let it be known.
No problem with the dartboard puzzle at any point.
And what makes me feel smarter with that?
Yeah.
Than my than my I.
Know the call here really quick and.
1:10:37
I remember the one time that I failed the the gem box puzzle and I felt so shamed.
Now the gem puzzle on the other hand, hey yo, check it out.
You know, this this, this, this blueprints game.
1:10:55
All right, I get it.
It's a play on words, as in a Prince that is blue.
And also the blueprint for an innovative new type of puzzle game that revolutionizes the genre and turns it into an ever evolving or grossing puzzle cracking experience that even an FPS meathead like me can enjoy.
1:11:15
Obviously it's blueprints.
I think this is going to be the, you know, the basis for a new sub sub sub genre.
But we're moving ahead because we have a consensus.
It's unanimous.
Yeah, somehow.
1:11:30
Yeah, banish the halls of torment to another hall of torment.
I am kind of curious to see what the listener vote is between the two of them here.
And just to make the listeners mad, listeners voted for halls of torment, believe it or not.
So.
1:11:46
Yeah.
I mean, that's fair.
I've put more hours into Halls of Torment.
Yeah, I mean, like, I it's a game that is, I mean, it, it fulfills a role of, hey, it's 9:00 PM and I've had a drink, I've smoked some weed and wouldn't want to play.
1:12:03
Not blueprints.
No, I got, I don't want to use my brain.
I want to just run around a map and just, you know, watch Seinfeld and.
Yeah.
Blueprints is like that prestige drama.
Halls of Torments is like Love is blind.
It's just that trash.
1:12:18
That trash you watch.
I haven't actually watched it, but I hear great things.
It's so good, just the just the kind of trash the human brain was evolved to to consume at a fire hose pace.
Well, I guess like the the door prize as we shove halls of torment out through the fiery gates back into the the demonic halls from once it came.
1:12:42
I'm going to give it, I guess, the 1010 million XP points that are all kind of like zooming in, collapsing in on you like a singularity.
I'm and I'm gonna give it a quick correction.
I think I said that the the Sprite pack had six directions.
1:13:00
That's completely wrong.
So yeah.
Anyway, moving on.
We'll over track the episode.
We'll take it down to.
You halls of torment best door.
We saw a lot of good doors this season, but oh boy, like going into the level now that's whoo boy, that's a honker.
1:13:18
Very impressive.
Really good, really good transition from the demo into the full game where the where there's a lot more content, a lot more interesting things to do.
OK.
Yeah, we're, we're at our second divisional round game, maybe you've heard of it, a game called, I don't know, Hades versus our crawling up the the ladder here, number 19 Spirit fall Hades was.
1:13:44
All right, so Hades wins.
Yeah, let's move on.
We'll talk about Hades when we when it goes up against the winner of the next.
Yeah, OK, sure.
But real this.
Could have been so much more fun.
We could have had Hades versus dead zone, can't remember the name now that would have been that would have.
1:13:59
Been a zone of dead.
But a couple quick listener comments as we very Fast forward through this very obviously bludgeoning here 11 from what is this Colton MCC 786 has recently discovered this podcast and I'm enjoying listening to it a whole bunch.
1:14:17
Please keep it up.
Well, thanks.
And then we have one from Goobsnoob who wrote into the e-mail to say podcast great, no way community talk together need Discord podcast grow praying hands emoji heat card read good.
1:14:34
I think like, yeah, this is something that like people have asked about for a while.
I don't know, another thing to manage.
Like, there's already so much junk that I'm doing under the scenes here, but if someone wants to start a fan discord for us and they want to moderate it themselves, by all means, feel.
Free.
1:14:49
Maybe a subreddit?
That's probably really what we should do.
Like, have at it.
No moderation.
Go nuts.
We'll get all the sexy fanfic art of the hosts posted on there so well.
Our door prize for Hades.
Thanks for playing.
It was good to have it up against the Titan that is Spirit Fall now I guess.
1:15:10
What?
What do we give spirit fault like?
An animal?
Some sort of animal?
Just a generic animal.
What it what it I like the angle of like, what did Spirit fault do do best of any of the games that we played Very satisfying like knockout, like when you were doing those smash fights and you you blasted someone off the screen into the nether realm.
1:15:34
And the big anime streaking effect was pretty good.
Weren't we joking about how we wanted to just have like a Super Smash Bros Ultimate where it's just all the roguelike games though?
So maybe we'll give it like 10 new characters that are just like very like John Cudd the purple wizard.
1:15:53
Yes, yes, Mr. Mr. Dead Zone himself, etcetera.
We'll get the hero from Heroes Hour.
The Ring from Elden Ring.
Perfect.
Well, yeah.
1:16:09
Well, that's that's going to turbo mash us to our division.
Our next division will match up, which is between our 11th overall ranked game, Noida versus climbing out of the wild card ranks, our 15 ranked Elden Ring Night Ring.
1:16:25
All right, listen up suckers.
I did a little research after this episode and Noida, I found out that it's it's a finished word.
It's finished for mad cuz bad You don't like this game, it's because you don't like yourself and your all your your own gaming prowess ain't up to snuff.
1:16:45
So maybe consider doing a little work on yourself before you come gunning from a main man, Mr. Noida.
Maybe consider having a better objective than being, I don't know, like forced into a a tunnel where you're going to have some fucking magma or poison or whatever bullshit laying on your head.
1:17:02
No.
What about a minecart?
What?
What if there was a minecart at the start of the game that you could kick and have it go flying down a mine shaft and then land on some red eyed goblin at the bottom of it?
Human.
Eyeball.
Since the beginning of time has longed for two things to ride in a minecart.
1:17:19
And. #2 To get to the bottom, you want to get to the bottom.
There you got to go find the epic quest to get to the bottom most level, to persevere and venture forth into the dark.
Of course, of course, of course, of course.
1:17:37
Diablo or what was the game that we played in season 1?
I think it was the first game, Was that Dreadmore?
Dreadmore.
Yeah.
That's the one where you we're going to the bottom.
That's what we do.
Yeah.
Go to the bottom.
I get it.
Well.
In the way you do it, in such a stylish way, such a novel, novel novel is an insult in a a wholly unique and engaging way.
1:18:02
This is some of the best magic we've ever seen in a.
Game that wand crafting.
Yeah, you you can just summon boulders to crush people or summon boxes of dynamite.
Yeah, I think like the one crafting system for this.
I'd like as much as I like Elden Ring night Rain.
1:18:21
I feel like it's a it's a good idea that needs to be polished up some for like later stuff.
I don't, I do not think it beats Noida here.
Yeah, I think it comes, I think it comes close.
I mean, I think there's like Elden Ring night rain has a lot of stuff going for it in terms of just like appeal, like it's it's a big beautiful game.
1:18:45
There's stuff that's happening.
It's got Co-op, It's got a bunch of stuff.
Noida is, I think very pretty.
I think it's very interesting looking.
I think there's a lot of stuff that's fun about it, but there's also like hard and fiddly sometimes.
But it's also, I mean it it it kind of goes in the same slot for me with blueprints where it's like this is a this is forging its own path.
1:19:10
Like it is creating genre rather than something like calls a tournament, which is like refining a genre.
So I think he gets some extra points for that.
Our our our last listener write insurance for the evening here.
OK, you get.
For Noida we got we got one from Joshy Dash N4V that says this is basically quote powder toy the game.
1:19:31
We got one from Theron Keene who says I played Noida for 700 plus hours with no spoilers.
That has been one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life.
Easily one of my top three games of all time, and I'd call it one of the three best games of all time period.
1:19:47
And I say that as somebody who has been gaming since the NES days.
We got one from Timachen Chensen 8821.
Noita has many looping mechanics that give you permanent unlocks.
Orbs of true Knowledge unlock spells into the spell pool.
So do the Coral and Hell chess quests.
1:20:05
As well as many others that I think are kind of buried in that 700 hours of content.
We got one from Crab Finder R1M who says I immensely enjoyed this podcast, our Noida episode.
It says Noida is probably in my top three games of all time.
It's the only video game I played.
1:20:21
We're taking over 100 hours to get your first win is considered pretty average in terms of player skill.
This game is weird and brutal in an in a very unfair and sometimes stupid way.
I love it though.
We got one from Nathan the Ninja.
Taylor says Noida is the best game heart emoji.
1:20:37
It fights dirty and expects expects you to fight dirty back.
And our last one here from Biggie Sniper says Noida is a very hard game to get into.
I would recommend watching Quote the Worst Guy to Noida by Connor Conkers that does a good job explaining what the game is all about and how deep the rabbit hole goes.
1:20:58
There you have it.
The people, they long for the mines, they long for Norwegia.
It's it is a game that I should probably raise my score of because I I played it quite a bit more and found it to be exhilarating and also a a pretty Dang good example.
1:21:17
A Dang good example of a daily challenge run mode.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that daily challenge mode is like exactly the thing that I wanted Caves of Cud to have, where it just drops you in a random spot.
It's like, hey, here's some random crap, go nuts.
And crucially, when you die, you can restart that thing over again.
1:21:36
Yeah, good, good design on that 1, I think.
All right, Noida, I thought.
Noida.
Oh, Eldon Ring, it appears your night rain has ended.
Sorry.
Catch you later.
I don't know.
What are we going to give you as your door prize?
Like some souls or some shit?
1:21:53
Really big sword.
Really, really outrageously large sword.
Yeah, it's seems about right.
Maybe a pet wolf or something.
Three pet wolves.
OK, well, it's it's coming down to the wire here.
1:22:09
We're going to go into our first semi final match up with our number two overall Caves of Cud versus 13 Blueprints, both very cerebral, thinky games, very long games.
How do we How do we feel about these two?
1:22:26
Yeah, Blueprints obviously is going to be a winner here.
Don't even think twice about it.
What are you talking about?
What is happening here?
Well, the people are they're, I mean, we're getting paid to think about it twice.
So we need to at least, you know, consider all angles.
Yeah, I mean, I'll say that I liked Caves of Cud more.
1:22:45
Oh really, I would.
Not have had that from someone but but now we're starting to get into the depths of like what are we judging here?
Are we judging which is the better Rd. light game or are we just judging which games did we like?
1:23:01
More I I think that the real judge here is history.
And if we don't pick caves of cud we?
Are better boring about it.
I agree, Camille.
Absolutely not Call ma.
What are we?
What are we talking about here, folks?
1:23:17
There ain't no time travel in blueprints.
There ain't no.
I mean that kind of rifles.
There ain't no jet packs, there's no devious horsemen, there's very few mutants.
So few, so innovative.
1:23:33
Are you kidding?
No, no, no, you're right.
I'm, I'm joking.
It's it's, I mean, it's a little bit of a toss up, but I mean, perfection is its own type of innovation.
And Caves of Cud is just such a good roguelike.
I don't care what you say.
1:23:49
Colin Sarge roguish game.
That's boy, it's it's tough.
I feel like blueprints could be improved upon and that there will be a blueprints too.
I don't know how much better you can make Caves of Cud.
1:24:04
You could not make a Caves of CUD 2 like you couldn't.
You just, you couldn't like, there's no way like the way that like.
Spires of CUD.
The I mean well there is a Spire in it.
You are ascending it at some point.
1:24:20
But that's even if, like me, that appeals to me.
I'm going to stop you there and say I'm going to ascend some Spires.
What?
There is there is a a big bat at the top of the Spire that you have to get to.
Well, maybe.
There is.
1:24:36
There's something at the top of the Spire that you have to get to.
Yeah, Will what?
What if you were a a cybernetic Organism that could go around and proselytize people to your cause?
What if you are an apple farmer's daughter?
Or arms, each of which each of which had a crystal axe that could decapitate layering robots.
1:25:00
This appeals to me.
It should.
That would make getting to room 46 a lot easier.
Yeah, if you could, If you could face it in the wall.
Yep.
Yeah, what if you could just explode the walls and walk through as is your your cud giving right?
1:25:15
It makes it hard for me to judge here because I I I believe you.
I I did not give KS of cud a a really a good evaluation, I admit, and I think based on you, you Colin, based on your evaluation, it sounds like a great game and I it sounds like one that I should play.
1:25:37
But blueprints I have played and I have loved, and so it's going to be a blueprints for me.
And maybe I'm wrong.
I I will allow for the maybe I'm wrong to be a very strong element here.
Yeah, I mean, I think I'm going to vote for Caves of Cud, but I'm going to feel weird about it because I I really do genuinely like it's, it's stretching on the rogue, the rogue aspect.
1:26:03
It's it's got, you know, trappings.
Not a rogue.
I mean, yeah.
Grog pod rogue.
What light rogue?
Like what do we?
I don't know.
It's the rogue light.
Does anybody know?
Yeah, but but like, sure, in our pickings for the games, I don't care.
1:26:19
But now that we're in the like, let's rank the games that we played according to the genre of our podcast.
It does feel a little bit weird.
I'm well, this argument is in your favor.
I'm bleeding.
I almost am voting for blueprints over a game that I like significantly more because.
1:26:36
I'm not trying to bias you against that, by all means.
I mean, I, I, I just want the the winner to be the best of our of our extremely amorphous, ambiguous or criteria.
And at times, immoral.
1:26:52
Yeah, I I do feel a little strange about it as well.
I understand your concerns, Colin, but yes, I will be casting my vote in the caves.
The Caves of Cud, Yes.
1:27:08
I will as well.
I'm I'm moving it to the finals.
Yeah, I think like I'll be I'll be curious to see Colin's like finals decimation of of cud here.
But it's it is maybe one of the most interesting and unique sci-fi tales that I've experienced.
1:27:26
And that's kind of saying a lot because I've consumed quite a bit of it.
And like I was like notorious CUD hater when I first booted it up like this is and again, this was before like the one point O like graphical refresh and all that.
I've put like 150 hours of it, like mostly. 50 Wait 100.
1:27:45
I'm at 117.
And like Collins arguing more impressive because he didn't have like 8 hours of like working with like a specialized tutorial master who guided you through the game and like, and you put in like 120 something hours like just since we started reviewing it basically.
1:28:04
Yeah, I'm actually, I I think that maybe I had it like, running in the background of my computer for a long time.
Like I went to look up something on the wiki and forgot about it for 10 hours.
But that's still like, you can only do that so many times.
I put a lot of hours into it at this point, Yeah.
All right, well, it's as simple as that.
1:28:20
It's it's big simple.
In fact, keys of CUD runs away with it.
Gentlemen, what are we giving blueprints?
Well, Blueprints does have a lot of doors in it.
Gems.
It's got gems.
My door prize for inheritance.
1:28:36
Well, my door prize for blueprints is going to be a better meta progression system because I feel like the the dice rolls and stuff that like you get are good.
But I felt like I, I if I didn't have to like cheat engine the game in order to get all the dice rolls that I needed to beat it in order to like review it properly for the podcast.
1:28:57
Maybe I would have liked the end game a little more, but you know there I'm sure someone on Nexus Mods has has something on there for me.
Yeah, I'm going to give them a pair of shoes to help traverse Traverse quicker.
I am going to give that that young whippersnapper a lighter.
1:29:16
Actually use that dynamite in the in the shed.
Dynamite.
I like Collin's gun.
I think that's every game needs another gun.
But I'm an American, so you know, what do you say can?
You imagine if you just like open up one of the states, there's just a gun in there.
1:29:33
That sounds like something.
We called it real quick.
Sounds like something you would encounter.
Caves of Cud maybe?
All right, our next semi final two kind of super Titans of rogue lights or likes, I don't know, whatever we call them, our number three overall ranked Hades versus our number 11 overall ranked Noita.
1:29:55
Yeah, Hades.
I mean Hades Hades.
All right, now we can talk about Hades.
I feel like I could go either way with this one.
I definitely like Hades.
I've put what, like 100 plus hours into or something, but at the same time, like I feel like I've experienced all that there is to experience in Hades and that that's that's OK.
1:30:14
Like you can complete a game and be like, I think I'm good with this.
I'm sure.
Like it's almost guaranteed that we'll be talking about Hades to next season for sure.
And.
You finish games, it's true.
You you you do get to the end of the games in general unless they are designed to be forever playable, which is odd to be fair.
1:30:35
Like that's not a usual.
I mean, I feel like if you finish a game, maybe you put 150 hours into it.
That is an acceptable thing.
Yeah, it's not.
Not all games are chess.
Like some of my favorite games, I've only played 30.
Hours.
Will looks so serious when he said that.
Don't come messing around.
1:30:52
Don't even talk about chess.
Not all games are StarCraft 2 or Squad.
Now what if what what what if?
Chess, but speed chess.
And instead of the pawns and rooks on the board, they were aliens with jet packs shooting guns at you and you had a wand that summoned boulders homing homing boulders that when it hit something it spawned more boulders to attack it.
1:31:22
Wait, does it kill?
You, like Noida is literally the furthest you could get from chess.
There the only the number of dimensions is literally the only thing in common.
Will, to answer your question, yes, it does kill you because in Noida, everything, everything that you touch will kill you.
1:31:38
And I feel like that's that.
And I feel like that's half of the appeal because I was just doing a run just before this and I'm like, well, I OK, I picked up this wand.
It looks obviously very dangerous, but I have to, I have to try to see what this thing does.
And I press the button and it blows me up immediately and there's electricity sparks shooting everywhere and my my poor little purple robed rogue mage which just goes flying across the screen and like pinball bounces up and down between the ice caves.
1:32:10
I knew exactly what I was getting into when I pressed that button.
When I still pressed it anyway.
Got a press?
I get it.
I feel like Hades suffers from like in in the reviewing it right now, it suffers in that it has been a Titan for so long now it feels almost like passe or it's it's so culturally dominant.
1:32:32
It's.
No, we can't say.
Oh, this game is so old.
By the way, when was that Hades?
When did that come out?
Like 2023 maybe?
Yeah.
So not long ago.
No, no.
I mean, but it's like it's it's it's reached the upper echelon.
1:32:48
It's like games that it is broken out of the roguelike niche and like people who don't play roguelike game.
Like my sisters have played Hades, yeah, but like to completion and they're not the kind of people who play roguelike games.
Well, there you go.
1:33:03
That's a.
That's a pass right there.
That makes it.
But it came out in 2020 you.
Gronk, Gronk.
Now, listeners, don't worry, we're still going to be friends after this.
The Omega fog, the Omega Bowl.
1:33:20
Rather, you know, we get pretty heated.
But no, I think Haiti's is one of the greatest games we've played so.
It is.
It is like definitely higher on the production value side, like the voice acting like it, it can't be touched with the level and like the like 100 hours in, you're still seeing new like voice voice lines that like you never would have seen before and like and the.
1:33:46
Fact that something's new and sexy to you now it's like damn.
The bottomless pit that awaits us for Hades too.
Yeah.
Gosh, I don't know, Like Noida I've I've put at least like 50 hours into and haven't beaten once yet, but I'm still always curious to experiment and tinker with.
1:34:06
But Haiti's just feels like it's just on another plane of existence of like quality depth to it.
Like the meta progression system is, I don't know, like, you know, you can go either way with it.
But but yeah, there's I mean, there's something to be said about its casual appeal.
1:34:23
Noida I could definitely see people bouncing off of after using the wand and their body rag dolling through the ice caves.
Well I'm here and I praise for a top down isometric action game.
1:34:41
Coming from a bunch of Diablo 1 haters, this is.
Diablo one, no one.
Does this?
Absolutely.
I do despise it absolutely.
The worst game I think is what you called it and that is just not fair.
1:34:56
And I think y'all need to, you know, take some time to reflect, maybe take a look in your own, you know, mysterious star mirror of endless horrible meta progression look.
Here's the gem actually.
Do I want to sit down and engage with like some mediocre beat em up action just so I can enjoy another mediocre Hugo?
1:35:20
Never heard of it.
More like huge waste of time.
A mediocre light novel or do I want to play a real game come on, where I can aim my wand anywhere around and I can control the very powers I can bend reality to my will as a powerful purple robed sorcerer by Gollywood sorcerer's.
1:35:47
Yeah, you want to have 12 pixels dissolve into other pixels.
Yeah, I get it.
Yeah, that's what you're into.
I'm not going to try.
Noida.
Shame you here, but I am shaming.
More because that's 12 pixels than the entire script of Hades.
Look, I mean, come on.
1:36:06
I I Scott.
You tried your words in it, Noida.
Yeah, I mean.
There's lower story.
Yeah, there's lower that you pick up from like Emerald tablets and it has this very nice like transition thing where it goes from like these inscrutable rooms.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry, is this a book club?
1:36:23
Are we reviewing video games here, gentlemen?
Hades, come on.
Here we go.
Move it on, Move it.
Let's get to the.
Let's get to the.
No, Scott, I applaud you're, you know, at least attempting to to make it a contest.
I I realized that's, you know, Hades is.
1:36:39
Kind of people have good.
Run away with it.
He's going to dash away from it but you have to unlock by the way.
Like what do you get 1 undashed to start with?
If if it is a majority rule for Haiti's, maybe I'll just do like the the protest vote for Noida just to say that like that way I can be like the contrarian of like, well, I voted for Noida so you can't.
1:37:00
Blame me, but you know, but you know the audience response already.
Or if you don't, then you are insane and you're allowing the audience the the people that you have no idea the rabble.
Yeah, the rabble wait, I is it, is it split 22 or is it 3 to 1 for Hades?
1:37:19
Three to one.
Wait, Actually wait.
What did you vote for, Andrew?
I There's something about Haiti.
Noida so much I'm not sure now.
There's something about the Hades gameplay that just rubs me the wrong way that I have some beef, which is mostly a personal issue honestly.
1:37:35
Dungeon style that you hate the most, right?
That's what you hate.
So, so yeah, I will be void voiding for Noida, but I acknowledge that most of my issues with Haiti's are pretty, you know, personal and specific to me.
1:37:52
Now that Scott isn't just a protest vote, now he has to think about it a lot harder.
This is happening right now in real time.
The problem is, I know, I know what the voter answer is for this one.
1:38:07
And do I want to kick it to the voters, or do I want to?
Like.
Judge.
So I know based on that, that Haiti's is safe, thank God.
I don't know if that's true.
He wouldn't allow it.
He wouldn't allow the the voters to choose though, right?
1:38:23
Well.
Not so I don't.
Know I mean.
OK, OK, Scott, kick it off.
Do you want do you want to make the vote, or do you want to let the voters decide?
I'm not going to let the voters decide.
I'm going to I'm going to do Haiti because I think that makes for.
1:38:39
And again, like this is this, people are like slamming their brakes on the highway.
They're getting out with baseball bats and we're like, I can't.
Yes, we.
Are because we're a rogue light podcast, not a rogue like.
Well, like this.
I think this makes for more interesting grand finals if we have.
1:38:58
Two Hugo Award-winning games exactly, or whatever.
Yeah.
So I, I'm gonna I'm.
Gonna.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna vote for Hades here again.
Like these are both like Kurt, like this.
This could have been a grand finals and this would have been perfectly acceptable but we we have to praise Rodger Goodell for his NFL playoff system, which is what the the Omega Bowl has has since Co opted and done better than the NFL.
1:39:25
Roger Goodell, thank you for writing in.
We love your playoff system.
Big fan of the show Rodger Goodell.
Was a big fan of you as a person.
Noida's door prize I think is is going to be a a giga black hole that is is going to come out of the worm tunnel to to annihilate us for picking a heretical choice of Hades over Noita.
1:39:51
It's.
Going to show us who the true gods are.
Yeah, I mean, I guess the.
Gods of Finland.
For what it's worth, the listener vote was for Noita, but.
They know what's good.
Yeah.
I mean, again, this like easily could have been like the the real Omega Bowl grand finals between Haiti's and Noida, but that is going to push us to our actual grand finals here.
1:40:13
And what better way to do it between our previously number two overall that got bumped down to #3 Haiti's by our new number two overall Caves of Cud.
We have the traditional roguelike on one end of the spectrum versus like maybe like the the poster child for modern rogue lights with its meta progression and all that stuff.
1:40:39
We have politics.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, we we have turn based.
Games play Quote UN quote.
All right, so Hades, you say?
Well, we already talked in depth about a game with a blueprints.
1:40:56
Hades is a game with a red rocket.
Yeah, that's right.
This protagonist is a Dick.
Nobody likes them.
Come on, don't pretend to like them.
Also, devs.
Coward devs.
Coward devs for they're not being a sex scene with Dusa of Outrageous.
1:41:17
They you know, hey, they won a Hugo award.
I apparently the panel didn't didn't catch wind of that and if they had they would have, you know, stripped them of their title.
Yeah, this is this.
As you say, Scott, this is quite a match up.
It's like best in class of two different type types of roguelikes.
1:41:36
Yeah, I mean both super long winded stories 1 you have to beat 10 times to see the the real final ending.
One you will probably have to die 10 times just to beat the first dungeon.
The I think the the stories for both these games are both so rich in how they've been developed and intertwined with the gameplay.
1:42:01
Like the story is the game for both of these.
And in in one case, you know, you get that story drip with top tier voice acting and really great like comic book style Greek God art.
And in the other one, you are a, a flying mutant winged bird man who has laser pistols and have and you have a, a, a Gundam with an old bear man piloting it, fighting something like Mother Brain from the end of Super Metroid for control of effectively a space.
1:42:37
Yeah.
So basically the same game that we're talking about here.
One you go up and one you go down.
That oh, that's.
That's very actually.
Wait, no, that's not true.
You kind of go up in both of them when you start very low and you go up.
Yeah.
Really makes you think.
1:42:53
I after having re ranked case of CUD multiple times I now have them both ranked at the same 9.3 so that does not help me in my decision.
Yeah.
Colin, I'm curious to to have you expand on what makes case of CUD not a rogue like in your opinion?
1:43:13
It has a static overworld map and a fixed long term story and is not run based.
Oh wow, like the way that I'm playing it I've put I've put dozens of hours into the one single character.
1:43:30
Like a rogue like game shouldn't have a 40 to 70 hour run in it.
It's like it's the same criticism I had for rim world like or or factorial or Minecraft like they have procedural generation.
1:43:46
They take a lot of the like trappings of rogue like or or you know, the Venn diagram does not entirely.
There's many overlaps but it's not.
I think that if if Caves of cud wasn't a like grid based thing, I don't think it would be an argument about it.
1:44:02
I think it's just because it looks like one that we are so tied to the thought that it is a rogue light game.
Like if it was 3 dimensional and you were jumping around like Minecraft, I think we would think of it differently.
You'd be like, wow, this is a great game that takes rogue roguelike elements into it into a a into a nice it's an RPG loud.
1:44:23
But look, it's pulling things from this genre that we've been playing and and putting it in.
But we would never have said like, oh, this is the pinnacle of roguelike games versus Hades, which I mean, also has a pretty fixed story.
I mean, you are doing multiple runs with very different builds through all of them.
1:44:43
Like how many, how many times do you have to how many times does the average person do a run before they win?
It's like 30 or something, right?
So I've done four runs in Caves of Cud, with the three of first three of which I basically just giving up on characters until I finally found one that I like playing.
1:45:02
Sure there's a bunch of different like runs and builds to be had in Hades, but like just because you haven't seen the wealth of options available to you in caves of Cud doesn't mean they're.
Not no.
I have, I have, I also have an army of people following me.
1:45:18
I had like 9 followers at one point and I, you know, I swapped bodies into them so I could stat out all the spec.
I got my ape.
I got my psychic man.
I got my camel trader.
I got my robot lady.
I got my ooze.
Already sounds more interesting than the cast of Hades in my opinion.
1:45:36
I do not, I mean I would say I don't have any sexy lady but I am the sexy lady in also my games of cud character which I did in fact mind control dominate and then kill my old body so that I could be her forever.
I mean, what a game, what a game, describe what a?
1:45:52
Game is the cud so good.
Like there's just there is such a breadth and depth of possibilities available to you in the lands of CUD, whereas in Tartarus, oh, man, your dad's yelling at you all the time.
1:46:08
I play games to get away from reality.
I don't I don't fire up a game and excited.
Oh, what, what, what interpersonal conflict am I going to have today?
No, no, no.
I want to go to a fantastical science fiction quest.
You get to kill your dad.
Interesting.
1:46:23
Again and again and again and again and again.
And in one case he just lets you through unopposed and you don't actually kill him.
What A twist.
Yeah, I don't know.
I feel like I have to bat hard for cages of cud here because I feel like this is the only time in which even something that's even remotely like a traditional roguelike has the faintest hope of winning the Omega Bowl over over anything.
1:46:50
And like, I'm, I'm thinking through some of the games that we have coming down the pipe and like, you know, a game that was like 15 years in development by like basically two people, They got some more help along the way.
Like, I don't know, like I, I really want Caves of Cud to win.
1:47:08
I can see why it wouldn't.
It would, it would be understandable.
It would be disappointing.
I was trying, I, I went back to look like, where did COG mine end up?
Cog.
Mine got knocked out by dead Cells, which is like, oh, that's rough, Yeah.
Yeah, but I mean, at the same time, like what?
1:47:26
And I still think about that a lot where I'm.
I'm just like, you know, was that the right call to make?
And I think at the time it was cuz, you know, like, you know, dead cells is really good.
Yeah.
Dead cells is really good.
And most people, most normal people think about dead cells versus cognite on a daily basis anyway.
1:47:41
So yeah, I mean, this, this is like a David and Goliath match up where I think like capes of cut is the the sure underdog against Hades.
Yeah.
I mean, both of these games, I, I, it took a long time for me to warm up to them.
1:47:57
Like even Hades, like I really didn't have any idea what was happening.
Like the first two hours I was playing it just like, what are all these meta progression upgrade like, why do I care what's going on?
But eventually it got its hooks into me and it became like this absolute like competitive speed running event between me trying to beat Will's best time, I think for the bow or the spear or something before the recording.
1:48:21
I'm I'm going to do it.
And then it got like, like way more intense than I thought it would, which was great.
And yeah, I mean, the Hades is like the poster child for meta progression.
Caves of Cud is the poster child for I don't know, like.
Fuck you, there's so much stuff in this game, you're never.
1:48:38
Going to be able to account for any of it you've been.
Lasered like simulationist theories, build your world.
Read a lot?
Is that what it is?
Is that the difference is how much you have to read.
I mean, I will say the writing in Caves of Cud, there's a lot of it.
It is like for basically all of it being done by like one guy with like some help from a few other people.
1:48:59
Like, astounding.
How good.
I'm sorry, one guy, just some guy, a listener to our podcast.
Come on, let's show a little respect here.
Wait, really?
Well, I mean the well, the the person who wrote in was one of the the side quest story writers who.
1:49:17
Wrote well.
Even so, we love our side quest writers.
They were.
They were the one that did the Bay Law quest that I think that you've done.
The what?
The yes, yeah.
Yeah, but yeah.
Hades 2 can have it next year.
We Caves of Cud deserves its time in the sun, no?
1:49:40
No Hades.
Hades this year already deserves it.
Well, a great game.
Next year we'll have Hades.
We don't do about it.
We haven't played yet.
We.
Need to evaluate it.
What?
And I mean, what an inspiring story.
1:49:56
Basically a solo dev effort.
It's been in development for so long.
Yeah.
What's what's inspiring about Hades?
The graphics, the combat, the story, the meta progression.
What's inspiring about the development, I mean.
1:50:13
I don't care.
No, and I say that in all seriousness, like it is impressive when like solo dev effort impressive, but as you're if you're just rating, it is like which is a better game?
1:50:29
It does not matter if it's they're planning on doing more if it was made by a single person, all that stuff like I want to be, I I want to look at the games.
It's like, which game was more fun to play?
Which game brought me more long term enjoyment?
1:50:44
Like the fact that it was a single person is like, wow, that's kind of impressive, but it didn't make the game better.
It made it success more unlikely and the story behind it more a little bit more.
Interesting.
Well, I mean, I, I guess I, I would argue that, oh, it's such a close call.
1:51:01
I mean, not for me, obviously, but such a close call for, for the, you know, the two of you that we need to start taking into account these, these other, these other elements and these other, you know, these, these, these, these wild card elements like which has the more inspiring development cycle, which has the more bold storytelling decisions, which one goes right up to the line and then decides, you know, what actually do so was asexual the whole time.
1:51:26
Which one has done more for the popularization of rogue lights as a whole?
Who?
Cares about that is another thing.
I mean, if we're talking Andrew's the one who's bringing in outside information, you know, as a the fact that I can have a conversation with my sisters about what rogue like games are and they can have that conversation is due almost entirely to Hades.
1:51:50
Wow, that all right.
And while we're at it, we should say which is done the most for popularizing Greek mythology.
Mike Drop like Colin can talk with his sisters about a rogue like game.
About about a game where you have to deal with your your virtual relevant.
1:52:11
Popular game is what I'm trying to say.
People get it regardless if they're into this genre the the appeal of it.
Transcends genre well.
Transcends popular.
Exactly.
I think it's going to be most popular with our listeners.
1:52:27
And God is a game.
I'm going to have to.
You know what?
Nerds are going to get into I love your nerds.
Let's let's not, let's not beat around the Bush.
We're all nerds.
I get it.
But like, that's a very nerd game.
Hades is a game that people that there's a much wider appeal and we also appreciate it.
1:52:45
It's also a good game to us.
I'm going to, I'm going to vote for Hades.
I think that The Case of God is a masterpiece.
What happens?
But I'm going to give the edge to Hades because I think it is more of a roguelike game than the game that looks like the pinnacle of roguelikes.
1:53:00
Scott, are you are you hearing this?
There was this inspiring tale happening between Will and Colin.
Like Will's like, you know what, I trust you best, bud, that like if you say the game's good, I'm going to believe.
And now it's.
Been I'm not saying that I still, I'm saying that they're both.
I still trust Colin's opinion.
1:53:17
They're both in my They're both solidly in the like.
These are the best games I've played in my life.
Well like rim world, cog line, case of cud, hades, monster train, dead cells, dead cells, bellatrious slaves, firefast and light.
Like all right, those are some fucking good games.
1:53:34
Like you could pick any one of those and say this is the winner of Animaga bowl and you would could make very strong arguments for it.
Except for rim world.
But what?
If now what if we What if we did this?
What if we did this for special Omega Bowl finals overtime rules where my if we're split here, we could either do the listener vote as the tiebreaker or we could do Collin's Challengecoin flip as the tiebreaker.
1:54:04
But what if we do this?
What if we flip a coin to decide if we do listeners or coin flip?
You almost double overtime.
Scott, do you know the outcome?
I do know the outcome, which is why I kind.
Of that's a bullshit sort of way of framing.
1:54:21
This right?
Where's my very special coin?
Oh no, I cleaned it, now I can't find it.
Oh, here it is.
A coin flip.
Oh what you literally typical Hades game.
You have a.
Coin from last year in your hand right now I.
Don't always have this coin, just what's on my desk.
1:54:38
Oh my God, the Boeing that Boeing coin is.
That, yeah.
Of course, the Boeing coin.
Listeners one side one side is the engine turbine and the other side is octo engine power.
I I I tried.
I didn't try hard enough, obviously.
All right, so, so is the coin flip to decide it or is the coin flip to say, all right, we're like the winner of the coin flip determines like if it's going to the listeners or we're going to the actual coin flip it.
1:55:02
Feels bad if the coin flip is a decision.
That's it, Yeah.
You don't want a coin flip to decide something.
You want the coin flip to decide the action which decides.
Well, that's a That's a game.
Mechanic that we all can agree on, right?
Hold on, hold on.
What if we drew three options and picked one from them?
1:55:19
Yeah, yeah.
There you go.
Pick one of three is obviously one of three.
One of four.
You know either way.
We got the hosts, we got the coin.
I mean, I'm going to go ahead and say the all right, so here's, here's the coin flip.
1:55:36
Heads we go with the listeners and tails we go with the overall rank of us in terms of numeric score.
Which is.
I don't I'm, I'm not going to tell you because I is that, but that does that seem reasonable?
I have not rated caves of CUD though.
1:55:52
That is your fault.
If you wanted to be a part of the podcast, you'd be a part of the podcast.
Fuck this podcast.
Well, to be fair, to be fair, to be fair, Will has been creating, crafting his own cyberpunk adventure while we were busy cutting away.
1:56:14
So there's only really enough time for like 1, you know, mega mega post apocalyptic cyberpunk thing in someone's headspace forgiven time.
So I think that could be forgiven if someone was actually building their own game at the same time.
But yeah, I think that like if if the.
1:56:30
There was a very real chance that my coin flip would be the same game for either 1, so fuck.
It.
Flip it, whatever.
All right, so so heads.
Heads is what here.
Heads.
Heads is Heads is listeners.
Tails is overall numerical ranking amongst the podcast hosts.
1:56:49
I don't even know what I want here.
Yeah, flip it.
Tails, what do you got?
Caves of Cud 9.18.
Hades 8.92.
Cave this is not hate will look you got you got your way last year you got your.
1:57:07
Way see I'm but I'm expecting I'm expecting will to go play this game and then rate it like 9.5 so.
Yeah, it's fair.
It's actually 100% fair.
I am mad now, but I might not be mad.
In a moment, all right, And we're going to find out.
Yeah, so, so here, here's the the reveal.
1:57:23
This is the this This will be great audio for people driving their cars on the freeway and of.
Course.
Yeah, yeah.
This is the the sheet where I just have them sorted by the I guess the podcast seed here.
So caves of cud #2 is on top and #3 is Hades on the bottom.
But all these cells are blacked out.
1:57:39
We don't like, I don't know what the the numbers are underneath here, but I I mean I implicitly already know what this column M here is for.
But if I go ahead and unblank these cells.
For the the listener's choice, the correct choice.
1:57:55
The Listener's Choice have picked the listener rank overall as Caves of cud #1.
Of course.
And don't we just have the great list, the greatest of listeners listening to this fine, fine podcast?
What a deal, What a deal.
And I guess for completeness.
1:58:12
A lot a lot more engagement on YouTube shorts there for cage of cud you must have done.
More stuff this is This is why I have the the the normalization re ranking algorithm that goes through 'cause they would literally just be whatever has the most YouTube short volume to a bit Hades was #4 like that's you know, that's not nothing.
1:58:33
So our our top our top listener rankings here were caves of cud was #1 followed by a or a Noida Jesus caves of cud Noida path of Accra, Hades, halls of torment, rift wizard Elden ring night ring blueprints spirit fall.
1:58:49
The king is watching heroes hour and rounding out Omega bull 3 was dead zone rogue.
Yeah, I think the the the top three of the listeners being Caves of Cud, Noida and Path of Accra is.
That feels right, or that feels maybe not right, but that feels like not surprising to me.
1:59:07
Fine.
Indeed.
Indeed.
And now, since we're at the end of another season, we go around the table.
Say.

When you inspect it, oh baby, does this have a sweet text description, a Hugo award-winning text description of this incredible trophy.
2:01:10

You'll be like this is this is amazing.
I'm loving this.
2:01:26
Either that or he won't like it, I really don't doubt.
I don't doubt that I'm going to enjoy that game, but I still really liked Hades and that's all I.
Know that's fair.
So, you know, if it if it comes down to a coin flip, then you know, the the the teams put everything they had out on the field.
2:01:44
They left nothing else.
And yeah, I think that's kind of the best outcome we could we could hope for.
Well, thanks again for everyone writing into the show for a third season.
Thanks again to the the the Co hosts here that make all of my production work worthwhile.
2:02:04
And yeah, if you also want to have your broken English read aloud on the program grogpodzone@gmail.com you can send that in Mastodon Grogpod at game dev dot place.
Grogpod dot zone has a website with all of our rankings and previous episodes and all that good stuff.
2:02:22
Our next episode, I actually don't know if it will be the standard one of me doing packs show floor interviews or if it will be an interview with the composer of our I guess it's also good that it it won the Omega Bowl.
2:02:39
Hey, by the way, your game came in second place.
I mean, I feel like no.
One could be that mad about their game coming in second place to Hades.
True.
Yeah, I guess that's fair.
But yeah, I think I'll be, I'll be setting up a, a, a, a quick stand alone interview episode with the composer from Caves of Cud, Craig Hamilton, as well as a different standalone episode for PAX show floor interview.
2:03:02
So keep an eye ear out for both of those coming soon before our next season 4 kicks off.
But yeah, to, to play us out from this episode will be some, some music, I guess to kind of wet your whistle a little bit for, for that upcoming musical interview episode.
2:03:25
And it didn't have anything written down there except I had no idea if CUD was going to win or not.
But but yeah, it'll, it'll, you know, it's CUD music.
We all love it.
Maybe some moon stairs, maybe some some climbing the spindle, we don't know.
It could be some jopa, it could be yeah, it could be anything.
2:03:41
Could just be a bear grunting in the woods because that's kind of what some of the some of the soundtracks have.
Exactly.
But we'll, that'll, that'll play us out here from Season 3 and we look forward to seeing you in Season 4 live and drink.
