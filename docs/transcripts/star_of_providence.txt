before I remove the reference here. Hello,
0:35
and welcome to the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast, where each episode we dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge away from millions of bullets fired from a game that we defeat by reviewing it. Only
for it to come back at the end of the season in true epic boss fight manner for the tournament of other Roguelike games that we've covered so far. I
0:59
am your talking cat host of the podcast, Scott Berger, and with me are my purchasable from the shop co -hosts. Howdy,
it's me, Andrew. Horror
type shmin. What?
And
1:16
Colin, a laser weapon that's also cursed that if you touch a wall, you die. You
might be wondering where Will might be. Well,
he is a week didn't have enough banked up scrap to unlock him for this episode, which we'll get to in a minute, because this week we're talking about a monolith of a game. We're
1:36
talking Star of Providence, released June 7th, 2017. For
right now, as of our April 11th recording date, it is only on PC. But
due to be coming out on Switch soon, I'm guessing maybe sometime this year. Brought
1:55
to you by your favorite video game streamer, a video game donkey who started his own video game publishing company called Big Mode Games, who sought to bring Star of Providence to the Switch as one of their one of their first games in an interesting twist. Star
2:12
of Providence is developed and published on Steam by Team D13. And
in Star of Providence, your average player of this game has about 26 or so hours of playtime. Star
of Providence rolls in on Steam at our 386th most popular roguelike game with 81832 total reviews. Colin,
2:37
what weapon keywords can you string together to describe Star of Providence in one sentence? Um,
it is a top down bullet hell with a little asterisk, uh, space gun shooter where you fly around in a little ship and you power up your stuff and eventually you beat a boss. Or
3:04
so I'm told because I never actually got to it. And
the asterisk is that I don't feel like it's it's it's it's definitely a bullet hell, but, um, there's there's a couple things in it and I feel like make it not, uh, exactly the same as like a true bullet hell that not as hellish. Yeah,
3:22
exactly. There's
like cover and stuff, which I think separates it from the true bullet hell is and why I actually think it's a pretty decent game. So
we'll get into that, I'm sure. Well,
my first bullet point, uh, in my Google Doc here is Will and Colin are going to hate this game, LOL, which number one. Oh
3:42
yeah. Well,
I guess that kind of explains where one of our MIA co -hosts is where I think, uh, Will played this game for a little bit. I'll
give him credit. He
played for a little bit and said, you know, this is twice. Yeah.
3:57
So
I mean, I appreciate that. But
I think he was he felt like he just he couldn't give enough of a qualified opinion and diverted to us the experts for this one. So
while while he does have a ranking in the Google, she put an asterisk next to it and didn't include it in the in the formula calculation. So,
4:16
uh, he he his 4 .5 out of 10 rating lives on in spirit for this episode. But
yeah, I think like what you described Andrews Brows furrow as he hears these. Yeah.
And
4:32
I don't think this is going to be an all devs go to heaven episode because I think we reserve that that phraseology for things that like we we unanimously unanimously agree that like maybe this isn't quite for us, but we understand that there's a big following for it. But
4:49
yeah, I think we'll just we're just a bowed out for for this one. On
the other hand, uh, this was Andrews first time playing this game. And
I was like my eyebrows were blowing off my head to see that you basically beat it in one day. Well,
5:04
to be clear, I only beat the the first the first of like three main bosses, right? Three
final bosses, if you will. Yeah,
I think it took me six hours to get to the floor five boss and but we didn't realize until later like, oh, the only reason that I got like an end game screen was because I made a decision in my navigation. So
5:29
I just had a little help by my my own inability to navigate the game. Yeah,
I now have just over 20 hours. And
I have beaten the third final boss. And
5:45
what a hoot. What
a hoot. What
a time it was. I
tell you this game great bosses all around. I
think they're pretty spectacular. Even
the mini bosses are like noteworthy in my humble opinion. But
before we get at all that, I think what you're saying, Colin, what you said right out the gate is is key and very important that like this game is a top down shooter with a schmup's shoot them up space shooter like aesthetic, but also components of the gameplay like the boss fights are very much more schmupy. And
6:21
I think the game does a really great job sort of marrying the two genres of top down shooter and shoot them up. So
for my reference, shoot them up is just when you're at the bottom shooting up. The
bottom or the side, I suppose. You
6:38
shoot them up. But
it's a it's a single direction. Correct.
Generally,
it's like an auto scroller. And
you are on the bottom or on the side. And
you know, classic arcade sort of space shooting setup. Yeah,
6:54
I guess that makes sense. So
it's like the the level the levels before the bosses and the little mini bosses, those are just top down bullet hell ish. And
then the end one that the bosses themselves are still I guess like a full shoot them up. But
7:10
well, I so I have a I have a discussion point here about this game being very much more in the bullet hell end of the spectrum, right, versus some other games that we've played thus far that are top down shooters that I'm I don't think this is an actual term, but with where I'm going with this, I'm putting them. Okay,
7:31
so our first our first category going from the most ferocious and hardcore of these kind of top down shooters are bullet hells. And
those are your your R types, your 1942s, your things that you find in arcade cabs, Ikerugas, radiant silver guns, Don Pachy's, all those, all those things. I'm
7:53
kind of amazed to see how many of them are available for switch. So
kudos to people who can actually navigate these things. But
I think one of Colin, like you were kind of pointing out that like one of the main features for these are like these huge hypnotic patterns of bullets that fill up the screen that you have to weave your amazing bullets. Yes,
8:15
it's almost yeah, but I've my bullet point. I
propose in the Google Docs is tiny bullet mazes. And,
you know, that being kind of like a staple of of these rules, kind of like tentpole arcade games that are hugely popular, like these are things that are like massively popular, maybe not like specifically with with us per se. Would
8:39
it be is it accurate to say that the schmups genre is more popular overseas? I
mean, I mean, from what little I know about the the shoot them up arcade sphere is that it seems like wildly popular in Japan and possibly elsewhere. But
9:01
that's that's really where I see it taking off, particularly with this like entire, I guess, subgenre of shoot them up games called to ho or to to to who I think is now I've heard it said maybe someone will correct me. Yeah,
9:18
I many years ago I was volunteering at Sakura Con, a pretty large local anime convention. And
I was I was on staff and I was sitting in on a panel and making sure like the AV situation was going on. And
9:34
it was like it was a panel called like all about to who or everything you ever wanted to know about to who and I'm like, well, what the heck is this? You
know, the host is in this very elaborate cosplay. And
I was really confused. I'm
like, wait, it's a video game, but it's also a space shooter. Like
9:51
and that's yeah, it's like an anime and visual novel. Yeah,
it's a wild fusion wildly popular. So
it's like instead of being a spaceship, you are a like floating like magical girl. And
it's the same general sort of gameplay and that's been around for a long time. Colin,
10:07
do we have you back? All
right, just in time for you to comment on Tohu. Oh,
yeah, I don't understand it. I
tried to play. I
tried to I well, I tried to I didn't try very hard. I
was like, well, maybe there's one for super cheap on steam and there wasn't. And
10:23
I'm like, well, I've done surprisingly. Surprisingly,
there is a there are a handful of and I'm going to be butchering like Toho, Tohu, I'll just say to Tohu. To
who and who may concern. To
10:40
who Endless Dream is a very highly rated one that I think I have in my steam library on the family share, but I've just been I've been too scared to open it up. Because
I'm like, I don't know if I'm good enough to open this game and play like one level of it, or if it's just going to be like interweaving, like hypnotic, like LSD patterns of bullets that I have to navigate my single pixel around. Ink
11:04
blot tests of bullets flying at you. Yeah,
this this game, even though it's not like a traditional bullet hell schmups, I think it's probably at least when it gets the vice boss fights, like the hardest, more like most hellish bullet hell game that we've played. Yeah,
11:22
because this this game focuses a lot more on, I think, user or your player character movement and like the dodging system is very different, which I guess we'll talk about in a minute. But
OK, so so in this in this categorization of bullet hellish right back to your definition, we got we got bullet hells your your like actual like I am in hell. There's
11:45
so many bullets on the screen versus what I'm cloning as bullet hex, which are your your binding of Isaacs, your enter the gunjins. And
I guess to some extent, Hades even, because there's a lot of like stuff on the screen, but it's it's like big and slow enough that people like us can actually like skill our way around it to some extent, which I will say at a higher levels, like end game like gunjoon gets gets pretty rough. But
12:12
yeah, generally speaking, yeah, it's yeah, in the heck. So
I was thinking about it, because I don't really like the traditional bullet hell, where it's just a maze of bullets. So
I was coming into this not expecting to like it super much. And
12:29
I don't I don't particularly enjoy the boss fights of this game because they're the most bullet hell ask. I
do really like the comment of all the rooms where there is cover. I
feel like that is the huge big differentiator. Like
12:44
the the way that you play when you're like dipping in and out of cover is a very different play style than when you're just constantly like navigating the bullet maze. And
I feel like that's one of the big differentiators between the like the standard room combat and a traditional bullet hell. Now,
13:07
Colin, what if you what if you had the option to be the boss shooting zillions of bullets or axes or rotating bibles around you? I
mean, I did play a lot of bad for survivors on mobile while I was stuck in the eclipse. So
13:22
and that that I think is kind of like the the full circle moment of this where you have your bullet hells, you are weaving in and out of the bullets, the bullet hex where it's it's toned down a little bit more for casual audiences. And
then you have the bullet heaven experience, where you are the boss shooting out all these waves of hypnotic bullets and destroying thousands of enemies, your vampire survivors, your rotator, your your your rotators, your halls of torments. And
13:50
I think that that is kind of like the gradient of of like mechanical skill needed to play like this overlap like this huge like bullet oriented genre of top down shooter games. Right.
Like
the best builds of vampire survivors are when you no longer have to move anymore and you would just stand in your your weapons, auto kill everything that's coming towards you. The
14:14
surprise secret super secret end boss of this game, I'm sure, or of some of some bullet hell game. But
yeah, this this game, I think, really has it starts off with, I think some more stuff that will was lambasting in our in our discord with, I think, retro part of it real quick lambast sort of implies that like it deserves it or that like there's a open target, like an obvious thing to be to be ridiculed. And
14:46
that just isn't the case. Well,
without going in on our absent, for the apparently will is very put off by retro aesthetics, music, graphics, etc. Even
if they're beautifully assembled. And
15:02
that's part of the reason that he had a hard time with it, apparently he is allergic to the entire NES arcade era, which you know, I'm sure that's a thing that I can tell. Yeah,
but like, that's not for everyone. I'm
totally, I'm totally fine with that. But
15:19
like, this is a game that really bats for that kind of retro NES style aesthetic. But
like, such in done in such a good modern way that I like you can tell it's inspired by it, but it's so like modern in its implementation that yeah, like the text looks like it's from an NES, the like the intro cinematic that we have looks very like NES style color palette and graphical capabilities. But
15:52
it has so much like richness to it that it's like, yeah, like the NES would never be capable of handling like this kind of animation and quality. It
is clearly like technically much more advanced, but it still maintains the aesthetic and the illusion that you're looking at an older game, right down to like it being a, you know, just square straight up like four by four aspect ratio, you know, or a la an arcade game. Yeah,
16:22
I think it's the if you had all of the technical limitations of an NES in terms of the pixel outputs, but none of the compromises that they had to make on terms of like, oh, we only have 56 kilobytes of RAM, so we can't have to like reuse sprites for everything. It's
16:38
like, no, to get the full get the full everything, but it's constrained within like a very narrow window of like NES goodness. NES
unlimited. And
that goes for the music as well. I
don't know that the technical jargon or but I think it uses is it considered to be eight bit music? I
16:58
think it's a bit chip tunes is what you'd call it. Okay,
it's certainly it definitely has like noticeable tones, but I wasn't sure if there's like an official term for that. Yeah,
and here's an important question. What
did we have our CRT filters set to because I pretty much maxed by an out I was really vibing on the retro I have. I
17:19
have a derelict CRT TV sitting in my garage right now. It's
wrapped up in packing blankets, and I was on the verge of breaking it out for this game specifically. But
I don't have a good way of like connecting either my computer or my steam deck to a coax cable in the back of it. Because
17:39
the yeah, this game feels like it, it not that really belongs on a CRT, but it would be so at home in that aesthetic. Right.
Here's
another thing that will be jumping up and down for. I
17:54
had it on but the art is like very I think it's with the exception of for my for my experience with the exception of one like random terrain detail, which is supposed to be like a little flashing like klaxon light. I
18:12
you know you can recognize everything. It's
clear. It's
pretty clear like what these like wild character and creature designs are supposed to be in technology designs. That
one little klaxon light I kept thinking it was a telephone like an old timey like red Batman phone. I'm
18:29
like why is there just a giant telephone and all these like literally hours and hours of gameplay and like oh that's that's a little spinning light I see. It
looks I think the sprite outstanding and like you layer on top of that like the different like VFX right term but the different like particle effects. Dare
18:47
I say it like it looks really awesome and the movement and anime especially again in the boss for outstanding. But
yeah, back up a little bit. So
to be clear the layout the format of this game is that you've got like these I think seven total layers levels of the game and we're missing we're missing out on the deep lore that. Oh
19:11
sure. I
will ask just please. Where
our story begins with this very cinematic scrolling over this nice sunset city and then uh -oh there's some sort of gigantic I guess alien question mark building some sort of technological menace that clearly doesn't belong. A
19:30
monolith? A
star of proponents perhaps? A
tower yeah pardon me I know I got that. A
legally distinct entity. And
then this there's some kind of big explosion that happens and I suppose the city is ruined but that doesn't stop some intrepid explorers and you have this this very nice uh uh text crawl that goes across the screen says long ago an old facility was rumored to hold fantastic technology powered by an enigmatic source somewhere within a well of eternal power. Dormant
20:09
for ages its doors have opened anew and welcome the visitors who I guess are you in in a spaceship uh or like you know your standard kind of R -type uh shooter vehicle of some sort um and in theory there's supposed to be a second ship but I'm not good enough to unlock it yet. I
20:27
think Andrew you have actually unlocked it because you've beaten the game on do you need to beat it on hard mode to unlock? Uh
you need to beat the level you need to beat the second of three final bosses and then you get that you get the new ship which as far as I can tell mechanically is very similar it's just when you play that ship you are now in hard mode. I
20:48
see okay playing hard mode is what gets you the third final boss um and and there's like there's like four other ships how do you get those? Uh
I looked it up on the wiki I forget uh there's there's like various ways that you can unlock it by just like through through different encounters uh in the game but yeah they're not like not readily available. Yeah
21:11
it's it's on the the long bullet point list that I have here for like is this game better or is binding of Isaac or Gunjan better in what respect and I think that like one thing that Gunjan and Isaac do better is like having more obviously easily accessible character classes to start with uh that I tend to agree like it doesn't it doesn't hinder this game but it would be something that would be possibly a welcome addition but yeah there's like there's like a skull uh character you can play as there's yeah like we said the other kind of titular um uh visitor to to the facility that when you play on hard mode and you beat that uh that whoa whoa hold on hold on a second what are you are we going into some spoilers here? Well
21:57
okay yeah so so maybe we'll we'll dance around that for the moment but um but yeah so you have you have your ships that come in and you start with this pretty good I would say like a pretty good tutorial sequence I think whenever these games do you reasonably good tutorials it's worth calling out where it gives you this kind of like approach sequence to the facility we're going through these ruined uh streets and oh yes this is how I shoot my gun this is how I dash across obstacles this is how I open up the minimap and teleport to other rooms instantaneously which oh great oh just anytime that I'm playing enter enter the Gunjan I'm just like why why is this not in here? I
22:38
mean yeah it's it's definitely faster than enter the Gunjan and what's funny is that like if this game did not have an instant teleport to any room you've already visited feature it wouldn't even be that bad like the game's already pretty fast too and so the fact that they they they put in the effort to they thought to include that is like wow these devs are really looking out for me in my quality of life yeah there's one of those things though once they add it in you're like oh I see why it hasn't existed in video games before but now that it's been it you just it should be in all games that are this type because it's fun to just wander back through older rooms and have nothing in them for sure for sure and to be clear you can only teleport of course once you have cleared the room right or exited the room by some other means and these rooms so like yeah you start you start a level and it lays out you know procedurally raise it lays out a a little sort of dungeon type of a situation that you have to navigate on a grid and the rooms are nice and varied you know and and the the assortment is really good but once you enter like a new room you're you're stuck in that room and it's a square arena which at first I thought was going to be too small like looking at screenshots of the game like yo there's not enough space to really stretch your you know wings and fly around and enjoy the gameplay but I was convinced pretty pretty quickly that they had chosen the correct room size and it offers like a lot of a lot of variety because these rooms are populated by a lot of stuff there's obviously the enemies of which there are a myriad with sort of distinct looks and effects and things like that there is the terrain column that you were talking about there are different environmental hazards and effects there's water which will slow you down there are like wind turbines that'll blow you around there are blocks that you can shoot and move around and potentially you know cause collision damage lots of different interesting things happening in this room did you notice with um with the water effect if you go into the water much like an NES it has that kind of like cpu overload of where like everything sounds slowed down yes indeed which I thought was a lovely detail and also crucially the projectiles and the vehicle slows down in the in the water so you can there's a lot of things to interact with and to use to your advantage and like these these interactions these fights happen like pretty quickly and like when you cleverly you know exploit one of the terrain features or you blow open some blocks and use it to make a little tunnel to jump in and take cover like it feels ooh really good and yeah as you say column that's that's I think the the terrain and the the navigate is something that makes it um more palatable and arguably in certain ways more interesting than up's game where movement is yeah I I mean I was trying to figure out why I like this game but don't like other bullet hell games and I think that's the the the thing that I came to was that I like that kind of movement that is created by rooms that have cover or things like that when you're kind of like a tempo game then rather than just your dodging game totally totally oh I like hyper light drifter a lot and some ways that's just a top -down thing I like Hades uh why do I like Hades and not some of the other games it's it's the the range of the weapons the way that you interact and you move forward and backward I think that's a that changes the gameplay a lot and is why I didn't I didn't enjoy the bosses as much because they the transition is back to a slightly more just bullet hell mode that most of the bosses don't have cover and I'm trying to think of any of them have cover actually I don't I don't think they do I don't think they do because yeah I think it just when you navigate through a dungeon floor you have to fight uh some mini bosses which I think like those to me I think are more interesting because you have that terrain there's more of them so there is more kind of variety and on the early floors of like this mega dungeon facility that you're crawling through uh like yeah you just have to fight like the one mini boss and then you un you break the seal surrounding the boss door uh which always has this really great the nimbus is broken like flashing red lights on the screen it feels it really feels very nice to uh to beat the mini boss and have that show up um but yeah like the uh you go to that that boss room and it it just fully clears out everything and the bosses are can be pretty big on the screen compared to some of the other enemies or mini bosses that you've been fighting and yeah there's no real terrain you're just having to navigate in and out of the uh the bullet patterns um but yeah I I do have that kind of thing of like uh the the interesting level of environmental interaction is what I think separates this from me away from like Isaac and Gunjan for like an interesting variety room to room on any kind of given floor where the the I've been bopping back and forth between Gunjan and Isaac I'm like what do I like better about these things and yeah like by name Isaac just felt super barren uh in contrast where like I mean obviously they're they're different games they're different game systems and the shooting is totally different and you know they're just totally different games but it felt like there was just like a lot of big empty space that like oh it feels like there's something should be happening here and Gunjan I think does that better particularly with some of the more uh deeper floors of the of the Gunjan proper uh but yeah I think like from like floor one like I keep wanting to say monolith but uh star of provenance uh really kind of like nails it almost immediately yeah right out of the gate you're in interesting situations and like even when you are having to you know inevitably because it is a roguelike roguelike game uh with uh basically permadeath uh you even when you are replaying those first levels like they're still pretty in for sure and maybe the best uh yeah for for a game that you will die a lot in and restarting and coming back to that first floor it like the music is so happy and bouncy and inviting that it really helps to kind of reset the mood of okay we're we're back into having fun mode for this first floor you've you've you died in the hell dungeon way below this facility welcome back let's have a good time at least for the first 10 minutes before it's getting too crazy before it gets good before you get to the crushing depths it's interesting like I definitely got more of a one more run feel from this game than something like gun gen and I'm not sure maybe it's because the pace is faster that I just you know oh you died well okay I guess you're just gonna start over that it doesn't feel like you're losing a huge amount of progress or uh it's like every every run felt like you could you get through pretty quickly especially if you were trying like I would I would try and clear each floor but you didn't totally have to do that if you once you break break the nimbus I beat the one or many bosses needed yeah that that you let you go to the main to the boss you can just go you don't need to clear the rest of the stuff and honestly sometimes it's a bad decision to do that because you have you know the the weapons that you pick up on the floors have a limited ammo and sometimes you find more ammo while you're planning and sometimes you don't and like I definitely lost against a boss because like oh my special weapon ran out and now you're shooting at it with your p -shooter yeah the p -shooter which is a genuinely bad uh compared to the main weapon so yeah for sure for sure and and you you bring up an interesting point that uh the game that that dynamic of like the ammo management is really like unique and both the ammo management and the level design and many elements of this game give you a lot of interesting decisions like do I should I continue uh is it is it worth the gamble to explore the rest of this floor like is it am I going to be able to leverage that is it worth the risk to try to find more ammo or find more hearts or find more upgrades or what have you and then like the decision of okay you know the weapon I have is pretty good uh should I try to focus on finding ammunition or should I focus on you know getting health um because with the game you're constantly sort of asked you know you're making interesting this yeah like with with binding of Isaac like your your weapon progressively evolves over time and has unlimited ammo enter the gungeon I feel like you know you have ammo as a restriction there but it's not so much of like um a forcing function for you to always go to a different gun and I feel like Star of Providence here does it in a very different way and I think a more uh unique way where it's basically saying like hey don't get it too attached to any one gun and that's fine because boy you're gonna find some more fun stuff later yeah yeah it's it's hard to find an ammo but when you find a new gun it starts at full ammo yeah it's not using a common pool of ammo so which um I don't have a whole lot to say all this other than just to point it out that's like there this game makes a couple of like pretty bold unique decisions and and this this is including this uh what we're discussing where when you pick up a gun on every floor you're guaranteed to find one room with a treasure chest you shoot the treasure chest well pardon me I'm not exactly sure what it is I was just done saying how it's an encapsulated science experiment with a flame inside thank you all right I mean obviously obviously but uh earlier I'm like oh it's so clear the the graphics the clarity is so good and I'm like I don't know it's a treasure chest it is the mini map uh shows a icon that's a treasure chest it's a treasure chest it's a weapon trove oh cool a weapon trove so you blow that open pops out three weapons generally and you can evaluate which weapon you want to pick again at the question points and each weapon has attached to it like different modifiers different keywords which is very interesting but but before we get bogged down all the details what I wanted to get to is that when you pick up a weapon it automatically equips it like there's no option to say no I want to stick with my default weapon it's like you as soon as you pick that up you're using that and you're using that one ammo pool you have one when that's gone that's it if you pick up a new gun it replaces that gun and gives um if you you know run out of ammo like that's it and the same thing with the bombs as far as I know there's no way to like is there a way to toggle through the different bombs I think when my my understanding is when you pick up a different like a special bomb uh that it goes to the front of your bomb it does okay I see your bomb which of course the bombs are you know like the blanks and gun jen they're like the bombs found in very many shmups where it's like you it's your it's your get out of jail free card you you hit the bomb button and it clears basically everything on the screen or at least all the bullets generally um and uh yeah so like those those decisions to like force you to use your special weapon it's it's not dissimilar to and I think they probably maybe take that no traditional schmup design um where well I guess it's a lot of schmups it's like you you get the weapon upgrade and suck with this just not ammo but anyway um so I I thought that was interesting another thing that and I guess it's it's it's interesting and fresh and it makes you play a shooter game which of which I've played a bajillion makes you play it in like a more unique way yeah it's like I'm used to saving the good gun until I need it but in this it's like you gotta use it pretty much or you have to wait to pick it up until uh until you know an opportune time so you know you develop and do different strategies sorry go ahead I think I was frustrated with gun jen at the time because it like AI had played this game a long time ago first and I played like a whole bunch of it so it was elated that you had picked it for for this week uh and yeah when I was playing gun jen I was like man you in star provenance like I just like that decision making flow so much better where on each floor you're guaranteed to get a weapon you're guaranteed to get a permanent upgrade you're guaranteed to find a shop and in some cases with enter the gun jen that's not guaranteed and that's fine that's a totally different design landscape but um like with gun jen yeah like you're picking up a whole bunch of guns you're flipping between them you're conserving your ammo because oh I want to save this one for this thing or I want that one for this thing and in this you're like well do I want to continue with this gun that's like pretty good or do I want to like beat the boss with this pretty good weapon drain down its ammo and like use that last bit of reserved ammo to unlock this like other thing on the level that costs ammo to get or do I want to like go back to the shop where there's like an even better weapon and get that you have all these different like decisions to make just around one gun and because you're presented with that option first and foremost I think it helps to really set your strategy for that floor whereas with gun jen it's like oh well am I going to find a key am am I going to be able to get something that's better than just this basic weapon that I'm using it's it's not always a guarantee and uh I think in that's a great point like you can make those decisions are interesting and engaging and they're also like educated decisions because you know like there are these certain you know set rules for each yeah and it's it's it's again very engaging systems it's it's it's good stuff another thing that kind of goes against the grain um like uh you know in addition to the the whole you know amba situation and like not being able to switch guns not being able to you know switch to specific bombs the the dash so it's not a dodge roll in the in the traditional sense because there are no i -frames now there's an upgrade to get i -frames that took a while to get so what do we think about the dash you know I was I was kind of hard on it at first because I just I love that system from gun jen so much but it's such a different this is like where I think this differentiates a bullet hell from a heck where in Hades you have that i -frame ability to like dash through bullets or like reflect them back in gun jen you dash through the bullets so that way you're not taking damage but yeah like here you have a dash but you're dashing through uh in kind of a similar way but like if you encounter a bullet along there you will take damage it's just the equivalent of you moving very quickly for a short time indeed which is of course very useful um when you're trying to get out of tight spots or if you've you know backed yourself into a corner um where you're trying to avoid an oncoming projectile but it's it's it's very different yeah I think this game would be worse if you had that gun jen dodge roll because it would be a million times each probably and that's why that upgrade is so good the one that teleports you when you dash right but like but the challenge with that is like you don't really know where you're gonna land so it's like if there's like a zillion bolts on the screen you're like I guess I'm gonna dash over here yeah like I'm just I'm kind of hope like assuming I'm gonna be in this one zone of the of the screen whereas with like gun jen or Hades you know it's it's a little more obvious where you're going to land as a result of it sure and it's slower so I mean you can make you can make it's it's it's easier to predict you're right yeah but like the principal component here I think is that and it took me it only took me until just very recently like this week to to grok it of like it's not about the dashing it's about the like the small controlled movements of your ship through the maze while you're kind of like aiming them into the general direction of the boss and then using a bomb if absolutely necessary but like it took me so long to flip that bit in my brain of like no no no it's not about focusing all like shooting at the boss constantly and then like taking hits it's about avoiding hits as much as possible and then like when your shots overlap with the boss that's great that's why it's so powerful when you get like a a keyword modifier for your gun that like homes the bullets in on the enemy right yeah make that just a little bit easier or a big shotgun spread or something that yeah ricochets yeah and that's definitely you know classic shmup aroo we should we should go in on that that keyword system because that's about an interesting thing the guns nice so yeah there's a wonderful variety like six or eight guns that you get off the bat and you can unlock more to be found in them in the levels kind of in the same same manner as like gun jinn or some of the other similar roadlit games but then each gun has zero to three or four key words that are like attached to them which can substantially modify the way the gun works like the the wrap around is like shoot the laser and it wraps around the screen and comes from the other side like that's fun uh or or yeah homing or when it hits it like basically shatters and shrapnel is everything around it so like the you get pretty substantially modify how the weapons uh work um and how good they are based off of those keywords and as you play it you get a better sense of like what those keywords mean and how they're gonna interact with each other or not so much interact but like I guess stack and yeah yeah well yeah I hesitate to sort of synergize but yeah in effect in effect soft synergy there we go uh and uh it's so again you that's part of the decision making we're presented with three weapons well that's great but you also need to analyze like okay what key I like um and then you have the opportunity to potentially get power ups to add more keywords uh and one thing that there's some godly combinations that are really awesome when you get them because and sorry real quick Scott the what I love when you get a really killer combination of keywords is it really gives you that traditional schmupps feeling of having picked up a bunch of upgrades and you're just seeing your whole screen filled with lasers and shots and where it feels almost like a bullet heaven game that like you are just dominating the screen and that you have you know fire superiority and you've kind of flipped the script a little bit because like now you are the thing on the screen that needs to be feared and you're no longer you know cowering as much from the bullet hell that's raining down on you yeah so I appreciate that it's able to to capture that that schmupps feeling that's that specific empowerment and I will say like I don't think the game is very clear about what keywords mean and why they're important for uh for weapons because in your in your main starting hub when you start the game uh and you're in your little cute little living room with your talking cat brand uh you can talk to your talking cat and unlock more of these weapons or more of the kind of like permanent things of like oh now this bomb type will show up in in the facility uh this thing will unlock with a couple keywords and at the time I was like are these the things that I are keywords the thing that I need to like pass the first final boss with like it wasn't super clear to me at first I mean like the the wiki for the game is most excellent uh for a game of this indie stature it's very well uh put together but I felt like at the time I was like oh oh that's what a keyword is like it took me a super long time to get it but like yeah you can unlock you start with like uh yeah like six guns involving things like lasers fireballs uh effectively like revolvers uh and then you can unlock uh swords rail guns uh spears drills uh the thunderhead and along your journey through the facility you can encounter uh blessed weapons which will have like another kind of base keyword attached to them for free um or cursed weapons which I feel like I haven't encountered a whole lot but it seems like you two have somehow encountered the one of don't touch any of the walls more frequently yeah I said the weapons yeah I feel like the cursed weapons they really went overboard it's almost like a um a uh a dead sill situation like with the cursed chest where it's like generally speaking like I avoid them unless it's totally necessary because like here's the thing with the cursed weapon not only does it have some negative effect and sometimes a negative effect isn't that bad but also you're stuck with that weapon until it like randomly breaks it doesn't have a set countdown of ammunition and you can't replace it if you pick up another weapon so like you are it can be like run ending and maybe find new you know uh if I had if I studied the wiki more I'd be able to make a more a more decision but or more a more informed decision but uh I feel like they over did it and yes Colin as you mentioned uh we yeah we both uh or pardon me as as you alluded to Scott both Colin and I encountered a particular cursed keyword which is you take damage if you collide with any wall which is like just forget about it like that's like game over I don't know what they were thinking for fighting the boss but fighting the mini rooms which is like oh good point did not realize how much I was constantly hugging walls until you can't do it and I was like I died almost immediately without taking any hits because I just kept running into walls I the first time it happened to me I I didn't even realize that was the curse like I didn't read I should have read the whole thing I should have paid better attention and I'm just like taking all these hits and like gosh what's going on like like oh okay well you know I saw something in discord and then I saw that and I was like I can't be that bad I took it just like oh no it's it's actually worse oh it's worse than what I described um yeah so it's it's kind of a neat system I just I just think they over her I particularly like the um the unique weapons that you can pick up that I've been finding more and more of recently uh where I had my first I'm counting it as a as a run winning gun because the first time that I beat the the first of like three mega bosses like I didn't realize you could just back out of the room and your game is quote done at that point uh right which is what happened to me the first time uh and uh so I picked up a unique weapon of the gun with no name uh and I had a very nice standard run going with it and I picked up that um that unlock that allows you to have the little the little buddy that follows you and does massive damage but you get a penalty for how much uh uh currency you pick up from from blown up enemies uh and I had like the the the uniqueness of that gun were like you pull the trigger and it just like auto locks like six targets on oh that's three and that's just chudson like there's all sorts of uh of unique things like that where like you this game is so much like you think you've seen it all and then you unlock one thing and it's just like the play scape of all of like the weapons sandbox just increases dramatically just with one kind of thing which is super fun and yeah like immediately after that I was after I was celebrating oh yes I finally finally beat the overlord with this uh super overpowered gun and then I found a another unique weapon immediately after that called the phantom edge which is like this big sword and I was like oh like this this seems like it could be and I was running out of ammo on that main gun anyway so I'm like okay may as well uh picked up the new unique weapon and then I like died immediately with it yeah yeah this game has a it has it has melee weapons which is interesting like you get a giant sword that like swings around I mean it's very long range but there are there are there's a melee system which I did not expect but was is fun to play with definitely um this this I kind of leads into kind of something I'd like to discuss uh this is a game where you're flying around in a spaceship and you have like traditional spaceship weapons you would expect but you also have giant floating swords you are fighting robots but you're also fighting ghosts and like little gunslinger men like in dust coats like duster jackets or like what what is the setting of this game how could we how how what would we define the setting at you know that's trying to pinpoint I'm not sure what it is and I don't think it's bad it's just like it's so varied and like kind of a unique mishmash of things yeah I'm not quite sure what to call this I think at this on the surface of it it is just like a fun mishmash of like uh of sci -fi and like eldritch genres in some like loose capacity um now there there is like a lot of like deep fan lore well okay not fan lore there's a lot of deep lore that I think fans have surfaced up of this game that like the reason why why this is here is because of this thing that like this item description and like the talking cat and like like kind of dark souls kind of storytelling where it's like yeah from descriptions and I think possibly even more nebulous because like okay even even more borderline made up okay well yeah yeah I think there's like there's some there's a way that you can infer a meaning as to why there are and like some of the other levels sort of hinted to this where like I think like the machines are have like little ghosts inside them when you blow up the machines like the ghosts escape then like what does that mean in terms of like this facility uh you know harvesting the souls of its citizens for nefarious necromantic purposes it's not really explicitly spelled out in the game and I think like the game is totally fine without that I don't think it needs it sure yeah I think it's it's it's pretty it's it's definitely interesting and I don't think the game needs like a super in -depth explanation of everything but I would have appreciated a little more just just a just a little more story a little more NPC interaction like the cat who's hanging out the hub is fun is fun he's fun but like he doesn't say a whole lot he shows up in the in the dungeon sometimes and he's like he's like sitting like a cat warming himself on the on the little weapon cash or whatever with the flame in it like that's fun but like I expected there to be just a little more Scott you floated a very good idea on discord which uh you know having a cutscene of some kind between the levels like there are five levels and like there's a little cutscene that plays if you sort of like dropping down but like you just you know you just skip it so it would have been like neat to have like a little bit more and and for me I felt like the end the ending cinematics that you get at the end of the different bosses was like it was pretty interesting and like and like it felt like a reward but like they would have those ending cinematics would have hit way harder and it been more worthwhile with just a little more time invested in the NPC interactions and and some kind of semblance of the story yeah because I spoiled myself watching someone do a totally unupgraded run on hard mode with one hit kill on uh and it is it is some wild stuff let me tell you and then them beating the the actual super secret ultimate omega final boss like I can kind of see where some of the story elements of like yeah you beat the game like the the first time and then you do the thing for ultimate power and then like that consequence is revisited on hard mode when you play as the other ship and there's like this moment afterwards that's like oh that's nice but like I'm like oh yeah that's right that's in this game uh I don't remember that at all from any of the stuff that I was doing which is fine because like I think this game like really shines with just like it's it's such a fun like pickup popcorn experience of like I'm just gonna go do a run and start problems and it's always like a good bopping time for 20 minutes and I don't think it needs to be any any more involved than that sure and it's not it's not a hard requirement but it would have been a nice to have for me it definitely meets will's run length to acquire that's right uh you do not you can just pop through a couple runs pretty easily without it taking over your entire even it is true um yeah yeah and I agree with that for sure um the the end game like it can I'm trying to remember exactly how long my like winning run like they they got to be pretty long but it wasn't nothing longer like an rough it wasn't too bad yeah yeah now definitely definitely good and uh so yeah again storyline a more intense and involved in detailed storyline not required but what we learned last episode what is sort of almost a firm requirement for for me is an end game and this game has that it's like you can you can go home knowing hey I beat the main game if you kill the first you know like end boss but it was really awesome to to find that okay hey there's more there's more to it there's there's a reason there's a motivation to go back a story based and content based motivation to go back and play it again for a second time for a third time so you can see those final final bosses and I was really impressed that like when I started the hard mode um that's not only was it you know uh more difficult in terms of like the you know the enemies have more xp and you know what not like there was new enemy behavior which I thought was cool and the and the bosses the end level bosses had different behavior and also there were like new mechanics they got like thrown in which I thought was like really I was really delighted to see um and yeah there's there's a lot of really great design ideas and there's there's there's you know so many great factors to kind of work with and I think the devs have taken all of the the gameplay features and everything and used them to uh to to great effect yeah I think did anybody I wanted to ask did did you all encounter the boss that is that basically is the screen it's it's like a giant I forget its name but it's like a giant worm creature oh this is an end level boss and you fight your it's it's like taking up half the screen initially but then the second half of devourer you have to like fly down and go inside it yeah that was one of many situations one of many experiences where I was playing and I'm dodging and I'm dipping and I'm like oh like really engaged and one of those moments where when it went into the second stage I audibly went whoa oh like there were many actual out loud whoa oh moments for me playing this game with the bosses uh with many of the bosses and also uh with some of the weapons sometimes like I pick up a weapon and I'm like well what about the boss the the boss that's just called fish I love fish it's a giant mechanical fish with fish minions and the level the water level rises and and lowers and it has a an interesting attack pattern like all the the the understanding of boss design on display in this game is like really impressive the devs did a great job they look great they play great uh they're also unique too we're like very unique yeah I feel like there's they don't feel samey yeah like even the most basic one that's just like the tank that rolls down the center of the screen that does feel very classicy like schmup style still has like a lot of fun and interesting twists on it for like how the bullets are flying around on the screen and like the patterns that you're weaving around like and it always feels like a different experience based on the the weapons that you have available where like oh like now I because I had this thing that can wrap around the screen I don't have to be like on this part of the screen to shoot him I can be like tucked away in the corner and just like shoot off of the screen to hit him basically uh which adds a lot of fun and variety to it without uh definitely true definitely true I know so I wanted to since this game is coming to switch soon um I was curious since like this game does require a lot of precision and like a mouse is like not you know it's very it's very nice to have um I I was curious like oh how is this gonna play on switch and um I I did not pursue that you know I've been I hooked up a controller I couldn't get steam to recognize it and then I was like well whatever I'm getting back to my run I gotta beat this third boss like the first 20 ish hours that I played with this years ago I did all with the uh Xbox one controller connected to my pc and like it it felt really good like it felt like I had a lot of good control on it um it felt like yeah there was a little bit of lack of uh um precision there just a touch but then we found the accessibility options of being able to turn the tiny pixel size hitbox on and the laser beam uh that allows you to see like where your shots are kind of pointed at which helps a lot but yeah like the the WASD keys plus mouse like that that aiming system where the mouse you position at any point in the room and you will auto point to it I think helps out a lot but I was like this for the past two weeks I've been playing this on the steam deck on the bus on one of those you know like the the sideways uh seats on the bus they go like sideways yeah not like back so I'm getting like the extra like weaving of like the bus back and forth as it goes around wow I'm trying to like navigate through like pixel sized uh bullet mazes total immersion next to you it's just like what is that guy trying to do right now uh it still worked pretty well for that even so I think people playing on the switch awesome will be pleasantly surprised at how well they can do with this game because it's not like this isn't like uh donpachi or like two who levels of like bullet hell craziness like it's still very manageable by people who are I think you know in like the the gungeon Isaac Hades camp uh that's just like it's just like the next kind of step up and difficulty from that but not too crazy uh where you need to be dumping like 90 dollars worth of quarters into the machine um I I do remember the time when uh frequent guest of the show well Woody and I sat down and played uh radiant silver gun on my main emulator and we sat there and we played it I think for like six and a half hours straight because we were just hitting that like add more continues button every time because we're like we're gonna beat it we're gonna be damn it we're gonna get through we're not gonna let this game be the end of us and it took us all day to beat it because we're not like super pros at like bullet hell like weaving in and out of stuff uh I still have yet to do that with Ikeruga but uh but we beat radiant silver gun and like that is kind of like my crowning achievement of of shmupism where it's like this this feels much more accessible much more of like um like a nice like a nice treat and less of like a sweaty tryhard uh you know uh get in the game like this is gonna be the only thing I'm gonna get good at for the next six months kind of yeah definitely definitely I agree with that um but at the same time it's still very much channels that shmups energy obviously so like I think it's it's nice that they didn't lose that in modifying the the gameplay loop uh is is really great uh I'll have to check that particular one out for sure for sure uh some things that I have on my list here that I think Dungeon and Isaac do do better but I think like these might be symptoms of them just being like that kind of easier bullet heck mode where like I think there's a missed opportunity for co -op here and make this I have a feeling that like with the switch release Star of Providence is gonna get uh another big feature drop and maybe another DLC question mark we'll have to see on that one but um I feel like there's if I had a wish list of features to add a co -op mode would be fun to do I know that there's like there's this weird thing in like the Star of Providence community where they do like side by side doing the same seed uh speed run competitions uh and I don't know if that's like something that would be fun to do like on the same screen but like I think the co -op modes in in binding of Isaac and enter the gungeon even if they are like little brother modes to some extent like they're they're fun to do um it adds like a good level of levity to like such an intense style of gaming um I think the the weapon I mean like enter the gungeon is kind of like the poster child for variety and in terms of its like arsenal and I don't think that there's not variety here um maybe like like the principle issue that I have is like the amount of time it takes to get that sandbox up and running because it like it I don't know Andrew if this was your experience like it felt like for me it felt pretty grindy because you have to like when you're in a run and you're not taking damage you're building up a score multiplier and at the end of your run that total score that you built up is how much you have to spend at the shop to get like permanent upgrades like weapons and stuff but for me being bad I'm constantly taking hits and my score multiplier is always like 1x and so it feels like it like a punishment of like oh well you know it's going to take you so much longer to unlock all this stuff because you know you can't get that that unlock up there interesting that wasn't that wasn't my exact experience okay but I had a similar situation but mine's more to do with the the health and what's the term for this the health and power -up economy of the game set up in such a way that uh you kill one of like four mini bosses on you know each level and that mini boss is guaranteed to drop a choice of either ammo for your fancy gun or health and you can only pick one of those and now it's possible you might encounter these elsewhere you know throughout the throughout the game or on the level in the shop you know or in a hidden area um but uh so the way it's set up is that either you know you pick up the health or pick up the ammo and you get back some of that or if you're already at full it gives you a permanent upgrade to like the max or you start building towards a max and what this the dynamic that that sets up is that on the plus side anytime you pick up a uh an upgrade or a an item um you are building that that adds to your current run and your current stats but like the negative means that every time you take a hit it is a net like loss for your total run there's never a situation where it's like oh i'm i've topped off my health because like you your health can always go up and it's like and so it felt kind of punishing in that it's it's every single double or triply punishing it's like cool you got hit which is already punishment in itself because you lost life but also you lost meta progression you lost what could have been more life for that run i don't know if i'm explaining but like so just like every hit is all the more of an issue and more brutal for sure and what i found was at a certain point it's like i got the upgrades that i wanted and i was just like i was just there was a little bit of grindiness where it's like oh i don't have enough money for the care package upgrade where it's like you start the run with like extra damage and extra health and stuff so but yeah i get where you're coming from a little bit of that fortunately the game is like fun enough and has enough variety that it's like you don't feel the grindiness as much as you i did not understand the multiplier or scrap like they don't explain it to you really no i had to be told as well by uh yeah i'd like like the multiplier it's like the longer you go without getting hit the higher the multiplier gets but it's like multiplier for what when when a currency right when does it get applied i don't understand that correctly explain what it is or when it gets applied or how it's really interacting for sure for sure make sure number gets bit and yeah it's i think it's the arcade schmuppie leaderboard i guess i think when i found out finally found out about the the multiplier it did motivate me to like really focus and even more so it was just like here's an added incentive to like which i mean arguably i already had but it's like i guess it's just kind of like more motivation because it does feel in some ways counterintuitive because it's like well if you're bad at the game you're gonna get less meta meta currency and you need that meta currency more than someone who's good at the game so it's like well it feels a little a little bit lopsided a little bit weird yeah it's not the it's not the amazing mechanic i don't think we're going to be seeing this multiplier scrap situation get adopted in a bunch of other games in its defense it is also the meta progression currency for every game is you get better like you get more by finishing more so the better you are the faster you get the meta currency i suppose that's true but it just i feels less un -pronounced i was playing vampires drivers over the weekend trying to unlock new stuff on because i got it on mobile and i was unlocking new stuff and it was like uh i'm the grinding trying to get new stuff and then i had one run i was like getting 300 gold here 500 gold there and then i hit one run where i got all the stuff together and i got 5 000 gold so like it's not a problem unique to this game and i will say like with with enter the gungeon one of the pain points that i had was like it felt open like maybe overly focused like and i think like maybe it was also my mindset of like i need to grind to unlock these things and in order to do so the best way to accomplish that was to like to get a perfect on each boss without taking a hit because it drops double the meta currency right yeah and you know maybe it's my fault for like trying to focus too much on that but like you don't have that here as much because it's like yeah i mean like taking hits we it has that kind of problem with it but um but it doesn't like overly focus your your attention on oh i i have to be perfect in order to grind this unlock for this thing um which i mean yeah it's just like a different system i think i like it better here even with like the multiplier weirdness um maybe if like once the d or once the switch version drops if there's like an accessibility mode of like just unlock everything and forget it uh i don't know that like the meta progression is really all that necessary um maybe you would be more fun if you if you just have like an unlock everything in the shop from the from the get go button but who knows indeed i have to say um i mean it's it's nice to it's nice to have unlocks and to be you can have a feeling of progression even if you're not like you know progression in the form of like okay there's more items and more things that'll pop you like the game if you're not even when you're not necessarily making headway and like beating bosses and making sort of like those milestones the gold and just not overwhelm you at the very first with everything yeah there's three ships to choose or six ships to choose from and all these upgrade things and it's like yeah i mean this game's great in that you just get into it and it's there's really no is there even a tutorial there's a oh yeah no there's a tutorial tutorial slash prologue sort of situation but it's like pretty it's all basic a minute like yeah it's like it's pretty short and shoot the gun it gets you well you know it explains the navigation and like the basics but there there is yeah some nuance that it doesn't quite cover like the multiplier like the fact like how the ammunition works how the key words works etc etc yeah actually okay so maybe there should be more but it's still the game gets you into the real oh yeah yeah certainly i wasn't trying and then it starts adding in stuff later which i genuinely i generally like i think it's probably less important for this game in particular just because there's not so many different interacting mechanics there's basically the key word the different guns the other stuff are just kind of like little little modifiers but um yeah i mean you can pick this game up and be playing the real game in like five minutes without a doubt well do we want to jump into rating i think so call and kick us off with the with your rating here all right uh you know i so i i went to the eclipse over this past weekend and uh thunderstorms delayed my flight out for two more days so i did not end up playing this game quite as much as the the other two of you so i'm i'm also going to give this a score with an asterix because i might play more of it and change my mind later i started the episode with a 6 .5 and as i was talking through it i was like you know what no it's it's not looking at some other games like it's a seven it's a good game um there's definitely some criticisms i had with it uh i i like the levels like the playing through the levels in the rooms more than the bosses um just because they're more the gameplay style that i like the the movement and dodging and uh in and out of cover and in towards enemies and out that kind of stuff um but overall i i went into this game not really expecting to like it and i liked it much more than i than i was expecting um i think it uh for me i think it's uh it's it's it's in there it's not quite as good as um where's no i have it the same i have the same as binding vizek uh and better than enter the dungeon so i i actually yeah and i think that that jives with my perception like i i liked this game i thought it was very good for for me um in terms of of how how it played and regardless of how will feels about any of stuff i felt like it was a great retro at any s graphics like true 8 -bit chip tunes like with that like weird noise for the drums and all that stuff so i i liked that as a like a true callback for the any s stuff seven a seven oh there you go what a deal uh well i will go i will go next if that's okay uh very similar score um to well similar as compared to a couple of other you know major games uh this game is i i have kind of an off and on relationship with like super hard games um and this game i would consider to be maybe not super hard but hard and so uh for example i there was a period of time where i alluded too long ago trying to beat battle toes fortunately i never beat it um there was a period of time where i was trying to beat ninja guide in one and i did eventually beat it uh thanks in no small part to the wonderful coaching that i got from my then friend but now wife and um another one of those quests was a schmups a traditional schmups played on original hardware um i used to work at a i at one point i worked at a nintendo customer support call center and during lunch time uh the play testers and the call center people would kind of intermingle in the break room and in the break room area there was a there was a separate subsection there was a game area and they had a setup of um smash brothers melee and like all of the the game testers would gather around and play and they were incredible at it but i i'm garbage at fighting games in general and so i did not play that instead i went to the other side of the room where there was a r -type arcade cabinet and on my breaks and on my lunches i would sit at this cabinet there was never a line because no one cared to play this game uh at one point one of the buttons stopped working i had to switch to uh another set of buttons and i had to like remap sort of my hands and you know you didn't have to make quarters obviously it was for free it was just for like you know the employees to enjoy and that was an experience because our type is a side scrolling schmups game it's incredibly punishing one shot and you're dead one shot and you have to go back either to the beginning of the level or to a checkpoint which is like a handful throughout each level and uh but it's very much one of those games where it's rewards like other schmups you know memorization and once you have like memorized the level and figured out a strategy that that feeling of mastery is so satisfying and over the course of several months months i eventually got the end of the game and on a a day like any other i went up on my break to go and play r -type and the cabinet had disappeared no and i talked to security the guy at the front desk had no idea what i was talking about and i asked around a bit but i i you know i abandoned the search pretty quickly and unfortunately still have not beat our type now i have that's a steam version i don't like the ending of the story andrew i have beat the steam version or i have purchased the steam version i haven't beaten it yet pardon me excuse me excuse me um i spoke uh so it is unfortunate but i feel not not that i've redeemed myself or completed that arc of my gaming journey by playing star of providence but a lot of the similar feelings of of accomplishment and excitement and exhilaration that comes from like becoming a bullet dodging machine and besting the bosses isn't here is present um but combined with another genre that i really like which is top -down shooters and also combined with roguelike elements which i'm as well as we discussed but anyway that is all to say long story short i think this game's pretty killer i have ranked it similarly to callen uh as the same i've given it the same score as binding of isek i couldn't quite pull the trigger on giving it a better score because it kind of feels like sacrilege um so that makes it my number four slash five at a eight point one well for me i can uh bring us home here i think yeah playing this game when it first came out back in 2017 was like it felt so refreshing it felt so like this was it was felt like something that was sorely needed from my gameplay experience that i didn't even know that i wanted really um and i'm not like the biggest shoot -em -up fan like i'll play them here or there but like uh you know ultimate mortal combat is still my number one playtime game in my main library by like a wide margin over things like 1942 or or simulars um but like this game just feels so good to play for with like all the different aspects involved from its art style to its gameplay mechanics is decision making um the mini boss fights like every corner of this game just feels so well thought out and integrated into every other corner that it's like my the bullet point list that i have for like things that i don't like about this game is like really like inconsequential and like nonsense uh same and yeah like when i was looking my google sheet for like where do i where do i put this even um i think like its floor was enter the gungeon like i think this game for me i like this game better than biting a vizek um whether or not this game is better than enter the gungeon i think depends on which way you're slicing it from like well what do you mean buy better like is it better in this gameplay scenario or that gameplay scenario um i think like yeah i i don't know that this game has like hundreds of hours of content to it but it doesn't need it and every time i pick this game up even just to play it for a little bit has always been fun i don't know that i can say the same for many games that that we've talked about on this list but um yeah everything everything about it just like i that nostalgic uh bone in my body for nes graphics and sound style uh is just tickled pink here and with how fluid the gameplay mechanics are and the progression system and with like the pace of unlocks feels really good the boss fights are all super memorable and like beating the overlord boss for the first time felt like a stupendous achievement it felt like yes i finally did it and then oh no there's more there's more to look forward to there's more to get better at and i feel like uh you know compared to uh some other games i feel like this is a game that i can feel my skill at this game getting better over time like i can feel like oh now that i know that like i need to weave through this bullet pattern i could do this now and like looking forward to to every time that i play it um yeah i think it's it's just an absolute gem on my list it ties with enter the gungeon uh and as a as a nine out of ten um and yeah i think that that really cements like it's yeah i'm super curious to see what if anything they do for the switch release and how much more content is added to it because there's already like so much stuff in it that like you go around in any little room or corner there's something bound to to like surprise you or like wow here's like this thing i'd never never knew existed um so it's just it's brimming with content and character and yeah it has just been an absolute gem to to revisit here if uh oh actually let's see where on my google doc okay yeah so uh similar games to this we've talked a lot about enter the gungeon and binding of isaac previous episodes uh to some extent our previous episode pineapple smash crew is somewhat relevant to mention here uh just with its top down like crazy craziness nature to it yeah um and then some other games i've listed these in terms of increasing order of zaniness and craziness where the the ones that i'll mention first here are like huh so you're interested in like bullet hells but like maybe you should probably start off with these ones first before going too deep into the weeds um a game that no one has ever heard of uh but is is fun to play and you can find routinely for like a two bucks on steam is null vector which is a similar concept it's like a very like i don't know 80s computer retro style room based uh shooter game that if you if you could imagine like a 3d put like almost geometry wars style polygonal version of mon or star of providence uh that would be this game uh another game with like a really distinct art style to it is patch quest which has a very much more kind of like we we you aesthetic to it uh with some co -op that i surprisingly i tried to get will to play uh co -op and he'd not like it for various reasons um a game that has been getting a lot of buzz recently that i think is kind of uh schmups or bullet hells on easy mode with like some souls like esk mechanics to it is uh tiny rogues uh which is also a delight to play um another game uh that's more kind of in the realm of like enter the gungeon binding and bisac style uh that's sort of a a pep -to -bismal uh visual feast is called void ago uh be sure to check that one out uh a game that i'm not sure that we would ever cover on this podcast because i'm not sure how well we would do with its naked fairy art uh but is very much i think well received by its fans is uh the void reigns upon her heart which is almost like a card it's a it's a deck building schmup boss rush auto bad yeah i don't know it's it's got a lot of stuff going on moving on uh nova drift is a very interesting uh bullet hell asteroid style controlling game uh right up andrew's alley is synthetic legion rising uh oh yeah for sure for sure uh and then we can't i'm not familiar of course we can't end this section without mentioning nuclear throne a game that i'm convinced is impossible to get past the first level but again me me being mad because bad um and then see if i if i really wanted to be malicious with my game choices that would be one that i i i pick because it's it's not that it's insanely difficult but it's very chaotic i'm like yeah that's a big way and then lastly we we touched on a bit uh two ho endless dream i think we'll probably top out this list in terms of difficulty for like oh you want schmups huh you want difficulty but you still want roguy style games uh that is like your 400 level class i think in the in the genre so uh be sure those out um if you are a sucker for wanting more content about star providence specifically and you're sick and tired of hearing our voices there's a very well put together uh cute podcast by two guys from the star providence discord community called upgrade terminal uh named after the eponymous upgrade terminals that you find in the game so be it uh and yeah if you wanted like another 10 or 15 hours of content just related to star providence uh give them a look their their program is up on youtube uh as well uh but yeah that'll that'll wind us down from uh our first entry into bullet hell season uh as we as we're winding down this i'll make another plug for listener requests uh we have our our episode after this one we're gonna finalize what the uh what that listener requested episode is so not not this next one but the one after will be the listener request episode so be sure to to reach out to us on all the following things that i'll mention here in a minute wherever you're listening right now just type it into the to the text box at the bottom

i'll be curious to see how it plays on everyone else's system but uh but yeah i think that i think that will tick all the boxes for solving wills gripes it out 1992 animation styles uh story motivations uh screw yeah uh in the tutorial mode somehow uh i'm sure it'll introduce many other gripes though don't worry indeed and i look forward to hearing them all next episode uh yeah to play us
