Good morning.
In less than an hour, podcast hosts from here will join others from around Puget Sound.
And you will be launching the largest grog pod episode in the history of mankind.
Perhaps it's fate that today, or I guess tomorrow is the 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression or persecution, but to podcast about Rogue like games.
1:16
And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice.
We will not pod into the night.
We will not review Rogue like games without a fight.
We're going to live on.
1:32
We're going to survive.
Today we celebrate our Grog Pendants Day.
We joked about clapping after Scott's intro, but I feel like that actually that actually deserved a little round of applause.
1:48
I was.
Compelled, I was moved.
I needed the day is the day that we enter the Gungeon.
Celebration of our country's freedom We go fight or something in hell.
Thematically.
Appropriate if if this is the first time you're listening to this podcast, you're in for an explosive one.
2:09
Where most of the time we we start the podcast with some goofy intro.
Then we we take aim at a rogue like game, big or small and we try to rank them as best as we can with all the pantheon of other rogue like games that that we have talked about previously.
I am.
2:25
Your host the bullet king of the podcast, Scott Berger, and I'm joined by my Trigger Twin cohosts, as always.
This is Will.
Does anyone have any more missiles left, right.
And Colin, just a guy with an alien engine that he's turned into a gun and join.
2:47
Joining us today are two guests.
Two large, high caliber guests, exactly, yes.
I caliber.
Hey, I like that.
We had to call in the big guns, I think for backup.
I'm trying to see how many gun funds I can I can get in the 1st 5.
Minutes.
3:02
I'll keep a little tally going.
So far you're at 4:00 we have we have one new person and one returning guest who wasn't who wasn't mortified the first time that he came on.
Come back for more pain.
Who's who's our new guest for this episode?
3:20
Howdy, I'm Andrew Breachloader.
Blank blower Harshman.
I'm known to do some social media game related stuff, mostly tabletop but occasionally video game type situations.
So indeed, and I'm happy to be here on the old grog pod.
3:41
And every time I learn about this, yeah, I remember reminded of this pod.
I always think it's about like pirate ale, like it's yes, I am.
I am expert gungeneer Woody Siskowski here to talk about this game that is one of one of the greatest games that exists in the world of games where you walk around and shoot at things.
4:05
So just, you know, a high percentage of games.
There, yeah, there's Tic Tac Toe and then there's Enter the Gungeon right below it.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, exactly.
I.
Certainly hope that Enter the Gungeon is above Tic Tac Toe is a mediocre game.
4:20
How many Cats games do you get and enter the Gungeon where you and the dragon both are in a stalemate and like, can't neither of you can win?
Because that's how most of my Tic Tac Toe games go.
Well this is we have extra reason to celebrate because this is our our 20th episode spectacular and according if if statistics on the Internet are to believe be believed and they aren't 99% of podcasts actually don't make it this far.
4:47
So we have we are the 1% Bernie Sanders is coming for us and yeah I I am excited that we've we've stuck with it for this long and.
That we have many more, many more fun things in the in the pipe to come.
This is also coincidentally, our third Engine episode in a row for recording on July 3rd here.
5:10
That's quite the combo.
That's going to be worth some kind of synergy bonus.
Oh yeah, definitely.
Wait, what were your other engine episodes?
We did shattered the Pixel engine just before.
The.
And we did Darkest Engine Two before that one got on a hot streak here.
5:27
And I guess so also related to our previous episode I I probably need to put a a bumper here at the front that yes, we have gotten a lot of feedback from our Shadow Pixel Dungeon episode.
Yes, Colin, unfortunately people are starting to listen to our podcast.
5:46
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
My greatest.
Fear.
And so we we do have a couple longwinded emails that are that are in very, very good and detailed, but I don't think we have time to cover them for this episode.
6:01
So we're going to save them for next episode.
We're going to, we're going to be able to to to pick them apart.
What a teaser.
Yeah.
What, you think that this five person episode about this game that's ripe with content might go a little long?
No not at all but we we we did have the the developer of the game right in the mail and we have our first YouTube reaction video that's someone made a reaction video to our review.
6:30
So God bless them but yeah we're we will address some of that feedback.
Next time on the Grog Pod, but yeah, so we we've Without any further ado, welcome to our Enter the Gungeon episode, Enter the Gungeon, released April 5th, 2016, and you can find it just about.
6:54
Every damn place that you can find video games these days.
You can find it on Steam, PlayStation, Switch.
Find it on Humble Bumble.
But Bundle Humble Bumble.
That's where bees with low self esteem go.
That's where.
That's where they meet people on humble bumble.
You can find on the Epic Game store.
7:12
You can find it on Dog.
If your Google stadia is still working somehow, you can play Enter the Gungeon on there.
And I don't know if anyone else has ever heard of what an Amazon Luna is.
I think it's the, I think it's the Amazon equivalent of the Google Stadia.
Is it OK basically I think the cloud, cloud based gaming that is no one has ever used.
7:33
I think that's another awesome.
I'm sure you can.
It would be weird if you couldn't.
Well, we'll get to it, yeah.
Let's let's good transition on good segue because there is there's kind of a phone adjacent interface.
7:50
Called.
Exit the Gungeon.
All these games made by Dodge Roll as the developer for this one, who are four employees previously from Mythic Entertainment, The left to form their own studio in a timely fashion.
Just prior, almost immediately before Mythic Entertainment went under, they made Enter the Gungeon in 20/16/2019 is Exit the Gungeon for iOS 2022.
8:18
Just recently they pushed out House of the Gun dead.
Some more puns here for you, which is an arcade light gun game.
I wanna play that game so bad, but it's I don't know where it's located.
Anyone can send me a map where House of the Gun Deads are located.
8:35
I'll go on a road trip.
You gotta go to the store and you gotta spend some shell casings to.
Yeah, I was contemplating buying one, but I'm like, you know what?
Surely I have something else I can do with my 5 grand?
Disclaimer.
Is this podcast disclaimer?
Do not go to the store and try to spell spend shell.
8:51
Casings.
Very good point, Colin.
Thank you for pointing out the voice of reason here on the Grub pod.
Now this light gun game in quotations.
Is it like a VR?
No, and it's not no quotations, Andrew.
This is I gotta get out the puck hunt.
9:07
Yeah, it's House of the Dead.
You go to, you go to an arcade, which are still thriving in 2023, and you, you plunk in probably four quarters and you pull out the little pink gun in the Oldster and you shoot it.
Characters from Enter the Gungeon looks great.
Yeah, I I don't know.
9:24
I mean, it's a weird thing for them to have decided to make and market because it seems like the audience for it is about 15 people, of which I am.
One of them very much.
Hopefully there's.
Five.
We haven't gotten to rankings yet, but hopefully there's five of those people here.
9:41
Yeah, we need to passionate about.
Incredible.
Well, I yeah, I gotta go find one of those stations as well.
One of those arcades.
If their release cadence is to be trusted, I have in my Google Doc here 2025 with a with a bunch of question marks next to it I'm sure.
9:59
I'm sure it'll be a rhythm game where they like.
This rate, yeah.
Like a peripheral gun at like you have to like time your bullet presses in in time for like techno soundtracks or something.
Do you think it'll it'll leverage A mechanism similar to the Donkey Kong bongos?
10:18
Oh, definitely.
With the highly, highly successful peripheral Donkey Kong Bongos.
I mean, I'm, I love this, I love this series and I love that Dodge Roll like basically feels like it was formed to make.
This series like it's right in the name of the company, but at this point this game is what, 7 years old?
10:38
And they pumped out a lot of content for it and I'm kind of ready for them to do something else.
Yeah, we can get into it in a little bit.
The genre has definitely come a long way.
I think Enter the Gungeon has.
10:53
Driven a lot of new ground for others to follow in their footsteps, but it would be it'd be super interesting to see like what would an Enter the Gungeon 2 be like?
Publisher this is yet another Devolver digital game.
See your previous Loop hero episode and possibly.
11:10
Did you guys, did you guys loop here?
Like loop here or not?
Just give me a quick thumbs up, thumbs down.
I don't know if I want to play.
A thumbs.
Up.
OK, cool.
I mean, I love.
I love Devolver.
Devolver's like.
The the a 24 equivalent for LIKE.
Indeed.
In the game nerds.
11:26
Yeah, absolutely.
And of course with the audience playing at home, a 24 is.
Oh.
A 20 movie with the hot dog fingers.
Movie.
Yeah, a 24 is a film distribution company that distributes a lot of like hips.
11:44
You know, they have a very targeted demographic of like.
Hipster movies by auteur directors.
And so they do a lot of like Ari Astor's sort of art whore type of stuff.
And just they're one of the few film distributors that, like, people actively follow and will go see something based on that.
12:03
And I feel like Devolver is kind of the same, the same sort of vibe.
Yeah, I mean anytime that I'm.
Able and privileged enough to go to to PAX W out here in Seattle.
The Devolver booth is like the first one that I'm like magnetically attracted to beyond my will.
12:19
So so yeah.
Previous episode loop hero for sure.
Stay tuned.
Inscription downwell Cult of the Lamb and I don't know if anyone else has heard of Phantom Abyss before.
The Indiana Jones kind of looking rogue like.
12:35
It sounds cool.
It it looks cool.
Interesting.
There yeah so Dungeon takes aim and fires in at the number 15 most popular Rd. like game that we have in our data set at 37.
Seventy 3081 total reviews.
12:54
Andrew as our special guest for this week.
You are our crossbow Wheeling Hunter and Woody is your faithful corgi sidekick.
How are you going to combine your talents?
To make a one episode or A1 sentence description of what one doesn't enter the gungeon.
13:11
Well, a few episodes ago when discussing Darkest Dungeon 2, Scott, you made a wonderful Simpsons reference and saying there's very little dungeon in this Darkest Dungeon.
Great news, there's actually very many guns in this Gungeon.
13:27
This is the gun theme cranked up as high as it will go, the dungeon is a gun.
The enemies are guns, the guns are guns, the guns shoot guns, the bullets shoot guns, etc etc.
But basically it's a very cutesy sort of cartoony pixelated art style top down rogue like game in which you generally, barring any strange circumstances, are interesting.
13:52
Items.
This is a run on sentence for the record with a couple.
Of Dodge SO1 sentence, there's.
A few dodge rolls and where in you you have one life.
So it is a rogue like and each run is procedurally generated.
The layout of the dungeon is different each time and the arsenal of guns that you find in the gungeon are also randomized and there's a huge assortment.
14:13
I'm sure we're gonna get some great data science statistics on how many possible like you know gear combinations there are and things like that and so.
It's pretty good.
I'm here to.
Say pretty good.
As the loyal Corky sidekick, I will add and.
14:28
What did I mean?
And important for sure.
Of course in the game you can of course pet that Corky.
Yes, that is very nice.
You can pet the dog in this game.
It's part of the list.
Yeah, top.
Down skin stick shooter, randomly generated layout, lots of loot, lots of different loot combinations.
14:47
It I feel like it really does a good job of splitting the middle between sort of a chaotic top down shooter and it's what actually kind of feels like an RPG.
Like opening a chest or chest actually feels exciting as opposed to like this is just some kind of generic like plus one to speed that you might get in like a slightly less developed win stick shooter.
15:11
I have a quick question for you about.
Stats Scott since if you nothing else, if not a statman when you talk about popularity, is that judged now in in 2023?
As of my data set most recently pulled on Waiting for Google Speaks to load June 5th.
15:33
So yeah, basically like I have this this goofy script that goes and pulls all of the the rogue like data from Steam and.
That's that's the the popularity ranking relative to the rest of Rogue like games on Steam.
15:50
I kind of touched on it a little bit in the Shattered Pixel dungeon episode about how like Steam is like the only coherent data set for this sort of stuff.
And like like mobile games like, yeah, that you probably have like 10 times as much like review volume and all that.
But like there's no.
16:09
Standardized data set of like here is all of the rogue like games on iOS or Android, so it's impossible to, like, really know.
Like thinking back to a Shattered Pixel dungeon episode.
Yeah, I had like 100,000 reviews on on the Google Play Store, but like what is that relative to?
16:26
The rest of the ecosystem is like impossible to know.
I guess the reason that I wanted to bring it up is because like that's.
You know, this game at this point is 7 years old.
And to be what you say, like #16, like, I imagine that there's definitely like a recency bias.
16:43
And like, there's a lot more newer games that are sort of higher on the list.
Just, you know, yeah, go ahead.
Look, I don't, I don't know if there's actually a recency bias.
I think in some ways there's a there's an unrecency bias.
OK.
Because it's.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Scott, but like the biggest metric is literally just.
17:02
How many reviews and how good those reviews are.
So if you've been out for a like.
If you're a.
Game.
It's like a a cultural touchstone.
Game both you've been out for longer for more people to to look at it and see it and get know about it.
And when this game came out in 2016, 2017, there were less games of the genre to choose from, so.
17:23
You.
You.
Funneled more people into the best of the.
Genre.
I I assumed that it was based on like popularity or like recent recent like clicks or traffic on Steam and which I would assume would be towards newer stuff generally.
17:38
Well, yeah, so, So the contemporaries, if we just go by.
Also, I'm sincerely regretting turning this conversation conversation about staff.
This is this.
Is.
I was trying to prove a point and it's backfired on me.
Yeah, this is this is the kind of hard hitting journalism that people turn to the grog pod for is I need to know more numbers.
17:58
That's why they turn into a, a, a, you know, a game shooting.
Yeah, exploding bullets and stuff.
But yeah, Andrew, the Gungeon is just behind Gunfire Reborn, which came out in 2021 and just ahead just one slot ahead of FTL in terms of review volume on Steam.
18:19
So And yeah, FTL came out in 2012.
So yeah, you know, I think generally there's probably a little bit of a recency bias in terms of.
Like things getting lots of reviews, like immediately and then they kind of like Long Tail afterwards.
But yeah, there's just looking that down the list here.
18:37
There's 123 in a row from 2020.
There's a 2022, 2018, 1916.
They're kind of scattered all over.
But yeah, more relatively in the past, like four or five years or so.
Well, our our story for Enter the Gungeon begins.
18:57
With a neat little cinematic.
I feel like we haven't haven't gotten these as often as we would like with some of these games, but our interest cinematic here are very well done pixel art.
Cinematic that throughout the Galaxy a legend is told that on a distant planet a grim fortress stood until a deadly force parted the heavens and descended upon the keep, which is literally just a giant bullet falling on top of it.
19:24
Though brought to ruin, the ashes of that place hold an artifact of impossible power, a gun that can kill the past.
Over time, the fortress was rebuilt, and some who hear the legend would risk everything for another shot to claim their prize.
19:40
And what, make and make what was done undone they must.
Enter.
Enter the gun.
I was prepared to do the singing.
Come on, guys.
Kill the fast Luke the hero they gotta go to.
19:56
The Gungeon Zone they gotta get, they gotta go to the Crockpot.
So Will historically you sort of stated that these sorts of games, you're not really that interested in the story.
What what do you think of that intro text?
I'm curious what's the Will review of?
That that was the that was the highlight of the game for me.
20:14
Just.
To put that out there.
I don't know if that's.
If that's very high praise of the cutscene or things are boating badly for the West of Wills Review.
I was so excited.
I got this this there's the narrative I wanted.
I want, you know, it's it's it's there.
20:29
It's all rooted in something that's concrete.
Okay.
We've got a mission.
We've got.
I mean things are a little bit, you know, less.
I think less coherent than maybe a Binding of Isaac or a Hades, which I think is in the exact same genre with the exact same bullet hell.
Sort of like game mechanics.
20:46
This one's just like, oh, this cartoony bullets.
But OK, it's it's all well done.
And then I mean getting into it then it's just like, I mean it's it's, I mean.
Also, also just just before just before the e-mail storm rolls in off of this episode, we do have two major rules that number one, it's OK to like or not like a game.
21:06
Okay.
And #2 is that all devs go to heaven and then yeah, we'll lay those.
Barrel rules that we have at this, the Grog pod.
Well, I'm glad that it was up to, it was standard.
Very good.
I will.
Sorry, Andrew.
21:21
I just wanted to say that like, I think part of what makes Devolver games good.
And I know like Devolver's a publisher, not a developer, but I do think like what they pick, that often draws me to it.
Is their games tend to sort of be innovative and have depth to them, but they really kind of draw you in in a very sort of simple user friendly way like the graphics are of the games always feel like super clean and intentional.
21:50
Kind of like you know the way that Blizzard, Blizzard games do like they do a good job of just slowly integrating new mechanics.
And I know that sometimes rogue games and rogue like games can have like a reputation of like.
Oh, we're just going to throw all these mechanics at you and we're going to be deliberately opaque.
22:08
And like, I think Gungeon has been such a successful rogue like game because it really like starts things out really simple.
And like it's much harder of a game at the beginning then after you've played it for a few hours.
But like you really do sort of slowly feel yourself getting better and handling the mechanics better.
22:28
Yeah, well, right from the intro.
Yeah, simple right to it.
It's like, here's where we're going and here's our goal.
We are after this magical gun bullet.
I just want to say briefly with regards to the intro, such a cutesy and kind of goofy game.
I've always been kind of impressed by how deep and sort of.
22:49
Intriguing.
That core concept of like a gun that can kill the past.
Interesting to rectify a mistake previously made.
And I I have found myself during my over 300 hours of playing it between you know during loading screens thinking Oh well you know what What would one do with that?
23:06
That's an interesting concept.
And so I, I, I, yeah, I'm impressed that they're able to both be kind of a goofy fun comical cartoony game but also have a few sort of interesting intriguing philosophical dare I say it themes.
Yeah, I think, Andrew, you've put 300 plus hours into the game, Woody, you've probably put like 200 plus.
23:24
I'm about the same as Andrew.
I think I have about 200 plus on the PC version and then I got it on Switch I.
Can't get that.
Yeah, shave off one of those zeros for me because I only just started playing it.
I will admit, I was maybe kind of playing this on the side during our time of review for our Shattered Pixel Dungeon episode.
23:45
Just to kind of be like, you know what?
I think I know what?
Shattered Pixel.
And it is.
But I know that there's there's like a lot of content in Gunjin.
I kind of want to get ahead of the game, want to get started into it a little bit.
And I feel like I I kind of grinded on it a little hard at the start, where like again, like this, you know, a game from 2016, we're kind of.
24:12
Looking back with rose colored glasses or looking through the lens of Rhodes colored glasses with one lens being Hades, the other lens being like every other twin stick slash vampire survivors type bullet hell game that's come out since.
And the landscape has really evolved since then.
So it's it's one of those things where like yeah, Gungeon has like crawled so the others can.
24:31
Or walks.
Or can run, yeah.
It is shot.
Crawled up out of a mug, I could barely even function, hardly able to process air with lungs like.
Crawling like Gungeon.
Gungeon has changed a lot since it got released.
Like I I bought this on day one and like it has gotten significantly easier.
24:52
Like they have released different sort of like loot profiles.
The initial I mean amongst the many other challenges with this game is when it was first released there was like.
The drop rates were way lower and like you had to really make decisions about what chest you were going to open every floor, like you would get like one key of floor like and they just decided to make it progressively more and more generous and sort of tone down the difficulty.
25:19
And they also added a bunch of new guns over time.
Like this game never had paid DLC except.
For the DLC gun.
I believe you could pay $0.99 for the microtransaction gun.
Oh, it's just.
Called Pardon me, There we go.
Yeah, every time you shot a bullet it would take away one of your shell casings.
25:37
Very clever.
Yeah, very funny.
But like, they added way more guns for free.
And they also added a mechanic called Synergies, where when you got two items that connected in some way, like I was just playing it earlier and I got like the gungeon Ant that shoots fire out of her butt.
25:54
But if you get like the gold crown with it, it becomes the queen Ant and like launches out explosive ants.
And so like, it adds way more sort of dynamic game play and just more exciting weapons and it mostly just makes the game way easier.
26:10
Like I think people played this in 2016 and we're like, this is really hard and I'm really bouncing off and.
And so, and that's not to say what you just said, Scott, of like this game is the hardest and probably most unwelcoming right in the 1st 10 hours.
26:26
See, that's something I missed in the description.
This is definitely a bullet hell sort of a game, yeah?
And this is very interesting to me cuz I didn't buy the game until after the what is it?
The gungeons and Dragons?
Big update, which added a ton of stuff.
26:41
And so I it's interesting to hear what the game was like at launch.
I played it super briefly at packs for like literally like 90 seconds.
And I was like, this seems fun.
I'm definitely going to buy this and then didn't think about it until way later.
That's so interesting to hear.
It's so surprising that there weren't synergies until later because that is like feels like just such a core part of this game that's that's very interesting.
27:04
And it it's something that becomes more and more revealed the more that you play it.
Like I I one thing I I like the progression in this game generally.
But like you start the guns that you start with in this game.
Like the way the actual rogue like elements work is you just unlock stuff your character never likes.
27:23
Statistically becomes any more powerful and later runs just more and more guns become available to you by completing various challenges.
And like, the starting guns in this game are not terribly exciting.
Like, there's still like a much better arsenal in this game than there would be in most games.
27:42
But like, there's they're just like, hey, here's a different kind of pistol, or here's a sawed off shotgun.
And then you get it.
Importantly, I was noticing as as I did a fresh save to see how the game played, that just, you know, without any of the unlocks.
And what I found to be one of the most significant differences between the guns is that some of them are longer range and that that makes a big difference.
28:05
Anyway, I'm getting down into the nitty gritty.
Anyway, Colin, you you had a point to make.
Did I miss?
Mistress.
No, I did.
Now I don't remember.
What it was I missed?
Time.
This is what happens.
This is what happens when you put two guys who put 300 hours into a game talking to each other and three other guys who are just like, yeah, I don't know.
28:26
So now.
Let's see more about the new player experience.
Yeah, I think if I come to this game.
But yeah, if if I had come to this game in 2016 I would have bounced off it extremely hard because I still bounced off of it.
I am not.
28:42
I'm not good at video games.
I like I this is a a genre of game that I'm not.
I I I don't have the the level of like fine video game dexterity to play games like this.
28:58
That's why I I.
I I physically, I cannot play Dark Souls.
I just am not good enough.
When I play first person shooters, I always gravitate towards support classes.
I, I, I, I would be interested in Scott's How long did it take for you to feel like you were good at the game?
29:21
Because.
I didn't get to that point.
I think this is another one of those classic cases of like.
When you when you buy into the Gungeon you are you are purchasing an investment and you are you are planning on investing some time into it with the expectation that OK like it's it's not going to be the greatest player experience for the 1st 5 to 8 hours or so.
29:49
And that's OK because that's what I am planning on signing up for.
And that was kind of my experience was like OKI know Woody and Andrew say this game is great.
I'm going to, I'm going to give it some time to marinate.
I'm going to like, take as much time as I can and like play it on the bus and like there's there's got to be something here.
And I was like, really?
30:05
It seems like a hard game to play on the bus.
I'm just, I'm just going to say.
That right standing up like bumping shoulders with other.
People like anytime the bus was taking like a 90 degree angle turn and I was like trying to like line up crossbow shots with stuff and like a pause, wait for the bus to have like like even out.
30:23
Unpause.
Oh wait, There's like a sunbeam.
Like, blasting it down me.
OK, pause.
Unpause.
Like, on the Steam deck.
Like, hey, like, this game is amazing on the Steam deck.
Except for the fact that, like, the boss cutscenes don't, like, really work.
But.
Oh yeah, I was just playing it and I noticed that.
30:40
Thank you for explaining.
So you're not crazy.
That was driving me nuts.
But everything again, it's kind of a modern miracle that, like, games like this can work on a Linux ecosystem at all.
But yeah, like.
I was kind of surprised thinking back like, well, what other bullet hell games have I played that I really like?
30:57
And I was like, well, Hades is kind of a bullet hell game.
That's one that kind of like takes a long time to get into, I remember.
I think, hey, I think Hades is a good comparison to this game because that's definitely a game where, like, it's sort of hardest at the beginning and your character, just both your arsenal grows and your own personal skill, grows.
31:21
And then there's just kind of a hump world.
And I think the other thing that is comparable to Hades is like, it just feels really good to play.
Like, like this game has a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac, but I find Binding of Isaac to be like an unpleasant chore to play because like, yeah, I Isaac character is so slow and the bullets are so slow and, like, I just find it unpleasant.
31:44
Whereas here, like, everything feels super smooth.
And it's ironic because Isaac is is very highly rated.
For our podcast so far, and I think it's because it kind of strikes that balance of like the unlocks are I guess more contextual, like you don't have to let go and like buy stuff from a store to unlock them permanently.
32:05
I think, like the aesthetic jives with will a lot more.
I think I like the aesthetic for Gungeon a lot better.
And that, like, the bullets are like humongous and slow and you can kind of like take your time weaving in and out of them and, you know, stop to have a mug of tea along the way.
Whereas this is is it puts it's a capital H bullet hell and.
32:25
The I believe the capital's actually over the B Scott.
Oh yeah, you're right.
OK, it could.
Be both.
Yeah, that's true.
But but this game, unlike Isaac, unlike Hades for the most part, has the integral component of the Dodge roll as emblematic by the developers of the game who liked it so much they bought the store.
32:48
I mean, he does have dodge roll though, yeah.
It's a dash.
It's yeah, it's a different.
It's a yeah, it's a dash and it's a different kind of flavor of it.
But here, yeah, you are literally like dodging over the bullets.
And like it makes such a, like core, core use of it more so than like duck, dodge, you know, dive the other D1 and dodge.
33:16
Indeed, it's very like John Woo in that way.
It's.
I think it's a essential design point that you know, I think developers have figured out now and are consistent.
It's like you need those frames of invincibility when you dodge whether your character has a dash.
33:32
Or a role?
Or, you know, as a teleport or whatever.
There's nothing more satisfying than having an attack come directly at you and then, like, dashing directly through it.
And that's much more fun than trying to dash away from.
It, and I think the Dark Souls comparison here is quite apt, even though it's like a totally different genre.
33:50
Because you are memorizing enemy attack patterns, you're like frantically dodging around them as much as you possibly can to, you know, get those iframes going and then you're looking for that weak spot for massive damage.
And you're using more in a rogue like.
You sense though but you're using the tools that you have available to you at the time and decision making around that be like, OK, well, which of these like?
34:12
Like goofy joke guns can I use in this circumstance?
Like do I want to use all of my ammo for this guy or do I want to save it for the boss fight?
Like all these kind of decisions are very unique to this game.
That didn't really kind of show itself to me immediately, but as that as my investment portfolio matured and I crossed maybe about the 10 hour mark.
34:36
I was like, I was playing around with all the different characters.
So you have your Marine character, so you start off in in kind of your hub world.
You pick from one of four different characters.
You start with a Marine.
It's kind of like an accurate tanky.
Doom Marine pop culture reference You can pick from a convict who I'm not sure what the reference here is, but.
34:55
Miami, if you get to like the alternate ending.
Oh yeah.
She also has the convict also has a picture in her inventory that's taken from the movie Memento.
That's what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because it says if you look at the description, it says don't don't believe his lies.
35:14
I missed all the tattoos on her arms.
You have the pilot, who I think is a Han Solo reference who allows you to or unlock chess at a chance to unlock.
Chess for free, Pilot Pilot's the best character Oh.
Interesting.
I don't know.
I think so the last one is.
35:31
Is the, is the.
Huntress.
And she comes.
She comes with her sidekick Corgi, as we demonstrated the big.
Incredible.
The show kind of a kind of like a mediocre starting pistol but a high damage like single shot crossbow and this this is where.
35:47
It kind of revealed itself to me like, okay, This is the kind of game that it is of.
Run into a room, shoot its shoot, launch your crossbow bolt, switch to a different gun, shoot that one out, reload and.
Right, because your guns that you don't currently have active will reload if you switch to a different gun and then wait long enough to switch back to the other one.
36:10
Yeah, which I think is is.
Hey, $300.00 I I do that, I do.
Yeah, yeah.
Facial expressions over here, Yeah, right.
Of course that's, yeah.
And I don't know if the if the tutorial with Sir manual ha ha demonstrated that.
36:28
But but you know, anytime that a game has like a halfway decent tutorial, I think I have to call it out.
This one I think has a pretty good tutorial of like, here's all the stuff that you're planning on encountering in the game.
Here's how it works here's.
A mock boss fight.
Here's a a hidden wall even that you can find.
36:44
But I I guess I didn't actually complete the tutorial until after 20 hours because I went back and like okay, I know there's a tutorial in here.
I don't know if I actually finished it and by by beating Sir manual without taking any damage.
Again this is another kind of core component to to gameplay.
37:00
Here if you perfect the the quote UN quote boss fight against this tutorial character, you get a whopping 20.
Gungeon bucks that you can spend to to unlock and really kind of start seeding your your runs with some some more varieties, more interesting equipment.
37:22
Yeah, that's true.
I I don't know what those Gungeon Bucks are actually called, but it's like every time they're called Hegemony Currents.
Right, of course.
It's every, every time.
They have in the Hegemony.
You kill a boss.
Which is an in universe thing.
Sorry.
They drop like five of these things.
37:38
If you kill them without getting damaged, they'll drop like 10 and then you can spend them at the store to permanently unlock something.
And that's the meta progression, right?
Yeah.
And this is where you start getting the much more powerful, goofier items.
It's just like it it it's a fun sort of element of the game, too, because not only are you unlocking things that, like, make you more powerful, like.
38:02
They're pretty funny and charming in of themselves.
Like I unlocked the Earthworm Jim.
Black that one is.
Pretty good.
Before we get too far away from the discussion of the characters, I did want to mention something that I appreciated about Enter the Gungeon.
What is it with regards to the at least the four core You do unlock more characters over the course of the game, but it Enter the Gungeon has what this podcast doesn't, which is a diverse cast color and two women are the.
38:32
Default characters and then the coop character is just a totally faceless, like neutral person.
And like, yeah, I always appreciate saying that.
And in like 2016, like that's hey, good on them, nice to see, nice to see.
And like the four options.
38:47
Yeah, I like what you're highlighting, Scott, about how like you can you pick a character and you start to figure out like the play style and how to like use those the starting weapons, cuz you're gonna be using the starting weapons a lot, especially at the beginning cuz you're gonna be spending a lot of fresh runs.
And they have, and the starting weapons have infinite ammo.
39:04
Yeah, indeed.
Or well the starting what pistol is it anyway, Yeah, with regards to the meta progression that we were digging into, Scott, you keep kind of alluding to I feel, I am perceiving you placing an importance on that part of the meta progression acquiring the Hegemony bugs and spending them and.
39:27
It was my experience that's starting a fresh save, of which I did it several times.
There are quite a few unlocks you get just playing the game, just going through a run, like not paying for them.
And also, I mean it could be just because I played the game so much later and it was after the big huge updates and the loot tables had totally changed, but.
39:51
I don't know if if getting a ton of money and spending it in the store is quite as important to the meta progression as you are making it out to be.
Yeah, I wound up like I was.
I had this locked in mindset of like, OK, my goal to have fun here is to unlock as much of the wacky stuff as possible, which I think was the a misguided approach because I went in I I went into the Enter the Gungeon Discord and.
40:18
I think that place is just as zany as the game is itself.
But are there 2 like bullet shaped guards like that?
You may enter the palace, I mean, I scored.
I did get some good advice there that like that cat stuck indoors there.
I'll give him a shout out.
40:35
Yeah, everybody knows some pillar paragon of the community.
Just get the guns that you can afford that sound neat.
And I'm like, OK, I'll follow that advice.
And yeah, there has been a lot of stuff that has shown up that has been neat.
My initial thought was like, OK, I'm gonna set up a Google Sheet.
40:53
I'm gonna sort them all by quality.
For Scott Scott, I wanna pause you right there.
How many times have you started a sentence with?
My initial thought was I'm gonna set up a Google Sheet.
Well, let's see.
In order to answer that question, I probably should set up a cool machine.
Yeah, yeah.
41:08
Hey.
I feel like that's a common theme upon this.
Podcast.
Yeah, absolutely.
But The thing is, so there are items that have quality and rarity in this game.
And if you focus on like digging through the wiki and like I'm only gonna unlock like the S tier A class super guns, those are only gonna show up in the like less frequent A tier S tier.
41:32
You'll probably get one of those a run if you're lucky.
And then all of a sudden I'm like, well, all these all these Gungeon bucks that I'm spending bucks with two X's by the way.
Are just going into the void because, like, I never see these things come up.
Yeah.
So like, yeah, if like, if I just get the thing that I can afford, that sounds neat then.
41:52
You need to, you need to unlock like the C grade bread and butter guns like the the Mega Man Hand Blaster, you know that, like that something that's shows up fairly often but will sort of carry you through.
Now, when I was first playing the game and wasn't especially good at it, I thought that I kept coming back to was like, gosh.
42:11
If I could, just if if the randomization, if the RNG would just give me one decent gun with a decent fire rate.
Doesn't have to be high damage, doesn't have to be especially impressive.
Just something you know like the AK47 in in the game, like the actual which I'm not sure what the tier is of that, but something of that ilk or the Hegemony rifle for example.
42:34
Like I feel like I could beat the game.
But I'd be doing these runs and I'd have slow firing guns or guns with not a lot of ammunition and I.
Or the AK-40 trouble like the Noodly.
I don't know.
Statistically, it feels like I get that 199% of the time, you know?
42:52
Yeah, the new.
Yeah, not the JK 47.
Very funny developers, very funny.
I see you.
I see all four of you anyway.
Yeah.
So hey, we're.
Like so I I think I know like I can sympathize what what you're saying because like the the individual like starting weapons for all the characters.
43:12
They're they're fine.
They're not like they're not objectively bad like the huntress like getting into that groove of like pistol, pistol, pistol switch to the crossbow shoot that and then switch like back to the other gun that has like backpack Reloaded.
Like there there's a flow state there that once I discovered that I'm like.
43:31
Okay this.
Like the Eye of the Gungeon has opened up for me.
I got it like, this is like, the wheels have started to click into place, and this was like, right at that inflection point where I was like, dying to the first boss every time like this.
I don't get what this game's all about.
There's something here.
People love this game.
43:47
I haven't gotten it yet.
And then, like, that kind of Dark Soulsian switch flipped in my brain, where?
Like I'm I'm super big in the Dark Souls Elden ring will less so, Colin less so.
So it's kind of unsurprising that let you know, you know as we get to it later like this game will rank higher for me than for them because it has that kind of like like twitchy skill set to it.
44:14
But yeah, like in Binding of Isaac like a lot of times you're sort of gifted an item for free to kind of start your build and like figure out like okay, I've got this thing.
What am I going to do to kind of augment it and build around it?
Much less so here because for each.
There's very there's very little decision making in this game.
44:30
There's not a lot of spots where you can be like, hey, you can get this item or this item.
You basically just see a chest and open it and you give way again.
Well, it's gonna.
Push back a little bit on.
That the decisions are which chests do you open and which guns do, and which guns do you use?
44:46
Where we Where are you spending your ammo?
Sure, but you don't have control over which guns you end up getting, right?
You?
Have control over where you spend your keys though.
And whether you gamble on like Okay, there was a point where I wasn't, I was getting a handle on the game.
But again, this isn't a huge pushback at your point, but a little pushback.
45:04
I found that in sort of like the middle area where I was starting to get good at it, but I wasn't great at it.
There was a lot of decision making and like, hey, should I gamble?
And this run's going pretty good.
Should I gamble on losing some health and explore the entire floor and that way find all of the treasure chests?
45:21
Should I wait to open treasure chests before I've?
Seen.
What all treasure chests are on this floor?
And then pick the one with the highest rarity, the highest quality rating or what have you and then as far as.
And so that, yeah, I I feel like I spent a lot of time strategizing about navigating the actual.
45:38
Done, but at at this point after having played like.
Well.
After having played this game a lot, I mean the the right answer is you explore the whole floor and you then you make the decision.
And like, I mean obviously this is just going to sound like me bragging and I don't mean it that way, but like.
45:56
I don't mean to brag away what's here.
What are you good?
The game?
You you learning?
Like learning the way the boss patterns work and just sort of getting better at the game is much more important than the junk you unlock.
Like I started a fresh save on Switch and I just beat the game.
46:13
I just beat the dragon on my first run.
Yeah, some.
More.
Experience and so it's like, I know that this game is hard, but like.
Understandably, after I put 300 hours on it, like it doesn't really feel that way, cuz I just know the patterns that the bosses do and so I can just kind of walk through it.
46:33
You've inside Threshold where you can beat the Dark Souls entire run blindfolded with the Donkey Kong bongos.
Yeah, exactly.
With that said, the extra content that is in this game beyond just going through and beating the dragon, still requires like.
46:49
Me, to be having a very good run, to be able to beat it.
Absolutely.
They added it.
No joke.
Yeah, exactly.
There's a sort.
Of a level, it should be noted.
It's the final level.
After you beat the dragon, you go down and you could fight the Lich and it's like really long and the enemies are really hard and then you can go and fight this rat too.
47:06
Like they added this in a later game, right?
Where you don't get me started about that rat.
Oh my God.
And the rat is such a butt hole.
He's like there's like three phase fight.
Is there so many references to Metal Gear in this game and then like the last fight is like a punch out style fight?
Goodness, let me get to page two of my notes.
47:25
Thank goodness we're talking about this.
Before we get here, Andrew, yeah, I I I just want to ask really quick.
Scott.
Scott, how far did you get in this game?
I have gotten I've I'm I'm to the point now where if I have a halfway decent run going I can get to the the high dragon.
47:44
Okay basically every time.
And there was one time I had this one run that was really going so well.
Everything was In Sync and I just kind of lost foot.
And it was one of those things just just kind of like, you know, your run wears down at the end, just kind of running out of health.
Health is this.
48:00
This game has health at such a premium that like there's not really any other rogue like game that kind of compares in terms of like each.
We're talking about Rogue Light games.
Historically difficult, crushingly difficult games.
And well, like.
He's saying this has.
The, the, the, the hardest to get health.
48:17
Isn't it?
I think so because this.
One that has literal vending machine, a little a little water cooler.
Sorry.
Gungeon puts an extreme premium, I think, on perfecting boss fights in that.
When we kind of touched on this with the tutorial boss, but like for each boss that you fight and and beat, you'll get double the credits dropped where if that's important if you fight and beat without.
48:41
Taking a hit.
Without it, without taking one hit, which sounds it sounds harder than it is because you have like room clearing blanks that will just delete all of the bullets in a room for a couple seconds.
The the patterns for the bosses are pretty easy to memorize.
48:59
Generally speaking, they're not as hard as like various Dark Souls bosses or even even some of the Hades bosses, I think are legitimately harder.
But when you perfect the boss, you get an extra heart container, which I think adds so much to the survivability of a run that can make, make, or break it.
49:17
If like your equipment is mediocre, I think like the bosses in this game.
Are At first I was like kind of annoyed, like there's not as many bosses as as in Binding of Isaac, that's what makes the game fun.
So all games should have a zillion bosses, right?
Even though Hades has all the same bosses every single time.
49:35
This game has three different bosses for each floor of the dungeon that you are navigating.
So that would be about, that's 15 bosses total or so and then there's a couple.
Petitions in here, Yeah, I'll make it.
We'll make with the stats.
I mean Slate Aspire, it's akin to that I think about 15 or so.
49:53
Hey, there we go.
And I had to throw in one Slate Aspire reference here.
Yeah.
Really, there's gotta be at least one slave Aspire reference somewhere in the bajillion items.
I would.
Imagine I don't know what we're gonna do after we.
Do I don't think there's not, because I think this game predates Slave Aspire.
My word like thanks to Betsy, Well, there's a reason for paid DLC.
50:11
Let's do that time.
Yeah, that'll be a.
Gun that shoots cards.
Yeah, and then?
Eventually.
Enter the Deck of Gungeon cards.
That'll be #2.
There's a.
Paper.
Airplane.
Gun.
The Yeah, what?
The origami. 1.
50:27
Origami, of course.
So so yeah, so so bosses for each floor for the keep of the lead Lord your your first starting area, you have the Bullet King, the Gatling Gull, and the Trigger Twins who each have a different different styles of of game play to them where you're either hiding behind pillars, you're trying to navigate their storms of bullets.
50:50
The second floor is the dungeon proper, where this is the place that you can.
This is where you start your NPC unlocking adventure.
There are various dungeons and there's special keys that you can unlock NPC's and they'll show up in the main hub world.
Your bosses here are the Amoconda, the Beeholster and the Gore Gun Extreme Pun mode.
51:10
And this is where we've come into our first of our item building sequence with the Bullet that can kill the Past, which I think is a slight rug pull.
From the story beat that we had to begin with where this feels like the actual point of the game is to build the bullet that can kill the pass instead of looking for the gun that can kill the pass.
51:31
Well, the gun that the compiler can pass is sitting sitting at the end of the level, but you need some bullet to be able to shoot through it and kill the past, I mean.
This game would keep it loaded, that'd be, yeah.
This game's all about to say, oh wait.
Every other gun in the game is preloaded.
This game is essentially like played in intervals like you essentially like, even though you're just doing the same run over and over.
51:54
The first maybe 10 hours is just like.
I I want to try and actually beat the game and just like beat the dragon and get to the end and then you beat it and they're like, great, now you have to go find the bullet.
And so then the next 10 hours is figuring out how to unlock all these different casings to unlock the bullet.
52:11
So you can do a run where you get the bullet and then once you actually complete the game, you go into like this black and white nostalgia filter and you like play the character's past.
In order to and that's how you unlock new characters and these are all like really fun, weird references to other games.
52:29
They play in different game play styles, like the marines is like you're in.
It's like a shoot em up, like in a ship.
The spoiler alert, you unlock a bullet as a character and you basically play a boss from Lync to the past.
And so there's a bunch of.
52:46
Past Very interesting.
It's a straight up like schmucks like space shooter.
Yeah, that's sorry.
I meant pilot when I said Maria so.
I wish there was more of this.
More of what?
More of like more of a hint of like this kind of story because like the story is like you have to go in and and like rectify some wrong of your past.
53:05
But in my 20 hours of playing so far, like I I've, you know, spoiler alert like watched some of the huntresses like pass things.
I'm like OK, what the hell is the end of this game look like I have.
What's the end of this game?
Oh, it's a Wolfenstein game.
What is?
It it's a Wolfenstein.
I mean like unlike and again like we're we're kind of retrospectively like beating up on a game that, you know came out years before Haiti's kind of perfected this formula of like intermittent story beat drops as the run restarts.
53:34
Which is like, that is like the bread and butter of how Hades operates, sure, and why that game is so good.
I'm not expecting this game to be like, well, why didn't you have a time travel machine and learn from a game that came five years?
Later.
Well, what do you mean?
I love it to fix.
I like this game more than Haiti.
I love Hades.
53:49
But like I like this game more than Hades and I would be irritated if every time.
Well, I don't like this game more than Hades.
Betsy.
Well, shucks.
I wish I'd.
I'd invested some time in Hades before.
I didn't realize it was.
You should go off.
Like a discussion.
54:05
Oh wow.
Andrew, have you not played Hades?
All right, listen up.
All I heard.
In my defense, I just kept hearing.
I would never hear anything about the gameplay or the art direction or the story.
I just hear, well, actually, I'd hear a bit about the story everyone would tell me when it came out.
Oh yeah, really.
54:20
It does.
This awesome way of making making the roguelike part, the multiple lives.
That's part of the story, man.
That's part of the story.
And I just, I mean, I guess that's an OK gimmick, but like, I don't, that doesn't.
I guess.
And now every time I hear that where it's like it's a rogue, like where dying is part of the story, it's like I can roll my eyes.
54:37
I mean Haiti's.
Just have a fun game.
Wherein you're.
Allowed to be allowed.
There's no fun.
Where you're allowed to reroll, I guess.
And guns and Haiti like gives me ample motivation to to do multiple runs, different characters, different ends, etcetera.
And of course lots of gear to boot.
54:52
So yeah, I'll I'll check it out directly.
I mean, I will, I will tell you right now, and I think probably most of us will too.
Haiti's is a very fun game, so.
But yeah, and I I think I would be irritated if every time I restarted a run in Gungeon, somebody like some character was giving me more back story.
55:12
Because the production values of this game, even though I really like the art style, are not up to the par in Hades, which has like incredible voice acting from start to finish.
And like for.
Something like hades it only.
Works because it's built around that.
That mechanism, if you were trying to shoehorn that into something like Gun J, right?
55:31
What do you think?
We should rent it would fit with a mod like.
Well, I think it's so something like Hades is interesting because they've that is a really hard thing to do, to put.
A story beat reason and to have the reset and I think Andy the Gungeon does a fine job of.
55:47
Just is it that hard?
I mean, they just like they took topology and we're like, well, they're moral gods, so they probably.
Well, Hades does it.
Very well A.
Game like The Gungeon does well enough where it's just like, it doesn't matter.
You're just redoing it.
And like, we're not worried about that as like a like you're not trying to play a single person's, like, literal life story out.
56:11
But I think so.
I'm going to.
I'm going to.
Compare.
Continuing on the comparisons, I don't.
I guess I don't buy this.
It's not Haiti, but this is unrelated unrelated to store stuff.
So and Hades is I feel like the I feel like it's Hades and binding by like the two games that are most similar to this end of the Gungeon that I've played and the thing I like about Hades that I more than I like about.
56:41
Under the Gungeon is that you do have decisions in your run every every time you you get a power up.
In Hades, you are making a decision between a couple of different items and you can build, you can build a build and it's not just giving you random things.
56:58
And so like I can use some level of meta knowledge about how the game works.
That's not just get good scrub.
Because I'm not I'm not good.
I I have put nearly 900 hours in the the FPS squad and I like 3 days ago I accidentally shot at a guy who's on my team and I basically sprayed the wall around and he's like wow, you're not very good at this argument.
57:28
Literally told that to me in game and I'm like.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm just bad.
I'm bad at that.
That's why, that's why we are on the back end doing all the supply and logistics runs and building up the bases because.
Exactly for.
Us like having a mug of tea and just holding down the left mouse click as the guy digs up a trench.
57:45
Like that's about our skill level with twitch games at the moment.
Yes, I think we're going to have a divergence of, I'll say, of how much we like the realm.
Of a man.
God is quaking in its boots.
It's going to.
Stop.
Losing it's amazing placement on the list.
I'm just not good at these kinds.
58:02
Of.
I mean I can't click.
On things good enough.
If I may, Woody, your reputation is precedes you in many ways.
I've heard a tale I've heard heard tell, and I think this is very relevant, that you are a fan of some retro games and that you have in fact beaten the original Nintendo Entertainment System battle tones.
58:27
Yeah.
Yeah, that is correct.
I frankly, I don't really see how this is relevant.
But I too, I too have chased that dream and.
It was.
I I had to give up but I got very far and that game is very punishing.
Yeah, that game is is is very dumb.
58:45
Incredibly twisty.
So twitchy that if you play a certain level on modern televisions, like the refresh rate or something doesn't sync up properly and you can't play it and you can't beat it.
So yeah, I think perhaps Woody and I have different.
Interests when it comes to the speed and veracity and the level of hellishness in some of the games that we.
59:04
Yeah, And I mean, I think that Colin actually really did nail it on the head.
And that's not something that I'm gonna argue with.
Like sure.
That very cool fact about Hades is like, it is a little there's there's that touch of you kind of having to think about your build, where you're going, whereas I kind of have a soft spot for games that I can kind of play on autopilot.
59:26
And I don't mean trying to do them the same way every time, but just to be like, I don't wanna actually think about what I'm doing in this game.
I just wanna play on instinct.
I just wanna basically have the past memorized.
And cuz it feels good to play it that way.
59:43
And I think that Gungeon is.
Feel one of the best at that.
I I I can definitely relate to that just sort of play the game by feel and not getting too hung up on you know mapping it out or or running the the odds or what have you to making sure all the all the moves are.
59:59
But this idea of being able to play a similar game in Hades and and actually plan a bill is intriguing so I'll definitely have to check it out.
With regards to Gungeon, yeah there's there's not any way to plan a build really like I've tried to plan for synergies and it like never works.
1:00:16
And I guess like I mean it asked the question of like call and like you said the solution here is to get get good and and that I think that is true and that's that I don't but is the question like is that a problem with Gungeon like is it okay to be like well like Gungeon's just not for me or should they put in like.
1:00:38
And that's that's like like when when we get to the rankings, it's going to be like, well, there's a dichotomy between.
Whether or not I think this is a good game and what how much I liked it, sure.
Sure, sure.
I do want to add like a little flavor to this though, because I don't think it's purely.
Spices.
It's been bland as heck.
1:00:54
Let's jump.
In here the spices like OK so call and say yeah, so OK well you know it's just it's a matter of it's a skill based game.
It's all twitch reflexes.
I think I can say I've got some of that stuff like I I, I I'm pretty good at these kind of games and yet still this bullet hell style that that doesn't isn't grounded in like a really from my point of view.
1:01:14
Compelling narrative.
After you get through the cool intro, it's like, oh, now you're just doing this thing where, and this is, this is really what it boils down to, I think is it's it's all of the action with none of the planning and strategy, which is like what we talked about here.
But like you see that it's in so many games.
1:01:30
Like, I know we like Darkest Dungeon 1, not 2, because I don't want to talk about two, but like in one, like you go out, you do the hard things, you come back and that's when you're doing all the strategy.
There's the base building area and then there's the thinking, the relaxing, the the calm when you get to spend all your things.
And then there's the action, the hard.
Stuff.
And if you just do the hard stuff over and over and over again, that's draining.
1:01:48
And it's just emotionally, it's painful.
And for me, I never got the hook that, like, pulled me into, like, all right, I'm hooked now because I got the synergies, because I'm not building the synergies.
I'm just going through and rolling the dice about what comes out of these chests.
I'm like, yeah, I can jump around.
1:02:04
I'm killing some bosses, OK, but.
It just feels like a chore and it never really lit up like that.
This is super fun and you could like tie this back to Binding of Isaac, cuz that one is another game where it is just pure action.
But in that one I guess this idea of like you know, getting away, you know, killing a God and all that other that kind of narrative.
1:02:23
A little bit more compelling to me than this kind of 1, which is like, oh you know, kill a dragon, a generic dragon.
Oh, kill a generic like it's a.
Gun.
Made out of guns.
The jokes, the the gun jokes and the bullet shooting guns.
That was old.
1:02:38
Immediately for me.
I was like, OK, I get it.
Is that it?
Interesting.
I think it's just because Will just isn't as into guns as Yeah, that's what it.
Is I was about.
To say, I thought that might speak to you on a on a spiritual level, no.
That's that's that is interesting.
1:02:56
Well, I have a question for you I guess so.
Real quick and can I interrupt real quick please Will a 2 two-minute comparison between Enter the Gungeon and Vampire survivors.
1:03:13
And vampire survivors.
That's the narrative.
And vampire survivors, let's talk about that.
Yeah.
There is none.
You're the you're the hell.
Yeah, the bull of heaven versus hell.
I think that's kind of you're the one that is like everything.
Everything is coming at you from off the screen and you're and like there's something about that you're where you feel super powerful, where in this one you're weak, anything can hit you and it's all coming at you.
1:03:35
There's just something fundamentally more satisfying about being the the the source of the power on you get, you get.
To that point, in Gungeon, as you play more and unlock stuff, you get guns and.
They got, they got to hit me, they got to get me there first, so.
That's fair, but yes, at some.
1:03:51
You Your eventual final unlock in this game is a character where all the synergies are unlocked every time you get a gun.
So basically you get a laser rifle and it just blasts the entire screen every time you shoot.
I don't want it to be easy indeed and well, yeah, but it's the last.
1:04:07
It's the last thing that you unlock so intends if it's easy at that point.
Which I was.
I was playing Co-op recently with someone who was not very well versed with the game at all, and I realized, oh, this is kind of the optimal way to play.
I'll play.
The cultist and you who are new, you play the Gunslinger and that way you get sort of this handicap sort of adjustment.
1:04:28
And so ironically, yeah, it's the last unlock and really has all these benefits that would be more beneficial to a new player.
This is always one of those.
This is a weird game that has Co-op and I love it so much that I always want to play it with my friends, but really as a Co-op mechanic.
What are you doing next week?
Very well.
1:04:44
Yeah, because it's like it's like Spelunky, though where it's.
Like one person is just by design, so much better than the other person usually that like every time you play it, it's like, oh, I have to explain how this mechanic works to you now.
1:05:02
And so there's never a sense of like actually sort of progressing together.
That was very exhausting.
I was just like every room, like doing a rundown, right?
Watch out.
This character's going to do this and then when you blow him up, it's going to spawn 3 little guys and then like, you want to die out of the way when they come anyway.
He's gonna shoot a letter made out of bullets at you.
1:05:18
Yeah.
So.
Me.
So yes, Woody, with regards to the comparison to vampire survivors, which I think we've covered, is fundamentally a very different game gameplay wise.
You do at a certain point, as you said Woody, reach a level where you do feel like godly.
1:05:37
But there are also points in Gunjin where yes, you are scared and afraid, but that ooh catharsis, that feeling of empowerment when you do overcome a difficult room or difficult level, or when you finally slay the the, the, pardon me the Drag Gun, which is an incredibly clever piece of word play and an incredibly executed boss battle.
1:05:57
Election is it?
Is it better than as well?
Is it better than Canon Balrog though?
Or that would be my least favorite boss.
Heavens to Betsy.
But just I had a quick question, Will, at any point, did you feel, were there any points during your playthrough, your playing event of the country where you did feel just game play satisfaction, satisfaction in the game play, having emptied out a room and been like, yeah, you know, that went well, that was fun.
1:06:23
I mean with some boss fights, I don't remember.
There was some kind of a bird thing shooting at me.
I did all the and they're just like, oh, it just felt like, oh, that's that's clever.
Like the way that was introduced.
They had this little cut scene or whatever, and then and then you kill it and you just like, yeah, the strategies.
You run away for the most part and you just run around in a circle like you do in all games and try and avoid the waves of things.
1:06:43
You have to.
Shoot where you're shooting or where where you are.
You're not where you're going.
For the for the record, I think he does shoot where you're going.
I played it in the last 48 hours, but you're right.
In effect, you are.
I played a wing.
Industry for Gun I.
Have a running circle and and and you know.
Periodic.
1:06:59
It wasn't very satisfying, is the point It was.
It was unfortunate.
But it didn't.
Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
This is probably on me.
I mean I think you got this is the reason I didn't play as probably as much because I knew you two would be on here to be able to talk it up and up and up and I'm.
Literally.
Like actual Gungeon cultist.
1:07:14
Talk about the game.
There you go.
There you have it.
All right, Well, thank you for answering my question.
And I'm.
I'm sorry, I didn't click.
You know what?
That's the things that you have to take 10 hours.
I have to take 10 hours of my life and put it into this before I start having fun.
No.
Maybe I maybe you're right, maybe I maybe that isn't worth the investment like Scott was saying an investment.
1:07:32
That, well, I know.
I I don't agree with that because like I think that I would I saying that it becomes 10 hours probably before you become comfortable and before you're able to sort of consistently make progress.
But like I was hooked from this game.
1:07:48
From the start, because this is just, this is just very much the style of game that I enjoy.
I just like playing games that are that revel in sort of being challenging and but not like not like in a stupid way.
Like like I said earlier Battle Toads is stupid and that was its own personal quest but.
1:08:08
I think they're like redeeming qualities, sure.
But it's like every time I died I felt like.
Well, I can do better next time.
I I I've sort of have a better indication of what's going on.
And so I was always excited to replay it and never, it never felt like a chore to get.
1:08:25
It's not like.
I was.
I was honestly surprised when after I had had this game for a week, I looked and I'd played it for 50 hours because it was just like, wow, that just went by, really.
Fast.
So I think within within that Steam 2 hour refund window, most people are going to know if this is a game for them or not.
1:08:44
And if you're on the fence, if you're like, well, like you know I.
You know, I'm a person who enjoys, like these kind of frantic, bold hell games.
Like, you know, Nuclear Throne, Synthetic, Nova Drift.
Adding those other two games to my wish list right now.
1:09:02
Synthetic and Nova Drift, which?
Is.
Synthetic again?
That's the one where it's like it kind of looks like a mid early 90s arcade game with.
I just like to point out.
That on Steam right now.
I searched for synthetic and the first game that came up is a game called Synthetic Lover.
1:09:21
So I'm excited for you guys.
Synthetic was.
Like, hey, I'm excited for when you guys cover synthetic lover on your pod.
Well, we'll put it right.
Here we'll be back in the.
Next lover game that Scott was talking about that one time.
Was a sex with Hitler two.
World War Two was the one that was just below Darkest Dungeon Two, I think.
1:09:41
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Better watch out.
Darkest Dungeon 2?
They're gunning for you.
Don't worry, it's all consensual.
But if you like, let's say you know you're you're perusing one of these numerous Steam sales of which one is going on right now.
We are not sponsored by Steam, but if you want to send some money our way.
Sponsored by Steam.
1:09:58
But yeah, you know, if you're like, hey, I hear a lot of good things about Enter the Gungeon, I'll I'll buy this.
It's like, what, $2.00?
On Steam right now or something.
I'm probably pretty.
I think it's five of a.
Whopping $5 and.
Incredible value.
And you're like okay, I'll check this out.
If it's not for me, I'll refund it Like you'll probably get like a sense within that two hour limit of like, you know, oh is this something I want to play more of Or like, you know, I've died like 10 times in a row.
1:10:26
I'm going to go play more slave aspire then like then I think within that two hour time period you can probably confidently make that decision.
I think that's what Will says every time he buys a game on Steam.
I kid, of course, sorry I was dead set on never playing Slave Aspire, but hearing you talk so with such a passion about it.
1:10:49
Slave.
Aspire the most.
You make it sound the most appealing of any person I've heard.
Slave Aspire is great, and it's.
Yeah, I was just gonna say I'm usually not into card games.
But anyway, having listened to more Grog Pod episodes, I'm like, yeah, all right, that's.
1:11:06
Worth it go.
Wait, so you've tried it?
I have not tried it as.
A I wanted to like comparison.
Enter the gun, Ginsley.
No I.
Feel like that's a different game.
Well, of course somebody who's I've put in about 50 hours inspire as well and like I love that game too and I think that the comparison is that.
1:11:26
They exist on opposite ends of the spectrum, right?
Like Spire exists all it's all planning, like you have infinite time to make your decision you.
There's no real twitch to it.
1:11:42
Yeah, and Gungeon is basically only twitch.
It's.
You know, you have, you have a build inspire and you just play to it.
And Gungeon, it's just like you get what you get and really your best, your best weapon is to memorize patterns.
1:12:00
And so I think that they're both awesome games that just I'm glad that they're both out there and it's just usually if I'm picking up a game to kind of do a, you know, a throwaway 40 minute run, I often will pick Gungeon because as weird as it sounds like.
1:12:19
I feel like it requires less of me.
Like Spire to me is like I really need to sort of focus here and think and make a plan about what I'm doing and commit to my build.
Gungeon is just like, yeah, I don't know, I'm just going to run around and shoot at some shit.
And it's like in the theory, like I've got a theory of fun, which is that it's comprised of three elements, that you've got judgments, timing and accuracy, and basically all games can be.
1:12:45
Kind of boiled down to those factors and you're right.
Yeah, like Slay, Aspire, just 100% judgment.
That's all it is.
There's no timing, there's no accuracy at all involved in that.
Where.
And then I think you're right that there is a lot of judgment in that game and it builds over time with learning all the boss stuff, but it's still really heavy on the other two.
1:13:01
And those two things are like for me.
Yep.
I wanna take a trip around the horn or or spin that revolver chamber here a little bit and get people's thoughts on what they would wanna see in what Enter the Gungeon 2 would be.
1:13:18
Or yeah, like what would you want out of a sequel for?
Definitely a side scroller where the screen is constantly moving up.
Playable on a portable device?
No, that's what exit the open world.
And I think so for sure.
1:13:34
All devs go to heaven, etc etc.
I love this game to death, but I was sincerely disappointed to see that Exit the dungeon was a pretty significant, pretty major change and I just wanna hit this point again.
1:13:50
Haven't actually played it.
I haven't actually played Hades, haven't actually played it, play the Spire.
So I haven't played X of the dungeons.
So I I can't speak to how good it is, but I was just like, oh man, I was kind of hoping for a full-fledged sequel.
Great question, great question.
I don't know.
I got nothing.
I feel like they were so generous with this game, like it was a very content rich game for $15.00 when it initially came out in 2016 and they probably doubled the amount of content in it.
1:14:18
Through free sort of patches and releases, I and the variety of guns and references is like so varied.
And like, I don't really know.
1:14:34
I don't.
I honestly don't think there is room for Enter the Gungeon too.
Like, I would still play it, I would still have a great time, but I feel like I would not have the joy and surprise that I got.
From this game.
And so really what I want is the developers here, who clearly have a sense of humor that I enjoy a I love the way that they reference so many.
1:14:58
Oh, like this game is just chock full of like obscure, obscure references to different games.
There's a ton of Metal Gear Solid stuff, and it's really fun for me to see that stuff, and I'd love for the developers to put that energy into some something else, some other sort of.
1:15:17
The genre, because I just feel like this game is basically the pinnacle of what this.
Yeah, the best sequel is use your talents to make another awesome game.
Yeah, exactly.
Because there's nothing else that I really want from.
Like I've I've achieved all the achievements here.
1:15:35
I still occasionally play this game, you know, just because it's a very fun game to play.
But there's nothing else I really want out of it, and it feels very unreasonable to.
Want any more content than what I got?
Question does do we think maybe FTL also suffers from this?
1:15:53
Like it was such an amazing first outing?
It does what it came to do and there's no good question.
Too cuz Andrew, I don't know, Have you heard of the FTL Multiverse mod?
I'm tired about it, thanks to the Grog pod of course.
Yeah, I haven't checked it out and I I did not play much of FTL until like a week ago.
1:16:11
I still have only logged like 20 hours, but I can see myself potentially checking out that mod, yes.
Yeah, the Multiverse mod I think is like, it's it's interesting, but I think it suffers from like the fan mod curse of like like less is more, so more is more, right?
1:16:29
In that, like it looks like there's a lot of it might just be like a stand alone stay tuned in the future, just cuz there's so much stuff in it.
But interesting.
But yeah, I think like, I haven't known in my how many how many pages of journalistic integrity did I do for this 111 pages of Google Doc notes in that there's no Steam Workshop support for this game, which I don't think it needs it.
1:16:53
But I'm kind of surprised that like the Enter the Gungeon Wiki has has a page for modding stuff on there.
But I don't know that the Enter the Gungeon community is really focused on modding specifically.
Like like let's bring in mods into this to help augment the experience to add new stuff and make it that kind of Enter the Gungeon 2, like with FTL multiverse per se.
1:17:15
Well, and I.
Feel like it doesn't really need it though.
That's the thing, no.
But I feel like that's because, like, FTL is a game that draws you in with the world and the story and the characters.
So there's like a lot more room to sort of expand on that in fan stuff where Gunjin is like, I don't know, this is a game about guns and it has like 400 guns in it.
1:17:35
Like what else?
What else are we gonna add?
What if they took the characters out of the dungeon and put them in a cart?
No.
Yeah.
It's an interesting question.
You know, again, when I heard that there was Exit the Dungeon, I was like awesome sequel to a game I love.
Sold.
I had no idea, like, what it would be in my brain.
1:17:53
Yeah.
And then I went and saw it and I was like, it's not similar enough.
I just want the same thing over.
And over like, kudos to them for doing something.
Different.
Yeah, sure.
I guess.
Yeah, it's yeah, I mean for those who.
For those whose kind of game it is, enter the gadget is a pretty complete package.
1:18:11
And I.
Have been fooling around with some mods recently and they have been interesting.
They've been interesting and it's basically just, yeah, more guns, more levels, more characters.
And that still hits, like in my brain.
My brain still lights up in the same way when, like, I would unlock a new area or a new weapon that I hadn't seen before in Enter the Gunge.
1:18:31
And despite being like 200 hours in, like finding a new zone or what have you.
So it's still, there's still a draw for me, I suppose.
I think that they actually add some elements to this game that are kind of.
I do change it up substantially and this came later in the deal.
1:18:49
So there's like a mode you can play where every level you'll get a rainbow chest which drops like 8 items right at the start of the level and you can pick one to play with.
So that allows you to sort of make a build for your character and also see more high level stuff that you wouldn't in usual runs.
1:19:06
There's a challenge mode that instead of just making all the enemies faster and harder like.
Puts weird effects and modifiers in every room like some enemies will shoot a bullet every time they die or flames will come up from the from the ground.
And actually like makes the game way, way harder.
1:19:24
But there is elements there I guess.
Yeah.
My question to like Will and Colin is like if there was an enter the Gungeon 2, would there be anything in that where you'd be like, Oh yeah, that makes me actually want to.
Try it, Great question.
1:19:40
Absolutely.
And I think that like because I really did enjoy Hades with a nine out of 10.
For me that would be the number one game we've ever played on this like series.
So like that and that's a very similar game and the thing that it needed.
I'll basically I have a list of three things that would be in the sequel that I think would make it great.
1:19:57
One is a town element.
The the place to rest and review your upgrades like your synergies kind of do the kind of the preplanning maybe driving some kind of meta narrative all that fun stuff great.
So you have the rest in the action kind of sections.
And the other is important decisions each run like Colin mentioned like you're out there and instead of just choosing a chest which chest you want you choose between the specific things that's in them and so maybe have two options or three options.
1:20:22
The classic is 1 best of three but in.
The latest fire.
They do best of three often times but they're 4/2, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
So that's the second thing.
The third thing is sequel.
Okay.
Let's make this interesting so we're killing the past and into the Gungeon.
How about we save the future in this the sequel and and maybe the idea is very similar to Undertale where you have like essentially you're you're building up instead of you're shooting bullets at people you're giving, you're sending compliments out.
1:20:47
You're learning persuasion.
You're learning shouts and you're like you know some techniques are better at you know some enemies are like, you know susceptible to.
Compliments.
Whereas other ones, you know they need you to say I love you and you.
Know.
Oh my God, you.
Love that stuff.
And I have to.
I've got to, I've got to hit the I.
1:21:02
Play that here.
This is this is a four doors stay tuned.
The void reigns upon her heart that no one else, that no one has ever heard of and yet is, has like a perfect rating on Steam.
It is a bullet hell and you are literally shooting hearts at people so.
1:21:23
That that's that's I guess the game that the we're going to link to this episode here for it and we're going to say Okay will 100% is going to love that game.
It doesn't have these other elements it need.
The other two are more important.
That was just my.
Weird idea and.
What I remember, I think I demoed it for like, I don't know, 10 or 15 minutes.
1:21:39
It does have some sort of like hard asterisk like selection mechanism.
There's like definitely a draw three, pick one kind of aspect and weird Pixie nudity.
Well, I'm in.
So for for me, I don't.
1:21:59
I I find I think it would be hard for me to make a Enter the Gungeon 2 that captures the spirit of the first game and yet still like deeply appeals to me.
I think adding a little bit more of decisions and the ability to like build a synergy on purpose would definitely help.
1:22:23
But I think it would be hard for like tone the the difficulty down more feels like a bad like that It's hard to say that without like oh it's like saying oh this just make Dark Souls easier like that ruins Dark Souls and it's just like Dark Souls Elder rink just aren't for me and that's the I there's so much about Andrews and Gudgeon that I like.
1:22:47
I love the aesthetic of it.
I really like the art.
I think it does a really good job with like the pixel art and how it it.
It's got like a super, like everything in the theme is like just on point for itself.
And I don't, I don't, I didn't love it.
1:23:04
But I don't want it to change because other people love it and I don't want to.
I don't want to Yuck your Yum.
It's like there's lots of stuff that people like that I don't think is bad.
I just don't like it myself.
So I don't want, I don't want.
Enter the Gungeon to change.
I want this game that you love to stay the game that you love so.
1:23:25
Well, I think that's a good segue into our rankings segment for the show, where each week, well, each episode, we try our best to objectively rank the game that we're talking about against all the other games that we played.
1:23:41
I think it probably makes sense for us to go in reverse order of playtime for this one.
So, so, so let's let's kick the tire, the burning tire fire of reviews off with Will first here, maybe.
Well, I think.
1:23:57
I think it'd be pleasantly surprised.
I'm six on my 1:00 to 10:00 scale. 6 is my minimum to recommend.
I gave it a six.
I got to say, I think there's a there's a lot in this game and I think that it's probably true that if I was to get over this 10 hour hump, I would probably would like a lot more And I see there's a lot of potential in it.
1:24:13
I don't see any rough edges.
I don't see anything that immediately annoys me about it.
A lot of really good core mechanics.
It just didn't get that hook to to get me past that threshold.
And so I'm I'm going to stick with the the six out of 10, which I guess puts it 12th out of 26 games that we've played, you know, in the upper half for sure.
1:24:33
Yeah.
I have it as my 15th out of 26 which is seems worse than this is The game I think that is for me has the biggest divergence between how good I think the game is and how much I've liked the game.
Like I think it deserves to be in the like top five of like quality of game.
1:24:55
That just doesn't just I I just I'm not good at it and I don't enjoy.
I do not.
I do not care to get good.
I'll go do something else where I can sit and think slowly and get good that way.
I think for me this game, this game started off really rough for me, but so did Hades.
1:25:17
Like Hades, I was like okay people, people love this game, so I have to love it.
And it definitely went through that kind of like maturation phase of like.
Well, gosh, what are all these?
What do all these things mean?
I did a fresh file run of Haiti's a few days ago also just to be like, well, was was my assessment accurate?
1:25:38
And I'm like, oh, actually like there is a lot of built up mechanical skill that like I didn't beat Meg.
But, you know, I was able to at least like see where where it was going.
I'm like, OK, yeah.
Like I could see how my initial impression was kind of colored by like, I don't have any idea what's going on.
1:25:57
What's my.
What's my character's motivation?
Maybe a little clearer in Haiti, but anyway, I think, like, my initial aspects were that Gungeon felt too grindy, but I think that was the wrong mindset.
Like I was coming at it from this mindset of like, okay.
My goal to have fun is to unlock all the stuff and there's like a bazillion guns, so I got to unlock them all.
1:26:15
Maybe not the right kind of approach.
I don't like the fact that the credit drops are random and that you get twice as many for perfecting the boss.
I think that puts too much.
Emphasis that and like the free heart container puts too much emphasis on like you got to be perfect in your run and to some degree that is a good carrot because I'm like okay, I need to get that heart in order to like have a good run going.
1:26:40
So I need to use my blanks.
I need to dodge over these things instead of just face tanking the bullets.
So there's there's a bouncing act there.
I just wish it was a little more consistent with the the drop rate.
Yeah, it took a little while to like kind of to kind of get it, but once like that flow started to happen, I was like okay.
1:26:59
I think I'm, I think I'm getting it.
I like the dodge roll mechanic a lot.
There is there's another rogue like Schmuck, currently called Monolith but is being renamed to Star of Providence to avoid legal issues.
Will absolutely despises that game, but I love that game a lot, and that one involves a dash instead of a.
1:27:21
A dodge roll and like the dodge roll of like Okay, you have the iframes to go through the like literally through the bullets instead of like dodging between them, I think is a big plus.
The music in this game is generally pretty good.
I think like the art and just like general presentation is really fun.
1:27:41
What a theme song.
Incredible.
So when you get the lyric.
Sorry.
So for me my final rankings for this one, I'm putting it.
I'm putting it just ahead of Binding of Isaac and just behind FTO.
Wow.
That's my current number four out of our 26 games and I feel like that's that's because I've like I've gotten over that hump and I'm like okay now I I'm like in that flow zone where I'm like busting into a room like figuring out how the how the.
1:28:14
The correct controls to map so I'm not accidentally dropping a gun on the floor and having the rat steal it every time and like getting that flow safe.
Like gun, gun, gun gun, switched the Crossbow, Blam switched back to other gun, gun, gun, gun.
And they're like figuring out which gun to use.
It's it's like starting to click.
1:28:31
So it's it's it's crossed that Binding of Isaac Threshold for me.
Yeah.
I think I think that feels like good company between those two games.
Woody, where your other game that you've reviewed for the podcast has been FTL?
1:28:50
Yeah, I love FTL, but I I mean, it's a very different game than Gungeon.
And Gungeon is very much more my aesthetic.
I I love the humor in Gungeon and I just, yeah, right now I've just been playing a lot of Dead Cells and that's like Gungeon and Dead Cells definitely run neck and neck in terms of appealing to the same.
1:29:11
The same kind of just twitchy energy and sort of playing on instinct that I have.
But yeah, Gungeon is a game.
I just find there's there's no other game that I've put this many hours in that I also find quite so charming.
1:29:27
Usually games that I like Ryan a ton of hours into are like something like Diablo or like when I went through a dark phase in my life playing League of Legends.
And like they're they're they're just not usually as likable.
As Gungeon, so we've.
1:29:43
All been there folks.
The help is out there.
Yeah, Gungeon number one over FTL 10 out of 10 would recommend.
Andrew as our anchor.
Unfortunately, this is your worst game that you've played on the podcast.
1:29:59
Well, actually, I went out of my way to make sure that I've played at least a few.
It'll come as no surprise.
Yes #1 enter the gungeon.
Followed by FTL, followed by Binding of Isaac Rebirth, followed by Binding of Isaac Flat Yield Flash Edition.
1:30:18
I don't have a ton of hours in Binding of Isaac, but I I did get one defeat Mom.
So I played a bit of it and definitely I I can appreciate Binding of Isaac for being, you know, sort of The Walking jogging.
1:30:34
So that's into the guns You can run.
Yeah.
Well.
Yeah, with it.
When it comes to enter the Gungeon, I think sort of one of the a couple of the core things that I really like about it, and the reason that it's getting my number one spot is that it feels great to play.
1:30:50
I feel like it handles really well.
The game play is satisfying, The weapons are satisfying.
Sometimes the weapons are really weak and crummy and not very helpful, but even the crummy ones are often times fun to use, going through and finding all of that content, having interesting.
1:31:06
Unique runs and unique combinations of gear happen throughout.
Those runs was really wonderful.
And at the very beginning when you asked about, you know how to describe them in a sentence.
I was I was considering the following sentence, a question which was which would have been have you ever wanted to kill a mind flayer with an airstrike?
1:31:29
Well, great news you can in this game.
That's a.
And that is sort of, I think lies at the core of why I I love this game so much is that it was constantly surprising me over hundreds of hours, surprising me and delighting me.
1:31:44
Where I would find new obscure items, new obscure content and new fun adventures would would unfold in a randomized fashion and for example.
There is an item called the Pig who is just a a weird, creepy sort of strange companion and the description is like, who is he, what does he want?
1:32:08
What's the deal?
And he just follows you around and it's just like and this is where the most surprised and delighted I ever was in the game, I got killed midway through the run.
It was a great run but I died and in the kill screen where your character gets shot in the crosshair, the pig comes out of nowhere and.
1:32:23
Jumps your part of.
The bullet.
Oh no, I was just saying eat your body.
A dungeon ready to go again.
And now I had the added ooh fervor I must avenge my friend and now the description of Pig is how could we ever have doubted him?
What a hero hero Pig.
And yeah, so I that's just, I don't know a little a little example of what how wonderful and surprising and enjoyable into the gun can be.
1:32:45
And admittedly it's does does Capital B, capital H definitely put the hell in bold hell.
Well, this is where we would normally put our emails from listeners, but we're over an hour and a half in to our episode time.
1:33:03

So it's good to be back.
1:34:12
That's right.

That might be it, Yeah.
So I posted about D&D stuff and Warhammer stuff on Instagram.
1:34:32
That's D&D, which is spelled like the word indeed, but you replace the I with a D.
And then I'm also the other thing I'm most active on is TikTok at DM, as in Dungeon Master DM under score, Harshman, and yeah, thanks for having us.
1:34:47
This has been a lot of fun, and maybe at some point over the summer we can get y'all playing a little bit of Co-op perhaps and get you over that hump.
Yeah, I think I I have some ideas for for end of year shenanigans that that I'll.
1:35:05
I'll continue to ruminate on something involving our Grog Pod definitive rankings and a Super Bowl like final tournament bracket but we'll get there when we get there.
In the meantime will you have picked our game for next?
