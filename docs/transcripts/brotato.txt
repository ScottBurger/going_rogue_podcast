Hello friends and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Rogue Like podcast.
Or should I say because I'm a zombie and this is my creative improvised take that I didn't have written down on the Google doc before before hitting that record button.
1:01
Yes, you are.
You are welcome to get another episode of a podcast about Rd. like games.
It does what it says on the 10:00 We talk about big or small ones.
We try to, we try our best to rank them in the most definitive list that can't be argued against.
I am your commander.
1:18
That's it.
Yes, I am the commander of the haven of the podcast Scott Berger, and with me are my podcast heroes that I've recruited from the Tavern to defend to defend this mighty realm.
We got to choose an order now that we have like extra another another person joining us or should you do as an introduction?
1:39
Yeah, I guess not necessarily recruited.
We've used our Our Gold for this production phase to recruit yet another new permanent member of the podcast.
Previous guest Andrew, welcome back.
Hello, and it is good to be in this wonderful haven.
1:56
I see that you have things well in hand, only you know a few.
Walls on fire here and there.
Yes, I'm the 4th hero that you've recruited from the end.
I'm the pedantic dragon blooded metalhead Andrew Harshman.
Those are my those are my traits.
2:13
If if you I looked them up in the wiki, those are all those are all Canon.
So that's the perks that we picked for you.
I'm glad to be on for what I think is going to be a pretty exciting, exciting delve into what I think is a pretty exciting game.
2:29
And I'm very glad to have you joining us here.
I think we all win because yeah you've got a lot of insightful takes on a lot of this stuff.
And I think just based on some of her comments and chat, I mean I think I needed someone on my side.
It's always meet one V2 and so hopefully you land on the right side of just this year and join me the I guess for the the purpose of this game the the the the Ranger that.
2:55
Spams Aoe to destroy everything in the same pattern every single turn.
Not that I didn't like this game, but I'll go get into it.
That's me.
Or you could join me, Colin, the guy with the sword who has no AOE attacks, but he is fun to play.
3:13
Indeed.
Yeah.
This week we had our, we had to rifle through our listener request submissions that we had farmed over the past few weeks, which a I'm amazed that people submitted stuff.
So thank you a listeners who took the time to actually submit things that we should cover.
3:35
But I was kind of surprised that there wasn't like a unanimous consensus of everyone saying, oh, you definitely need to play this one.
So we did a little bit of curation because the list that we had was relatively long, which a good thing.
But we wound up pulling out two games out of our user submission hat for our first ever listener request week which couldn't be any more different if we tried being Brotato and the last spell and I think for well, we'll put Rotado up on the on the cutting board here first.
4:12
But but yeah we'll we'll talk about our our bullet heaven YouTube streamer catnip game Brotado which was released in Early access September 27th, 2022 and just 1.0 full release this year.
It's not even it's not even in my updated data set yet.
4:29
That's how fresh it is.
June 23rd, 2023 is the first release version of it.
You can find your potatoes at your local grocery store as well as on Steam Switch.
God help you, Android and iOS you can.
4:48
This is a solo dev effort by Thomas and Thomas.
I apologize.
Look, we're just brutish Americans here.
Our brows are very thick and very low, and we know that people based in Lyon, France come from a much higher grade of humanity.
5:07
But I'm going to butcher your last name here as best I can.
Thomas Ger Gerver out.
Okay.
We'll try one more time.
Thomas Gervarod.
That sounds.
That sounds nice, right?
Sounds elegant.
Also known as Blobfish games on the on the interwebs, Rotado rolls around the counter in on our data set as the 25th most popular Rogue.
5:36
Like overall, if you can believe it with 34,800 and 3383 total reviews, will you just put the Rotado in the microwave and you've hit that cook button?
But you can only describe this game in one sentence before it's done.
5:56
I am the minimum viable potato that is stuck in a rectangle and shoots things coming at him repeatedly.
That sounds about right.
Yeah, I go with that.
I like the MVP pivot with potato should.
6:14
Have been punching.
Yeah, right.
Weapons of all sorts.
I guess with leveling up it's the, you know, your Vampire Survivor sort of thing.
Yeah, this is, this is interesting because this is our first foray into the the subgenre of a subgenre of Rogi games of Vampire Survivor like games or so this is, this is one thing that's been interesting to follow recently is what do we call these things if we need to call them something.
6:44
A lot of people call them Vampire Survivor likes.
Some people call them Bullet.
Heavens, other people.
One thing that I've seen that is kind of fun to think about is like one stick shooters like instead of twin stick shooters.
I personally like that term.
Yeah, I like that a lot.
7:00
Bullet Heaven is not great.
Not great.
Send that back as a term.
I I don't love it.
You don't.
I see that.
I was going to say that's.
That's my very like.
It's like now, where you're already falling on the wrong side of this.
I can't believe it.
7:15
We're off to the wrong start.
Oh, good grief.
I'll make up.
For it when we cover the second game.
Yeah, potato.
I was, I think when we were chatting, you know, offline or online or behind the scenes.
Pretty rough initially.
Right out of the gate.
My first run, I was not having a great time, but subsequently I played it a little bit more.
7:35
I didn't play it that much.
I think I made it to Wave 14 and I was starting to begin to understand why it is so popular.
And correct me if I'm wrong, Scott, but it is.
The second most popular single stick bullet heaven game.
7:52
Is that correct?
Yes.
And shockingly, I think this actually might be the, well, okay.
So second vampire survivors.
Yeah, Second most popular in terms of review volume if we use that metric.
8:08
But in terms of people who are playing it right now, how, how, how much more popular do you think this is with people playing it right now versus vampire survivors, vampires.
Years on it, right?
Vampires.
Old Too old.
8:26
I mean Vampire Survivors was released well one point OI guess in October of last year 2022.
So it's it's not even a year old and potato I guess like one point O relatively recently so it it might have like that kind of knock on effect.
8:43
But the screenshot that I pulled like comparing a bunch of these different Vampire Survivor light games including Halls of Torment, Rotado, 24 hour peak of of players 13,000 Vampire Survivors 7000.
8:59
And just so I know I've been playing a Halls of Torment lately.
Well, how does that stack up the other Halls of Torment splits the different?
Well, no, actually, I don't even.
Know what Halls of Torment is.
Which is a buckle up.
I mean, it's another one of these.
I got singles.
I feel like I got to say both of them every time now because there's a little bit disagreement.
9:16
The singles stick Bullet Heaven games it is.
It's a stick, heaven.
It's a bullet.
There you go.
Yeah.
So Potato 13,000 Vampire Survivor 7000.
Halls of Torment 5000.
Well, I guess you could you could round it up to six houses 5.8 thousand.
9:35
But yeah, Halls of Torment is like is what if vampire Survivors but Diablo 1 graphics.
Yeah.
That's actually, you know what that sounds about right?
See like you say but like it has that kind of like like janky wholesomeness to the Sprite work that like that you see in like the Diablo one Butcher and like all of that kind of like like dark like MS-DOS early 90s aesthetic.
10:07
It's interesting and like it's it's also interesting in that it defaults to like it's like by default a twin stick shooter slash hacking slash bullet heaven question mark.
But there's some options that you can select to just like yeah, just just do the auto aiming and auto attacking for me please.
10:25
And I think I kind of prefer it that way.
But anyway.
We can't.
Yeah, we can't.
Well, good.
Aesthetic good aesthetics.
Speaking of aesthetics, I find potatoes aesthetic a little.
Puzzling.
Personally, it kind of has a a very flash game esque look to it, which I guess there is a certain soft spot in my heart for that.
10:49
But yeah, I don't know, I just, I I find the I find the the artwork to be a little puzzling.
The other part of the aesthetic and and sort of look and feel of the game, the sound is great and the feedback I feel like is really great.
And like, it feels good to clear a screen and to to take out enemies and everything.
11:09
Yeah, I don't know.
What do you what do you all think of the art direction?
I think for me this is my only bad bullet point for this game is that the aesthetic is like virtually nonexistent.
And I think that like this game I think gets gets a little bit of defense with it being a solo dev effort and the game being $5.
11:33
But at the same time like basically all these other vampire survivor like games that I have on like this popularity screenshot here are also $5.00 so I don't know like like Vampire survivors also $5 Bone Raiser Minions less than that 20 minutes till dawn less about the same halls of format $5.
11:54
Like, I think this this game benefits a lot from being from that first mover effect of like Vampire survivors, like really good Rotado.
Like the first one to be kind of like directly inspired by that maybe.
12:12
Interesting.
I mean I was it's just it's the case that like, so with Binding of Isaac, I mean like that was a Flash game right to begin with.
And so, like, we can't say that like because it has those graphics that is bad.
In fact, you know?
My luck be a landlord.
My number one game has the graphics of a potato of sorts here.
12:30
Yes, but.
It's pixel potato which I like Pixel.
Potato is nice.
I mean, it's different.
Yeah, potato.
Potato now, dude.
When you say that it's a solo dev, like literally this dev did everything, including the art, I mean, I believe it because I think that.
12:49
Well, that almost.
I didn't.
I didn't consider that so.
Well, obviously if it's one, if it's a single dev, then they the single dev had to do the artwork.
In which case, I don't know.
That almost like ranks it up in my mind.
Like, OK, all right, I can dig it.
I also, I feel like I did.
I did.
I did some spying on some of the other games that that I've already I've already.
13:08
Not only did I butcher his name that I forgot it 5 seconds later I can the least I can do that Thomas Thomas has developed for us here, like he's developed some other ironically potato themed games that also have like a very similar kind of art art style to them.
13:26
So I can 100% see like, oh he's just like he's just rolling with that same aesthetic, which is fine, but I feel like, I feel like there's a divorce between like aesthetic and theme here and like the game has like an aesthetic kind of, but there's no theme.
13:44
Does that make sense?
Oh, interesting point.
Yeah, I, into the gun had like guns and everything was gun based, whereas like this one is like, oh you're a potato with guns and melee weapons and like you shouldn't you like what's it?
What would a potato a potato should uh.
14:01
I don't know.
Have a ketchup and and and salt shake.
I don't know, like how you're a weapon out of that stuff, but.
Play on like Mr. Potato Head, like you're attaching different things to your potato.
That's good.
I didn't care.
I didn't care that there wasn't like an aesthetic for the weapons and stuff.
14:17
What I didn't like was that all of the enemies kind of look, Samy, they're all purple, sure, And they're all kind of blobby.
And so you're just like, it's just like a wave of purple gooish kind of thing coming at you.
14:35
It's hard.
It kind of hard to differentiate.
It got it gets like at a certain point you just kind of like defocus your eyes and just like run away from the swarm.
And I was like, oh, there's how many different kinds of things that you don't.
It's just they're very much the same.
14:53
Like, I'm now I'm looking at the wiki.
And then like some of these things are like, oh, they had like special things they did.
It's like, well, I wouldn't have known.
I mean, I didn't play it very much, but I literally couldn't have known because there's just like, oh, it died and it spawned three more like, well, they were immediately just like part of the the Swarm.
15:10
Of board of Monsters that have it out for potatoes.
Yeah, well, I upon once I started getting into more runs.
I feel like I was getting a decent sense, like Okay, that's the charging guy, Okay, that's the guy with more health.
15:25
Okay, that's the guy who shoots A projectile.
And yes, since we're now sort of talking about the gameplay, I feel like is my experience with the very super brief time with this game that there's a little more of a focus on movement than something like vampire survivors, which I did appreciate from like a sort of twitchy.
15:49
Bullet hell type perspective.
Like I was enjoying kind of dipping and dodging around, but what I didn't like is the fact that and this maybe changes as you go on further, I only got to weigh 14, but what I did not like is that you're stuck in a square arena and I was really much.
16:06
I was so looking forward to exploring a potato scape of some kind.
There's none to be had.
And that's something in Vampire survivors that I really.
Like which is and you can't.
Lowering the level there, I say it's not really.
Explanation, but going around traversing the level, I feel like in some ways it's an opposite criticism.
16:23
But I wish that you could have zoomed out further so you could could have seen the whole thing because like kept being like, well, I'm going to run up here and then I'd like start running and like, oh, there were a bunch of enemies that were just off the edge because I felt like the zoom distance wasn't far enough out.
16:40
So like.
As part of a well we we got to pretend that we're in a larger area.
It's better make sure that the the zooms quite zoomed in.
You guys just touched on like the two things that were like top of mind that I that were some of the worst parts about this like being like in the beginning I said they're you're trapped in a rectangle because that just stood out to me as like this is so weird as someone who.
17:02
Has played all these other vampire survivors like games like yeah there there's like these really interesting like like landscapes and you're exploring and like sometimes there's like maybe there's like a you know a top and bottom border or like is there was a diagonal and like but or in some cases like with vampire survivors like almost like a maze like labyrinth that you're like exploring and like that's interesting and it's also zoomed out for their so you can like plan your way through a little better And this just felt so like.
17:27
It feels like it takes a dimension, dimensionality of the game and really reduces it down until like what Collins, that which is just avoid the Swarm which I know that's kind of like the basis of these games but it just felt so much more basic.
Yeah, there's two.
There's two kind of interesting comparisons to this, both of which I I'm almost certain no one else here has played, but Super stay tunes that have that kind of fixed square like Arena and one.
17:54
And like, I almost think that, like, Rotado is not a vampire survivor.
Like, it's a Crimson Lands, like and Crimson lands like again, Yeah, the facial expression of bemusement is justified because this is a game that, like, it routinely goes on sale for like, I don't know, a dollar like once every so often.
18:12
But like I caught it on sale finally because otherwise it's like 15 bucks and I'm like I'll wait and it is very much like that is a is a fixed square arena all the enemies kind of look bobular in the same but I feel like that one is more interesting just because like it's aesthetic is like very much more Starship troopery doom style bugs.
18:35
We got bugs and we got to like, kill them all.
I'm from Buenos Aires kind of thing versus this which like if if there was like plans for the game to like lean more into like potato puns, like I'd be all over it.
18:51
Like there.
It doesn't feel like there's a kind of theme here to kind of draw me back in.
And again like we're criticizing a game made by one person that's $5.
Like how I don't know how much.
Like we.
Can I think we can?
We can criticize whatever we want here.
I don't think the fact that it's one person.
19:07
Like I'm just interested in fun games, fundamentally fun games.
If it's one person 100, I don't care.
Yeah, and I think this game is fun.
Like I think this game is fun to like play in short bursts when like I just like I'm done thinking for the day.
Like I don't want to think about anything else.
19:23
I just want to like run a little egg shaped potato man that can wield 6 guns at a time in an arena and like maybe draw landmines and have things explode for 5 minutes like.
I'll say I was pleasantly surprised.
Pleasantly surprised.
I basically didn't play this game because.
19:39
You guys made it sound bad, and so I played it for like an hour this afternoon before we started podcasting, and I had a good time playing it.
I didn't like the aesthetic, but I did kind of have fun playing it.
Sure.
Yeah.
No, certainly I was having more fun as the more I played it.
19:59
So, which is a great, great sign.
I mean for any game and I think with a little bit of time that I played it, it's yeah, I think I get why it is.
I played it from Scott Steam Library and one of the questions was absolutely going to be how much does this game cost?
20:15
Because if it was more than $5 then it'd be okay, the value per dollar goes down.
But for 5 bucks, like, I don't know, play for an hour or two, you've got your money's worth.
Yeah, this would be a super solid game to like put put on in like, I don't know, you have like.
20:35
Some people over the brewskis are out and you're just like passing the controller.
Maybe some potato vodka?
Like potato skins stuffed with flaming brass knuckles.
And Yep, and mines.
We've kind of danced around to the intense story behind this game.
20:56
Right, I was about to ask.
Is there an intro?
No, but so so the rug pole here is that I found the Nintendo Switch eShop description which the game none of which is evident from the game but like here we go, if there was more, if there was more about this, I feel like it would be like okay like you, you have me hooked.
21:19
So the Nintendo Switch ESOP eShop description reads as a spaceship from potato world crashes onto an alien planet.
The sole survivor.
Brotato.
The only potato capable of handling 6 weapons at the same time, waiting to be rescued by his mates.
21:35
Rotato must survive in this hostile environment.
Oh, OK, now what is I?
Who did what?
Intern at Nintendo wrote that like, oh shoot, we didn't get a blurb from like, is that even true?
That's Or did someone like from Nintendo make that up?
21:51
Because they're like, I've got to have something.
Yeah, definitely ChatGPT generated, right?
There, you know, hey, that motivates me a bit more to play it.
And I feel like if there was just a little bit of that in like the UI like oh, here's the here's the rescue ship and it's getting closer Like I I feel like that would.
22:07
I think that would add something to this.
I think this game needs not.
I think this game needs any.
Any extra story would be annoying in my opinion, because it's not going to be enough to be like a good story.
I feel like zero flavor whatsoever would have been just like pure mechanics.
22:27
Sure, that's basically what Vampire Survivor is like.
What story is there in Vampire Survivor?
Yeah, there's a.
The flavor is.
I mean like vampire if.
You're going to spend surviving in a vampire hellscape, and if you're going to spend time on external things, spend time on the the art flavor.
22:47
Don't give it a story about Potato World.
I don't care about Potato World.
You're not gonna invest me in your story.
I'm already beat up, Blue Doo.
I'm feeling it.
I want this potato world to happen now, like I just like you are.
What's the economy like in the potato world like?
What's the government like society?
23:04
How do How do the potatoes?
So our next game here?
Yeah, I think honestly, like, do we want to move on to last spell?
I think I pretty much covered all of theirs.
There's the potato.
Yeah, we we can come back to Potato for when we talk about final rankings I think.
23:20
But but yeah our our second game from Listener request week thankfully is the Siege of Gondor Simulator.
The last spell released 1.0 this again this year March 9th 2023 but released an early access June 3rd 2021.
23:37
You can find this on Steam, the Switch, and PS4 and PS5.
This is a game developed by Ishtar Games, also based in in France, in the Bordeaux region and the Lilay region.
23:54
Someone that's right next to Rube.
Everyone knows they are well known for their Dead in dot dot dot series.
They develop some games called Dead in Bermuda, Dead in Vinland, then the last spell, and they have a new game also out this year called Lakeburg Legacies, which.
24:12
Seems interesting?
This is published by the arcade crew who have published such notable titles as Blazing Chrome, Kunai Infernax, which looks interesting and a a kind of near and dear aesthetically to my heart.
24:31
Any kind of Mega Drive Master System side scrolling ninja slash.
Robot game, Vengeful Guardian Moon Rider, which I think also has the same soundtrack artist as this game, which we'll get into in a minute.
24:50
The last spell rolls in on our data set is the 91st most popular roadlight game with 8387 reviews.
Andrew, what's our one sentence?
Description of the last spell before the waves of rob zombies spill over the Haven walls?
25:09
Check it out.
You're going to be riding in your dragula through waves of enemies while you're defending a city.
You you.
It is a a tactical turn based, yeah turn based tactical combat game with some arch PG elements.
25:30
It's definitely Rogue Light Light as opposed to Rogue like and it.
Is golly, I would.
I would have prepared something.
You know.
25:45
It's it's because I unless it's less of a sentence thing that I want to describe it as more of a bullet pointed list.
It's like yo, it's tower defense, it's turn based tactical game.
It's sort of old school grid based RPG combat and it's got this really just like.
26:04
Ripping like metal aesthetic to it that I am all about it's it really speaks to me on like a power level, epic poem level.
Ripping those power chords.
It's our defense game where you're the towers.
26:24
Sort of, yeah.
Yeah.
It's supposed you're the most powerful and and, you know, interesting of the towers.
Indeed, yeah.
What did I miss?
Anything with my description?
I mean, no.
26:39
Yeah, I think that'll I covered it.
I think that'll cover it.
Yeah.
I mean, there's the narrative element to it that's kind of outside of like, yeah, the.
Potato World I forgot.
Yeah, it's.
Not in the potato world.
I mean, we don't know that.
Is that where we want to start?
26:55
I mean the game to start with a an intro.
Cinematic.
I think it's the intro cinematic to this game is like otherworldly compared to again Rotato.
It has.
It has heart, but the last spell I think has budget behind it and boy do you see it with this kind of intro cinematic this 4 minute long.
27:20
Pixel art feast for the eyes that kind of gives you.
I mean I won't I'll encourage people to go and and watch the intro video just to kind of whet their appetite about how this, this game is set up.
But it I feel like the TLDR version of this of this intro is it is medieval Oppenheimer and you're effectively trying to reduce or reverse the magic of the atom bomb.
27:49
Called Magic from the world, Yeah.
No.
It's a great interest in cinematic and the music fucking slaps.
It's like, yeah, and the.
Sound design in general.
Very good, Yeah.
So I thought you said.
28:04
They've got budget behind this.
I feel like I don't know even if there was that much money spent in the introduction cinematic, Like I feel like there's not a whole ton of animation.
But like the way that they gave it life and movement was super impressive and like the music but also just like the sound effects and everything were like super intense, super great.
28:27
I mean I'm not trying to knock the the intro, there's definitely a lot of time and effort went into it, but like I feel like it was very efficiently done also, which I was impressed by.
But yeah, as you say, this is definitely a post apocalyptic game.
Like the medieval fantasy, medieval kingdoms of the world all got ahold of this special super powerful purple magic atom bomb magic and used it on each other and the world is covered in this purple.
28:57
Magic Fallout Mist.
This nuclear fallout that has basically destroyed most of the the world and has mutated all of the creatures throughout the realm into horrible mutated zombie like beasts and monsters.
And is it up?
It is up to a select number of these little pockets of surviving strongholds that are trying to cast a banishment spell to to end this, which is I also I think is an interesting concept, like the ultimate goal of this game, this fantasy game.
29:27
Is to bring an end to the fantasy, is to the end.
Goal is to stop magic.
Is to get rid of it.
Because we can do zombies.
I'll share that too.
Counter spell.
Yeah, like this game I think really, really starts very strong.
29:46
You have your kind of.
Forced tutorial sequence that you're guaranteed to lose.
So that way you know like, oh this is this is basically the life cycle of the game where you learn all these at at first, seemingly bamboozlingly huge amount of concepts and you're overwhelmed by by zombies.
30:10
You have a little Fort to secure and you you have some ages who are desperately trying to.
Gather their magic.
Energy to produce the last spell and then you lose as you do, or my case as you do numerous times.
30:28
And then you are you are brought forth to meet these two mysterious gods, Goddesses.
The gods of meta progression greet you and offer you a purple kind of meta progression and a gold type of meta progression.
30:47
And they introduce you to your goal of okay.
You know you're you're here, there's multiple timelines, and you know everything is wibbly wobbly in this world.
And your goal is to go into these these different havens and try to hold off the zombie hordes long enough to have the mages.
31:05
Erect the last spell.
And dispel all of the magic.
And yeah, how?
Do we want to jump into this game?
This feels it feels like there's a lot going on here.
We can.
I think we can talk through.
Like some of the mechanics 1st and then kind of get into how we feel about it.
31:20
Cuz I think that like, I mean you're like you're right.
Like you start the game, you got, you just got the you saw the intro you're super hyped on.
Like yeah, I gotta stop the zombies that I can save, you know the arm ages while they cast this, the break the seal or whatever and there's like, I don't know how many in total that you need to do but.
31:36
You've got these heroes essentially that you're assigned and they have different classes, kind of typical RPG classes.
The warrior, the Ranger, the mage, I think those are the three that you start with.
And basically the town's there in the middle and you got, you can see that, OK, zombies going to come from these sides go.
31:53
And there's essentially three, I think different phases in the game.
One is like the, the building phase or excuse me, like town phase.
Yeah, 2 1/2, yeah.
Like where you're, you've got a a city in ruins and you can like, you know, destroy things.
32:08
There's all kinds of currencies, like villagers or currencies.
You can take things down, build them up, all kinds of ends and things that produce all kinds of resources.
So ultimately what you're doing is you're spending a lot of time trying to set up like your town, then you want to build some defenses around it.
So that's another kind of big elements is like, okay, you got a town.
32:26
Now find some way of defending it with the things that you have and then finally get to the phase where you're like, okay, here's your characters, position them and then hit go.
And then that's when you kind of enter the next big phase kind of goes from this pause.
Sort of two.
And 1/2 or three phase thing the daytime.
32:41
Period The daytime, Yeah, Yeah, right.
Then it goes into the nighttime where the zombies attack and that's when it turns to that very tactical turn based sort of.
Time consuming time could Oh yeah.
I mean like do we want to get to that already?
Maybe not just yet, yeah, no.
32:57
But like that's essentially.
The format, you're gonna do this back and forth over the course of, like, I don't know, seven or nine different nights until finally the the seal is broken and all while you're leveling up it's RPG elements all around.
And that's kind of like the gist of the mechanics here, unless I'm forgetting something.
I mean, you're.
33:13
Forgetting the very.
Crucial part of this game where you will inevitably be interrupted by something very important every 5 minutes into a segment of playing this game and you're like, Oh my God, what was I doing before?
Like I feel like this game I have to like carve out a weekend to just like grind out one town like it.
33:33
It feels so, so thinky and involved and I mean, I'll I'll start with the my so I really liked this game but it took a long time to get through each run.
33:50
Like I beat the second town and that's kind of where I'm like I I've played enough of this game and it took me that run, took me 10 hours.
Well, 12 nights in that in the village and it took me 10 hours and I got to check my screenshots.
34:07
Did you beat?
Did you beat the second town?
I did last night and the Steam library was locked and I said well I was planning on buying this game anyway.
I'll frigging pay for it.
I got to finish the second level, which I successfully did, but anyway, I I'm not.
I guess I'm not going to bother.
Click the clack and look it up.
34:22
I think my run took maybe 7 hours.
God.
So it's very time consuming.
I I am a.
Masochist and I was playing this game primarily on the couch with a steam deck.
And hey, so I will give the developers credit.
This game acts like you can play this on the steam deck and like pray for those poor souls playing the switch in handheld mode.
34:46
I mean good Lord like but it took me what was it 12?
I think 12 hours was my save file log for the first town to fail on the on the first boss fight.
On like the last, on like the last of the Harpies, it took me 12 hours to fail the first town.
35:06
So I think like for me, I think that was like just me not playing it on the right interface.
Like it was noticeably much much faster on the desktop with yours clicking.
But I will you know like all credit to the devs like you like can scroll around with the control stick when they work you can like you know.
35:25
Go through your different character.
Sheets and all like the crazy number of like.
Menus and sub menus and gold and stone buying and StarCraft style menus of town building.
35:53
I would love to play this game on a on a plane.
Like you you can manipulate your overlords to a fine degree on the steam deck.
I don't know that I'd recommend playing this game on the Steam deck unless you have like I think what were you saying like in the in the discord, like a transcontinental flight?
Like it would it would work great for that would that would be.
I feel like would be a great way to.
Spend the time.
The more time I'm I'm I'm like cursing about my heroes getting killed, the less time I have to think about how I'm going to get deep vein thrombosis.
And I'm tall for for plane flight, for plane travel anyway, yeah, but so for me, the spell that's that this game casts on me.
36:19
The trick that it pulls, which I'm very impressed by, is that this game takes a long time to play.
But even when I'm losing.
When I get to that final fight and I've spent six hours on the run and I die, still had fun the whole time, I'm going to join it all the way through very rarely.
36:37
Did I say, yo, I'm not, I'm not feeling it.
I'm not digging it.
I've been really, yes, very much enjoying this game, Even when.
Even when I lose.
That's that's.
That's incredible for me.
Like it.
It definitely like I would do a night or two nights.
36:53
I'd be like okay, I got.
I got to turn this off for a second because I need a break.
And every time I loaded it up again, I felt like I was greeted with that screen of like, you just finished the round with the Knights and now I've got 10 different icons on the left asking me to make about 1000 decisions.
And it's just like right in a row, like okay, I got to choose all of the the, the, the gods of of the purple and gold.
37:16
I have to make all those decisions.
I've got to make decisions about my characters.
What am I going to level up?
What abilities am I going to buy?
What?
How am I going to change to town?
Just like.
Oh no.
This is this is where this is.
The biggest thing this game I think gets wrong is it has no attention to decision fatigue the way you structure A.
37:34
Game is you do some number of decisions and then feedback.
Feedback is like the heart blood of these kind of games where it's like you do some heartbeat that it's a big.
It's a shopping cart full of blood.
I I heard heart blood.
But anyway, I probably should.
37:50
Spit out this gum, right?
Yeah.
But, right.
Yeah, you know that's a very you're making an excellent point.
I hadn't, I hadn't considered that.
Right.
That's what it is like the decisions though.
Back and forth, back and forth.
Sure.
Well, I think that's made-up for by some extent, to some extent by how much feedback there is everywhere else, like nice satisfying sound effects, nice satisfying animations.
38:14
And yeah, the I feel like any action I take in this game, I'm getting that.
Ooh, I'm getting that response.
I'm getting that feedback.
I'm seeing it on screen and I'm.
I'm feeling it.
That's like that's during the night.
I agree for the night, the daytime though, all those decisions in a row where you're selecting like, oh I'm going to level this up, like what are you feeling when you like level something up or when you buy something It's like Oh well that might come and you handy later, but like it's just it's in your the 1st. 20 hours I was dreading the the town portions and for after that.
38:49
I I dread it less.
So, and I do genuinely enjoy the the base building, the daytime segments.
I feel like this game.
What about that?
Wait, wait, I want you say you enjoyed the base building.
Like, what about that was enjoyable?
Well.
After I sort of got a handle on the mechanics and did a little bit of light reading about about like various you know tactics and and strategies.
39:13
Well, after I read the game FA Q's with the wonderful, you know, ASCII artwork, I.
I had a better understanding of the game and I was like excited to level up my characters and like, oh, I'm going for this particular type of build with this guy, this person, this gal, this individual.
I'm gonna go for after this particular type of equipment.
39:31
It may sound silly, but just like hitting hitting the mine more gold button and hearing the Ching and the little digging thing like Oh yeah, like that that that hits like that.
I enjoy that the story segments, the little story and dialogue segments with the Goddesses.
39:48
I found pretty intriguing like ooh I'm gonna get to find out a little bit more about these and slowly there's more information revealed.
And they did a great job of making these two godly forces feel otherworldly and elders.
Cuz when they first appear, they're just a shadow, like they're just this.
40:07
You know, this this vague outline and it's like, oh, interesting.
But then after a huge investment of time, admittedly, oh, you get to see this full-fledged big Sprite of of each character and it feels like, oh, I felt like it did a great job of communicating that that unknowable sort of concept of like meeting with this entity that's on a totally different level.
40:29
So yeah, those sorts of things, which, I don't know, maybe it's very possible that I'm just being hoodwinked by like good sound design and, you know, graphic work and, you know, my brain is being lit up by just the the, the stuff that's going on on screen and that there's not as much, I don't know.
40:50
Meat to it.
Maybe there's not as much meat as I think there is, but I definitely agree with to some extent with your your point about that feedback.
You make a lot of decisions.
You make a ton of decisions and then there's not any immediate or even like shortly thereafter payoff.
41:09
Sometimes I feel like this game is like.
Throwing you into Warcraft 3 multiplayer like right out of the right out of the gate instead of like interest like slowly introducing like the tutorial mode is good but like like start me off with just like 2 two sides instead of three and like then like your next haven is like maybe three sides and I don't know if like the like later havens.
41:34
Have like 4 or multiple like angles of attack but like like on my first 12 hour playthrough sounds like a long time.
But I think like if you were playing this on a PC you'd probably crack it in half that but it just it felt like there was a lot of symbology.
41:53
There were a lot of like these intricately hide in systems to each other that like requires like a lot of mental energy to keep track of.
But even after I I failed the first town.
I'm like okay.
Let's see how like this restart experiences hit the restart button.
42:09
Okay.
It's the same town.
All the pits are in the same spot.
So like no no proc Gen. there.
But now I knew what all the systems were.
I'm like okay before I didn't have any idea what what gold was and why that was useful.
And now I know like what stone is and why that's useful and I've like accumulated all these meta progression unlocks Thank you purple and gold goddesses along the way.
42:29
We're now.
I'm.
I'm like, okay.
Stone walls everywhere you.
You ain't getting through this time, and I'm going to put some of my barrackses in such a way as to like Terrance supply depot block off like the walls around to like, OK, these are acting as me.
42:48
Yeah, exactly.
And and all the abilities on the heroes were totally different on the 2nd playthrough.
Like, oh, I haven't seen this one before.
What does this one do?
Big electricity bolt explosion of ASCII art goodness?
OK, that was pretty satisfying.
So I think there's like those hooks to keep me there.
43:05
But I think, Colin, you were cracking your knuckles when Andrew was mentioning the gold and and purple goddesses.
Oh yeah.
I was going to say.
I thinking about it.
And I think the IT truly is perfect to say I couldn't care less about them, because if I hated them, I would care more.
43:25
But I feel nothing about them.
I clicked through it.
My biggest.
My biggest thought about them is annoyance that I couldn't click through the dialogue faster or there was no way to turn off the listen to their dialogue at all setting.
I was supremely like.
43:42
After the absolutely amazing interest cinematic.
I completely checked out of the story and I was like, I just not doing it for me.
I don't, I don't really care.
You're kind of spoon fading it to me and it's like.
43:59
And once I kind of, like, hit that, well, I've decided I don't want to care or I don't care about it.
I'm just like, you kind of are saying the same thing as like, welcome to the Oracula Commander.
I'm like, faster, click faster.
I don't.
I've already seen this blurb go faster through this.
They repeat.
44:16
It too, don't they?
They do and.
You can't click it.
It makes it like the text scroll out slightly before you can click it and it wastes you know. 3/4 of a second of my time, which is apparently.
It's an impossible amount of time for me to waste when I've been spending 10 hours on a run.
44:34
It feels a little, but I don't know the the dialogue choices when you are given them, which are kind of are they super inspired, not really choices.
I guess you get to pick which, yeah, that's a good point.
They're not really choices.
44:49
I feel like that could have been if they were choice, it'd be different, I felt.
Like it was just like, Oh well.
I get to pick one of the right and later, Eventually you'll get to it.
Yeah, exactly.
I wish that was beefed up a little bit.
Yeah, certainly.
I just really.
45:05
Care about it though, like it's like, this isn't why I'm playing the game.
I really like the game.
I feel like, yeah, I feel like if you don't care about it, it's easy enough to ignore it without consequence and get through it in a relatively timely fashion.
But sure, I guess it could be sped up even more.
45:23
No, I mean.
That's what I'm saying.
Like, I couldn't care less.
It was just like, yeah, just click through, click through, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, okay.
Next thing it could have just been.
Another You weren't even inventory.
Your info wasn't, or your interest wasn't even piqued.
When slowly the goddesses began to change, that wasn't engaging.
45:44
Or when they when they.
When they?
Stood up.
With Cloudy Visage and they were like, weirdly partly nude, pixelated art.
And with tastefully covered clouds across their nipples, it was like.
I think that reveal was spectacular.
46:01
Like, whoa, Oh my gosh, I'm God for the first time.
Whoa.
My mind, my poor puny, mortal mind, is being blown.
I'll admit I did.
Read the dialogue a couple times after they've revealed themselves.
And then I was like, Nope, I'm still not still still over it.
OK, well, I mean, I don't think it's.
I certainly don't think it's.
46:17
But I'm gonna dial.
This little.
I don't think it's the best part of the game.
That's I'm glad.
I'm glad.
That you got any or that you you got something out of it because.
They definitely put work into it.
Sure, sure.
I think part of the reason that I am pretty engaged during those segments is that I love it when an RTS game or a tactics game makes you the player.
46:39
A character like StarCraft One does that, XCOM does that.
XCOM, I think you're called the commander, even, and that's something that StarCraft 2 did not do, which was big, big.
You don't have any but you.
Don't have any decisions to make.
46:56
I don't think that I don't know if that matters.
I just like being part of the story.
I'm just happy to be here.
Just like this podcast I just showed up, I'm not sure.
But with regards to the attractiveness of the of the goddesses, does anyone else think that the the portraits of all the randomly generated heroes are like, on average, very attractive?
47:20
You know, I was trying.
There's a very.
I'm getting some weird looks.
I felt like I was playing a dating stem.
Like, yeah, I'd love to take Ashley the Fearless out for a coffee or something.
I mean, of course they were after.
She bangs in the skull of the mutant Lord I finely tuned them to be.
47:38
My harem of attractive fighter women?
Perfectly diamond.
Symmetrical faces.
There's a there's a YouTube series that that I think people that they're still doing called Monster Factory where these people like these people, the Mcelroys.
47:56
Well, you know, I only follow them whenever a new video comes out.
But like, of course.
But yeah, they'll they'll like try to contort the Dark Souls character creation or like Mass Effect thing into like these.
Hideous.
Like goons and I was like okay, how can I monster factory this game with the character portraits, it was just like hitting the random button over and over and over.
48:15
And I'm like none of these people have like like giant foreheads or like you know, like very, very kenshy eyes, body, body shapes, just horrible mutants.
Yeah, they all look like generally, generally pleasing Hollywood actors with like different goofy looking medieval haircuts and and skin tones.
48:37
I did appreciate that there was like like a character code that you can copy and paste so you could be like, oh like I like.
I feel like this is a game that you could probably accidentally spend like 5 hours just customizing what your characters look like only to have them die from some like bullshit zombie attack.
48:54
But if you copied and pasted that character code, you can send it to all of your friends.
Be like, ah yes, Odom Stouthammer can live on in Colin and Will and Andrew's game.
Even though that or you could just remake them.
Again, in the next yeah, that's also true.
Yeah, that that is fun.
49:11
There is there's some also some opportunity for some like head cannoning where it's like, oh, I'm gonna take my my, my hero, my OC and like put them in every town and and play through.
I don't know if that's necessarily what they had in mind.
But yeah, that's kind of a fun option.
I I thought like the the hero generation and like the level of depth in the hero, the randomization was like pretty good and the the traits that are randomly assigned, it's not like super deep or like super mechanically involved, but like it's like give each character, each hero a little bit, a little bit of info like I had a or a little bit of a well character.
49:51
I thought the traits were pretty good.
I mean, they weren't like.
Too crazy or the?
Perks.
The between the traits and the perks, like it did a good job of like you customize your character over the course of the levels and whatnot.
The part of it that I I liked less was the loot swap decision mechanics.
50:16
It was like, OK, I've got six different characters and 15 different pieces of equipment, let's try and figure out what the optimal build is.
It's like I don't.
Want this?
I don't want to do this.
But I can't.
50:31
Not because my brain won't let me not optimize.
I can't not.
Helen, do you think?
The the Kickstarter success for the Last Spell Board Game is going to be more simplified or is it going to be more of these like crazy brass Birmingham style board game tracks upon tracks upon tracks?
50:56
I don't know.
Scott, I'll have to talk to you about this offline, but I did play Where is it?
Twilight Inscription, which is Twilight Epiriam, the role in right board game over the weekend.
And it was too much.
51:12
It was not streamlined enough from Twilight Imperium.
Would you say that was?
More or less cognitive load than this game.
Since I was the one who was.
Teaching it to people significantly more because I had to answer all of the questions from all of the people.
51:29
But no, I I felt like this game I was talking with will about this on Sunday, where if I would restart this game, I would choose not to unlock some of the weapons so that it would be forced to give me only a subset of these weapons.
Because it was like I am overwhelmed with choice and I don't.
51:46
I just want like you to tell me which one I I need like the Diablo style like.
Just give me a number of which one's the best.
I eventually just started picking whichever 1 cost the most and be like I'm just gonna assume that this is probably the best one.
But they also wouldn't show you if you hovered over it and it was like pull like you compare and contrast This new weapon versus build weapon didn't auto show you all of the stats of the character.
52:10
So I'd be like constantly switching back and forth be like which does this person have?
100% reliability, or 0 percent?
Is this person the one that's got plus a billion to poison damage, or is that the other one who's the druid that's got the staff but she's the one who does shadow damage or whatever?
52:32
I didn't find that part.
To be interesting, but I'm pretty sure that like you make your characters much much much better if you if you do the work to optimize them.
So I I couldn't.
I couldn't help myself so this is interesting cuz this generally is not my type of game like my top like favorite games of all time are just like shooters.
52:57
Just like straight up third person first person shooters generally.
Wait, can you game just A?
Few just so I have a little bit more confidence.
Life, Max Payne, Duke Nukem, I don't know, the STALKER series is probably in there somewhere.
And yeah, I play.
53:17
I'm a big fan of the original Fallout games and there was this period of time where I bought three or four of these turn based tactical games and thinking, yeah, I do like, I like these games, I like Fallout and I would play them.
53:38
I just get so bored, so quick, too slow, was not interested, couldn't be bothered to learn the systems, couldn't be bothered to fine tune my characters.
But this game I feel like is has that a certain level of depth, but it's very accessible for me.
53:56
Personally, and the fact that I'm willing to not over optimize maybe is a positive for me.
Enjoying the game leads to me enjoying it more because I don't get caught up in that analysis paralysis as much like I want to try to make something that is.
Semi meta, but I'm not hyper focused on making it perfect and I'm I'm focused just enough for it to be engaging I guess.
54:21
Maybe.
I don't know.
So I I feel like I.
Liked.
I mean we had the the two different the day and the night phase.
Like I very much enjoyed the night phase.
I enjoyed the like little tactical combat.
I wish that it had been a little bit more focused like they had.
54:37
You could eventually they're coming from all four different direct north-south, east, West of your town.
I felt like that spread your attention a lot and I wanted to be able to like have all my people kind of nearer to each other and with more synergy.
But I really did enjoy the little puzzle of the game.
54:56
A lot.
Like, was it the best?
Maybe not, but it definitely grabbed my attention and I I was like.
Sitting at work being like.
Man, I just won't be home playing this game.
I'm jonesing.
I'm jonesing to play Last Spell right now and I haven't had like a true like craving to play a game in a while.
55:17
So can I can?
I give.
I want to give you my.
Evaluation of the night time here because it seems like it might be a little bit different because I really a lot of things to to chess and like kind of like the and thinking about like how many branching like options are there what how you focus your efforts here.
55:33
And so in this game in particular I've been kind of looking at it through that lens of OK you just started at night time there's dudes coming in from all four sides.
Well, that to me felt like you just started the game of chess, but you don't know at all which pond to move first.
55:49
And so instead of like being like, Oh yeah, well, I'm going to move E4.
I mean, like, you know, just going to start out with like, here are some openings that are good.
I know this is my general, like this, this.
And this game is like, well, maybe I'll move H4 or maybe.
And you just kind of like you don't really know what's best.
56:05
And in fact, I'm not sure that there is really a best.
It's like you just kind of want to maximize damage.
And so you just end up sitting there with like, OK, well, all the moves are pretty much the same.
I'm going to like do a lot of.
A OE.
And then I'm going to try and like get as much damage done as I can and I'm going to retreat and be on the edge of where they can reach.
56:25
And maybe there's like a little bit of synergy where like, hey, he goes in really deep and this other guy like gives him an extra move so that he can get back out.
But like, to me like that was just like it was just like that over and over and over again.
Like okay, I got that three by two grid that the Archer can hit.
56:40
Where is the three by two grid he's going to hit?
And if not that, then like it's just the sort of decisions that were being made.
It didn't feel.
It felt maybe it felt more like checkers, but like checkers without like, interesting hopping and like other dynamics.
It just felt like checkers.
Yeah, yeah, it.
56:56
Just it.
Didn't capture me very well with.
I don't.
I know you.
Just need to compare it to a different game than.
Chess or Checkers?
Or what's the?
What's the?
Star Wars game that they play with the monsters on the the checkerboard thing and the the guy likes.
I'm sure there's a name, but it might have been turned into Legends.
57:14
Who knows if it's Canon anymore.
What the name is, I don't.
I don't know if you're fairly characterizing the depth of this game like you are managing, like the decisions of I want to maximize my damage are important, but you're also having to.
57:33
Track that was a big breakthrough for me.
I didn't realize that like the monsters movement is reduced.
That didn't occur to me like my first couple of runs like as they get damaged.
So like managing the amount of damage you're doing, managing your your heroes positions, managing the monsters positions and keeping track of each monster and seeing how far they can move.
57:53
You know, tracking your defenses, hit points, monitoring the different sides of the battle I think is a very important part to this game design that you have like different battlefronts happening at different times.
Is is is very important and engaging and then also just sort of generally having to manage threats on the battlefield.
58:16
Like should I prioritize just outputting raw damage and kit and doing as much raw number of hit points as damage as possible or do I need to focus on like these specific types of like boss monsters and and specific types.
I think it's, I think there's a little bit more going on under the hood than you are giving a credit for Will and I don't know if.
58:37
There is our infinite levels, but I think it's it's it's it's enough to not be overwhelming but still be engaging well and like I would.
If you're just using the AOE Magic Missiles spam spell, you will just run out of mana.
58:59
Well, that's that's the town.
Management is all about like you just make it so that like you you all your levels you just put into mana and then your town you like buy the mana things like I never.
Ran into a man.
So I just.
Never ran into a mana, so it seems like you.
Have optimized yourself into a boring game.
59:14
I think that's that's my.
Problem is that like in the in the actual town, I'm like this kind of game always favors investments.
Like if you could just take a short like a if you can make it hard on yourself in the beginning and buy all the things that are going to produce extra like money.
That will let you like.
And so I'm just like, Oh yeah, I'm just going to do that and like and so it made it so nobody ever died.
59:34
It was there was never really a sense of challenge.
There was like, and so it breached the first town.
I'm like, man, that was just arduous, sort of like maybe there's a difficulty thing or something or maybe it gets harder later on.
But like it just it just felt.
Like a chore to something.
Once you beat the 1st town, the first proper town you're giving when you choose a level, you pick the Apocalypse level, and so there's like normal difficulty in Apocalypse level, like one or two or whatever it's called is like 20% more damage or something like that.
1:00:03
So I mean, there is like a a that's not me there.
Handicapped, yeah.
To address what your early early point of like not knowing.
Like they're not being like a good chess openers, not knowing what the right move is opening move is.
I think part of that is the game does tell you like how big of an attack is going to come from the four sides, like with the map and then later in the game and this you know.
1:00:30
This doesn't totally address your fair criticism, but you do eventually unlock a building called the Seer, which.
I have not actually going back to how I play these sorts of games I was talking about earlier, I have not bothered building this building because the building, so I don't know exactly what it does.
1:00:51
But the description is that it gives you insight into the next attack.
And that would help inform.
The tactics that you might take and that might appeal to you will, but the reason I haven't built that building is because I feel like, Nope, that's gonna drive me to madness if I know more information.
1:01:08
Also, it's gonna drive me to making poor decisions.
Sorry.
So I'll just say.
You should build it not because of that I had that information, never used it, but it also lets you push back the fog so you have like a longer time for the enemies coming in.
Like that's actually very.
1:01:25
It makes it easier that.
Kind of that kind of bugged.
Me because like in certain parts and again like you know I'm playing on like stupid newbiesy mode but like I would like clear out monsters from like the the non fog zone.
And then like, they like the the end of the night would be there and it's like, OK, well now you got to clear out all the remaining monsters.
1:01:45
That's better left.
But there's still like a big queue of monsters in the fog that even though the night is fully ended, are still going to pile in.
You're like, I got to I got to like burn like another 10 minutes here.
Like cleaning up like I've already beaten the level.
Like just like the the zombies need a surrender vote option.
1:02:02
Where?
I've clearly dominated them.
They need to give up.
I'm extending my hand over the table to shake them then call this, call this game off and they're just like, no me spawn more enemies and I'm just like, OK, yeah, I like, I can waste waste more turns like running my get my little dude like across the map to go and kill this one other zombie.
1:02:25
Oh yeah, sure.
That that like.
There were definitely a couple of times where I'm like, oh.
I need to get this one person from this side of the map to the other.
It's like, well, that's gonna be a while.
Sure, Yeah, it'd be nice if there.
Was like a little auto battler, like finish the fight that you've obviously won.
1:02:44
Yeah, I'm learning that maybe I'm kind of bad at this game, cuz you know, sounds like you're just the Walker Park you've beaten the.
First count boss.
I haven't gotten like.
That was another thing that really bugs you.
Beat the second town, Bob.
Andrew, you you.
Are perhaps the best of us because you beat the.
1:03:01
I mean, Will, I'm gonna be in the second town.
I think maybe it just.
Means I might be the most enthusiastic about this game and then I think we just dumped the most time into it.
But you beat it.
You beat it in less time than I did.
Good to know.
Interesting.
Good to.
Yeah, I wish I.
1:03:19
Wish that it was interesting.
I I feel like if if we have to make an analogy to chess, I would say that you do it's most like you were playing chess on four separate boards because that's what I felt like it ended up being.
1:03:35
A lot of times for me is that I would like split my hero.
I would be like, well, this one's a three star attack on this side, so I'll put two heroes there and this one's only a one star, so I'll put one here and each of them were like barely related to each other.
You're like.
And I wanted more synergy between my people, but I couldn't afford it because you need what?
1:03:54
Well, you just look them up so much and you can make synergies.
Between two people you make synergies.
Between two people, you.
Can make synergies between 1:00.
Person and defenses even like there are there are synergies to be had and defenses but yeah I.
Think I wanted it to be so.
When I earlier said that it's tower defense, but you're the tower.
1:04:12
I wanted it to be more tower defense than it end up being like.
I wanted you to be able to like.
Channel the enemy slightly more.
And I wanted it to be.
I felt like the wave came from all direction.
I wanted to be a little more focused so that you could like plan out like, oh, all my six people.
1:04:32
Like this person goes here, then this person goes here, and then this is this, which is this stat and then this blah, blah, blah and then this blah, blah.
And you can like get a little bit of that with two or three people, but I wanted it to be.
More you remember.
Those StarCraft you used map settings match where like I can see it was tower defense, but you like you built the path with like supply depots and like missile turrets and stuff and like sunken D.
1:04:57
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, that.
I feel like.
Don't Google that.
So sunken defense.
Because if you got your sunken colonies and you gotta defend the place anyway, yeah.
So yeah, like I fired up Bloons Tower Defense 6 cuz I'm like okay, I know Will is like hot.
1:05:15
This game like crazy and I know it's like a similar kind of tower defense idea but it just it it felt more yeah, like I think the last spell has its own thing going for it and I think that's okay.
I just feel like it it just got to the point a little quicker.
1:05:30
It feels like it's it's kind of.
Stretching out a little too long.
And if there was a way, then like I thought like, well, maybe is this going on too long?
And then I'm like, oh wait, no, but my production phases, I need to get all I need to get my macro all up in a line.
So that way for the final boss fight I can have all these things.
1:05:47
I'm like, there's not enough time.
But then yeah, so I don't know if I was.
I just need to play this on the desktop more and avoid playing this on the Steam deck at all costs.
Yeah, yeah, Which we we.
Keep talking about the the length of time this game takes to play.
So I I am a Warhammer 40,000 player or hobbyist, I should say.
1:06:05
Realistically, I think I've played less than like 20 matches because it takes a long time to play Warhammer 40,000.
It takes about as many hours as it takes to play through a run of one of these.
Of last, the last spell.
1:06:21
Half of that is just painting the minis, that's true.
Yeah, well, more of it in some cases like, I don't know, the average match, I don't know, it's like maybe 4 showers.
So.
And oftentimes when I'm playing that, playing Warhammer tabletop or I'm playing a board game, So oftentimes I'm like, gosh, I feel like this would be streamlined and way better and way faster if it was a video game.
1:06:40
And I feel like the last spell.
I really enjoy what I really like about the last spells.
It feels like, oh cool, I can have this epic grand battle defense of this town with a ton of stuff going on, a ton of monsters on the board, but like it's snappy, it's fast and I think compared to and so like for that experience it's fast, but also it's fast in my estimation compared to the average tactical combat game or like RPG with grid based turn based combat.
1:07:06
Like, I appreciate that it doesn't.
It takes a long time to play.
I feel like on the whole, the game respects my time.
I bet you we.
Played the same amount of the tactical part and I've just spent like three more hours in the city part they could, if you could get that part to be a little snappier, I'd be a little a little quicker.
1:07:24
Hey, come on.
Yeah.
Well, hey, so hey, what a what a grand discussion we're having about gameplay and everything.
But if I'm remembering correctly, this is a Rogue like podcast.
And this is where I have something kind of negative to say about this game.
I don't know if it's really much of A rogue, like it feels more like a a a tactical combat.
1:07:48
Turn based combat.
Tower defense game with really long spaced out save points.
Like it's yeah, what do we, what do we think about that?
And in fact I would further say that I don't know if it has many rogue like elements to begin with slash.
1:08:05
I feel like the game would maybe through DLC or something, which I believe they're working on, could benefit for more Rd., like randomization and emergent game play elements, yes?
Absolutely.
I think that.
When Will was talking about how or Will or Scott said, restarted the next town, it was the same town.
1:08:23
It's like.
It should be a different.
Town it should have, I mean, not that different.
But the wall should be in different spots.
There should be like a random sunken boat here now where there wasn't one before.
A real big tree.
Now it's got to be meaningful.
1:08:40
I mean like it binding it like it just like just because we just mentioned it like Binding of Isaac, you start with like a different like core item.
And the other thing you find right away is like there has to be like a substantial meaningful difference.
I think when you start like maybe not like right away, but like very quickly starting to build synergies towards something, it's 100.
1:08:59
Percent on our To Do List in the future, but in Into the Breach shares a lot of similar designs here.
Grid based, turn based, lots of tactical elements, but it's much more bite size.
A lot of the levels in that game are all similarly not precedually generated, but they are like the randomness part is like, how are those bespoke chunks like Binding of Isaac like?
1:09:26
Pre prebuilt rooms, how are those glommed on to each other?
And yeah, I feel like also for listeners, stay tuned when we get to our 2 1/2 hour grog pod page match of like our definitions of what a rogue like is for.
1:09:46
Stay tuned for that.
But if we if we go by like gridbased, turnbased, PERMA death Rpg's as like.
Various factors involved.
It ticks all those boxes.
The one that it just doesn't have is procedural generation of map terrain, which I think is like it's an important one, but I don't know that that's like the be all end all of it being in the genre or not.
1:10:12
I do agree that this is like.
Like a brotado.
Very much is that kind of theme in a very different package.
This game I feel like less so, but I think that's okay because it helps to evolve the genre in a weird way that the more weirdness the better, I think.
1:10:40
I forgot, this is a Rogue like podcast.
I thought we just reviewed games.
Yeah, thanks for the reminder there.
Rogue Just.
Rogue elements.
I don't feel like this was a very rogue like game at all and I feel like we probably shouldn't play Into the Breach for this podcast.
The game, I just think it's fundamentally not a rogue like game In the same way we're like, we probably shouldn't play XCOM, not a rogue.
1:10:55
I don't.
I think that's just fundamentally I I.
Actually, I feel like if you.
Well, yeah.
We've already played, just slowly.
1:11:13
I feel like XCOM on Ironman mode is arguably a rogue.
There is an Ironman.
We've already played these games.
All of us have played Minecraft.
Yeah, we gotta do new games, I think.
Or like mostly new games just play Minecraft.
Only yes.
Just latest buyer Okay.
Fine.
Yes.
Yeah, what, more games?
Do you need?
Right.
Let's move into rankings.
1:11:29
How about Yeah, yeah.
So for each podcast, we try to rank these games against our.
Horde that we've collected thus far.
I guess maybe I'll kick off to start.
So we, our listeners forced us to to review at gunpoint.
1:11:46
Rotado in the last spell.
Brotado.
I think it's it's just fun to say this is very much an all devs go to heaven moment where solo dev the game is $5.
Perfectly fun to play like in a borderline vegetative state on the couch when you have like trashy reality TV going.
1:12:07
It is a slam dunk for that.
I don't know that it really needs to push the envelope much further than that.
It would be nice if it did, but I don't know that that's a requisite for the game to be fun how it is.
It is very much a like watch YouTube streamers play it and watch them freak out about it much more than I think playing it for myself.
1:12:27
I don't get that by that's just so weird when you told me that is YouTube streamers doing this I it is it.
Is all over like the YouTube world, like streaming community where the like I think part of it is that like the little the little rotato characters have like like the reactionary like like faces going by default.
1:12:44
So any YouTube thumbnail incorporating them has that kind of like, wow.
That's how you optimize a game these days.
Yeah, Incredible.
It's like, I think there's a lot to react to, right?
Like, if you're a streamer, it's like, oh, I just got a new item.
Let me, you know, rap about that for a bit and then, oh, I got there's a new one.
1:13:02
Sure.
It's very much a.
That the aesthetic.
Does do pretty well.
It's like customizing your counter.
Anyway, so so for me, Potato's gonna go just behind Shattered Pixel Dungeon and just in front of Hand of Fate.
I think this is like the like.
The line of like, yeah, this is pretty good.
1:13:18
Like, I think you would have fun if you had never played these games before.
I think I just have like a pretty stacked upfront list up at the top and I think that's where the last spell is going to go.
I think like for.
Me like it it.
Feels a little grindy a lot of the time, but I have to put it ahead of Darkest Dungeon 2 because of the maximum acceptable jank factor, and I'm going to put it just behind Hand of Fate Two, so I'm going to split the sequels there.
1:13:45
As my new number 9 game on my list, yeah, I think like the like, I was working out to the soundtrack earlier today and it is just phenomenal.
The soundtrack, that art design, I think, like, there's a lot of complicated elements going on and I think it takes a lot of skill to make sure that those don't completely bamboozle the player.
1:14:07
And I think that like I've I've crossed that threshold.
Like, OK, these systems make sense.
I don't know how much more I'm going to play a bit.
But they do have some Dlc's in the hopper that I'd be curious to check out in the future.
So for me, Potato landing in at #20 and last spell at #9 on my list.
1:14:25
How do we pick?
I don't know.
Usually we give you started speaking.
So you.
Yeah.
Usually we give each other a look or something, but now it's just like I got to look two directions 3.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.
I can't just be like quivers, whatever that that one is.
That I'm pointing to the Zoom.
Yeah, we're all in different like Windows.
1:14:41
I see Will you're pointing at will.
So we'll go.
There's now 4 battlefronts to right.
Yeah, so I'm not so nice.
I don't think that all devs go to heaven.
And so yeah, I'm I'm going to be brutally honest here, as I as I always am with this stuff.
1:14:59
Rotato.
Yeah, if if only we knew what was happening.
Potatoville on the potato land.
I might have been able to give this a better ranking, but on my 1:00 to 10:00 scale this is getting the 4.5 which I have a six is like my minimum for recommend.
1:15:16
So it's it's going to be my not recommend zone.
And I think if you're interested in doing a vampire survivors like game first of all you should play that one if you haven't already.
And then I think that like, I mean I'm liking the halls of Torment.
I got 20 hours in this game so far and I'm still like having a good time, so like play some like better ones 1st and then like this game is just it's just.
1:15:38
Really was not doing it for me and so yeah, that where does that put it?
That puts it.
You mentioned Shattered Pixel Dungeon.
I put this right on the level with Shattered Pixel Dungeon and and Darkest Dungeon two at 44.5.
So yeah, not not not such a great one.
In my book, the last spell better.
1:15:57
It makes it up to the minimum of recommends, which is to say 6 out of 10.
Yeah, I think I I send it up best.
I think it's just way too much decision fatigue, just like making 1000 decisions in a row.
I think there's a lot of better sort of tactical base games out there.
1:16:15
I did like the I love the narrative of this and I I think it had an interesting idea.
But I think to Collins point if they just reduce the complexity of like the number of sides made it more of a tower defense and maybe less of an RPG or just take just pulled some things out like those the the goddesses the meta progress like just make it a little bit more simple in some ways but then like focus on what you're doing.
1:16:38
Well I think that that would have been a great way of approaching it.
So 6:00 on that one.
So in terms of actual rankings for me.
So we played like let's say we have 30 games here where's my will, will rank.
So the last spell is my fourteenth out of 30 and Rotato comes in at 19.
1:16:57
Yeah.
So that's that's it for me.
I don't know who you should go next.
And.
We'll have our new intern be the hammer for the episode.
Yeah, Rotato, I feel like I.
I have not played enough of.
It to truly feel confident in my ranking, so I'll give that a pretty wide plus or minus for for my rankings.
1:17:19
I have it ranked at 16 out of the 30I enjoyed the hour that I played of it.
I do not care at all for the theme.
I would be perfectly fine if it was.
Zero or the the.
1:17:36
The aesthetics just.
Just raw numbers on screen.
Yeah, it would be.
It would be indifferent to me or it would be interesting which would be.
But like I had like some satisfying running around shooting whatever couch potato mode game I think it would be.
1:17:51
If it's a pretty fun game, I could see myself like popping this open when I'm just like, I don't feel like learning a game right now and I have nothing else to play.
Like I would not pop open last spell because I'm.
I'm just bored and I'm just like, I don't, I don't want to.
1:18:08
Yeah, I'll play some, I'll play some last spell like, no, that's not going to happen.
But overall I think it was like it has met my criteria for I I would recommend someone go play it.
Also if great value the the game per dollar is, it gives it a little bit of a boost.
1:18:29
Last spell is my #4 game now.
I liked it a lot.
I I think there was at least some bias in there of like I I was so close to being an amazingly good game in my opinion.
1:18:49
There was a lot of things that ground it down the the grind of the game slowed it down a lot for me and I felt like it was a little bit disconnected.
In terms of the like, the nighttime gameplay and the daytime gameplay, I feel like there's just not as interesting to me.
1:19:09
But boy, I I was Jones in to play it and I felt like a true like I put in 30 hours and I don't put that many hours in it, like we only have two weeks to play these games.
I normally don't like find the time in my schedule to fit.
1:19:27
Almost a full week of work in the next in the two weeks between when we do these podcasts.
So I feel like that has to say something for the game.
Like I I wanted to play it.
The music is exquisite.
I think it might be the best soundtrack of the games that we've played.
1:19:44
At least the intro song was like really good.
I I liked the pixel aesthetics.
I thought it did a pretty good job.
I think it was.
It was.
Very close to being like I I now having been inspired by will I put it at an 8 out of 10 because I finally like fine if we're now that we're adding Andrew too I feel like we might have to put like numerical out of 10 ranking so we can like for a while while we like recalibrate our scale but eight out of 10 like pretty solid game.
1:20:20
Would recommend people go try it out.
Andrew, bring us home.
All right.
So potato, unfortunately goes to the the bottom of my rank.
It's in last place, but I I played it and I was enjoying it and I think it's pretty satisfying to play.
1:20:39
And while I don't quite understand the aesthetic, it is like, you know, quirky and fun and whimsical.
And I I think I get why it's so popular.
I mostly understand why it's so popular.
I have some sense.
Yeah, I mean I guess I just keep down grading it.
1:20:58
And then the last spell, perhaps it could be that I've just been yearning for this deep, satisfying, tactical turn based experience for years and years and years.
Like maybe I've been yearning for it since Fallout 2 and now finally, that I've like found it in a package Where?
1:21:20
The biggest issue I usually have with these types of games is that I'm not engaged.
I get bored, but I feel like the the last, pardon me, the last spell I keep, I keep wanting to.
Wanting to.
I keep.
1:21:35
Wanting to.
Call it the final spell.
And every time I say the name, I'm like, is that the right.
No.
OK, all right.
And then I'm like, all right, I didn't say the last wish because that's a that's a Witcher story.
So anyway.
I feel like that's the game.
1:21:52
Even though it takes a very long time to play, logistically it's difficult to fit into your schedule.
It is always engaging and very satisfying, and I'm very excited to see where the DLC goes.
Even though we have like, you know, a shared library of games.
1:22:09
I went ahead and bought this game.
I was planning on buying it and.
I'm very impressed and I'm enjoying it.
And again, it's very metal so it goes with one and two.
I'm throwing up the horns.
1:22:25
That's right #2 in my stack ranking right below.
Enter the engine, which is basically perfect.
Excellent.
Well, that's gonna.
Put the last spell in our new number six overall and Bro Tato at #23 overall.
1:22:42
Anyway, moving on, if you want to e-mail into the show, we did get an e-mail that's I think we're running a little long here, but it's a good topic that I can sprinkle in for future stuff especially.
When we talk about randomness, which will come up every so often, but if you want to e-mail into the show you can write into grogpodzone@gmail.com.
1:23:05
If you want to follow us on Mastodon as the X Ship is quickly syncing, you can find us on Grogpod at gamedev dot place and our website where we have all of our rankings and.
Things to subscribe to and other dealy who's You can find that at Grogpod dot zone our next episode.
1:23:29
We pitched over to our new host Andrew to pick what inspired you to pick our episode for this upcoming week.
Well.
I gotta tell you because basically I wanted to have us play the game strafe.
1:23:48
But then I'm like, Nope, there's too much cool, good stuff to talk about in FPS design.
But we gotta say that.
So I'm like what I still want to do in FPS of some sort.
Something that is, at least from a first person perspective, we'll be playing the first person Lovecraftian horror prepared to get sanity blasted by Eldrich.
1:24:08
Yeah, this one I.
Played that one, I think.
Yeah, okay.
Well, yeah, cuz we.
We had this on the schedule ages and ages ago, before one of my numerous.
One of my numerous.
Retinkerings of the of the show format and yeah, this was, this was I think like on our slate to play before we were like, you know what, maybe we should change it up a bit.
1:24:28
But like this one actually did look very interesting at the time.
So.
So yeah, I think I'm super excited to play this, yeah.
Yeah, it's definitely got like.
It's good, a mix of aesthetics that we have not.
1:24:44
We haven't thrown in a good 90s feeling game yet really.
So I'm ready for it.
You're here.
Well, thanks for having me here and thanks for.
Letting me pick the next game.
What a deal.
I wasn't prepared, but I turned in my homework right on time.
1:25:03
Well, we're gonna, we're gonna.
Throw up the devil horns to play us out from this episode with the nice relaxing metal tunes of what?
I'm just being informed that the zombies have entered the building, they're at the door, and they're coming in.
