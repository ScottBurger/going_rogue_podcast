Hello and welcome to the Grog Pod Rogue Like Podcast summer music special.
This is a show about rogue like games of all shapes and sizes, and this week we're focusing in on the off overlook background music of this genre.
We have a wide diversity of stuff to listen to today, from the biggest budget games to the smallest solo dev projects.
1:02
But first, let's continue to listen in on our opening track.
The the.
2:27
Wow, what a way to start our summer rogue like music fest.
You're listening to Tides of the Fascari composed by Danielle Zandara with solo violin performance by Camila d'onofrio, performed by the Budapest Scoring Symphony Orchestra, all for the, you guessed it, $5 indie game Vampire Survivors.
2:54
I am your conductor of this episode, Scott Burger and joining me in the orchestra chamber pit are my Co hosts.
Hey, it's Andrew Harshman, and boy, I just am a music lover, and I think that my few years of taking piano as a kid, it really gonna serve me well discussing music in a way that is very scientific and specific.
3:20
And of course also we have.
Colin, I'm a sad trumpet noise used for comedic effect.
Oh, but we're missing someone.
Yes, we this was the the optional attendance episode for my Co host where we're I was the intent was to give give the Co hosts, you know, a a summer break episode, let them sit at the beach, get a good tan going.
3:42
That's where I'm assuming our our good buddy Will is at the moment missing out on all the good tunes.
But yeah, normally for these for these episodes, this is where we pick a rogue light or rogue light game and talk about it and then rank it for selection in the Omega Bowl at the end of the season.
4:02
But for our summer break special episode, we're focusing in on the music of rogue light games.
What better way to do it in an audio podcast format?
We've talked a lot about indie games here, but we haven't really had an opportunity to do a music showcase.
So what we'll be doing here is well, I guess also to be to be clear, like we, we can't play all of these songs in total because then it like this podcast will take like 5 hours to play through or whatever.
4:29
But also.
Hopefully you.
Hear this and we're not stricken from the record for copyright infringement.
Don't worry, we'll we'll find all sorts of copyright ways to get around this is fair use, right?
We're, we're providing criticism of it, et cetera, et cetera.
So yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll be playing just a, a, a little, a little teaser clip and be talking over some of it as well.
4:53
But we'll be putting all of these up in a, in a playlist on YouTube.
If you hate the sound of our voices and just want to listen to the tunes, you have that option as well.
Check out the show notes for that.
But yeah, we have, we have all sorts of stuff to, to, to listen through.
5:10
I, I did put a, a call out to the listeners to, to submit stuff for us to pick through and we, we were just like completely overwhelmed with options.
I think.
So I feel like this, this format of a show could, could be revisited in the future as well.
5:26
So yeah, I think the listeners came through, came through quite well.
A lot of stuff we couldn't get to, a lot of terrible cuts had to be made.
But I think we have a good a good mix tape going for for tonight and we have quite the range here.
5:42
We have a big budget orchestrations like we've just heard.
We have solo compositions made by the same dev who, you know, self programmed their own game.
We have everything from metal, funk and everything in between.
So we've got quite the quite the packed agenda for today.
6:00
Some honorable mentions that didn't make the cut that we for sure check out these game soundtracks and these games as well.
All these games are great.
I, I should say, but there's soundtracks especially, but we had some listeners write in with requests for us to cover tangle deep, Roboquest, Rogue Legacy 2, Dicey dungeons, Chrono Arc, and I mean, the list just goes on.
6:24
Like there's just too many things for us to play here.
So I guess without further ado, let's let's kick off this this beach party here with something that I really think you when you think video game music, especially with this genre, you really can't go wrong with what we're about to play here to to kick us off outside of our intro segment with a little game called Crypt of the Necro Dancer.
6:52
And this is the Disco Descent stage one floor one for Crypt of the Necro Dancer.
7:11
The the the.
8:53
You're listening to Disco Descent Stage One Floor one of Crypt of the Necro Dancer by Danny Baranowski, and wow, if I couldn't think of a game more inseparable from its music, it would maybe be this one, because I have my note here.
9:11
The game is the music.
We haven't covered this game quite yet.
Stay tuned for sure.
But Colin, you probably have the most experience between Andrew and I with this game.
No, I have not played it.
OK.
But I played it a bit.
But I have watched the the Steam page interest cinematics, so I do know what the gameplay looks like.
9:32
And I guess I hadn't really like paid attention to the music quite as much as I have, just like sitting and listening, doing it.
But yeah, you can, you can almost feel how the beat influences the gameplay.
It's like very driving and especially the the intro beginning of it.
9:51
Yeah, you can.
You can feel the rhythm of the gameplay pushing the song and the song pushing the gameplay.
And I guess for clarity like this, this is a game where you are hopping from tile to tile on the beat and you have to attack on the beat and the monsters attack on the beat.
10:08
It's so much like this is a game.
One of the one of our listeners wrote in and said about video game music that always turn or they always turn the video game music off, never listen to it, which to some degree I can understand because you know, you're on the couch, you're watching the news, you're on the bus.
10:27
You don't wanna bug everybody, but this is a game like you.
You have to play with the soundtrack, if nothing else, because it's so rippin, but it is just so it is so tightly ingrained.
And I love the you're hopping around in the dungeons.
You come across the shopkeeper and the shopkeeper's also singing the song.
10:44
So great.
OK, it's.
Too good.
It's too good.
Oh, but sorry, real quick, I need to bring everyone's attention.
There's a a comment here saying that somebody who works in an emergency room thinks of this song and this beat in order to do perform CPR correctly with the correct timing.
11:03
It's like, oh wow, what a what a deal.
But yeah, this is this is definitely a rhythm based game and we will be covering it soon enough, I'm sure.
Exciting.
Yeah, without further ado, our next track we have here is from our previous episode, The Last Spell.
11:21
This one is Distant Memories.
11:35
The the None.
13:33
You're listening to Distant Memories by the French musician the algorithm Remi Gallego Gallego Gallego for the our previous episode, The Last Spell.
I love this track.
13:49
I think this track is just like it's so like dark and foreboding with it's with it's metalness, but not like overbearing.
It just has it the perfect amount of mood to it, where our our other previous episode, very metal heavy nightmare Reaper, I felt was like too, too, like like power Cordy with it's metal of just like, you know, just like pounding it all the time and there's no real letting the music kind of breathe almost this this feels like fine wine metal in a way, where it's just it's so textured and rich and really, I think helps bring out like the horror elements of this game.
14:36
I was laughing to myself because as soon as this song started playing, I I felt like I was back in the war playing the game.
And I am really started like scowling and putting my hand in my chin thinking, all right, what's, what's the next move to make?
14:54
Yeah, it's it's it's one of those, it's a great example of a a song that has metal sensibilities and metal structures without necessarily containing some, some of the, you know, actual literal instruments that are some good medals.
15:14
Yeah, definitely, definitely.
Yeah, it's outstanding.
Of course, a lot the the opening, the main title track of the last spell gets kind of talked a whole lot about and kind of steals the spotlights, but really all the music in this this game is outstanding.
15:32
Yeah, I mean, the this is one of the best soundtracks of any of the games we've played.
I, I say hands down, it is weird in that in some ways it's not the, it's, it's almost too good for the kind of gameplay.
15:50
Like I feel like I want to be like actually in there hacking and slashing when I'm listening to this.
And then I'm like, OK, no, but I actually do need to stop and scratch my beard for a lot longer than like, it makes me want to like go fast, which is not necessarily the way you want to play the game, but that is.
16:07
Kind of a funny juxtaposition, definitely.
But it it is like thinking back it, it is how it feels to remember playing the game, running around slashing dudes, exploding them with magic, etcetera.
Well, we couldn't have a a diversion about metal and rogue lakes without a game that is maybe one of the most metal rogue lakes and possibly one of like, you know, a top three of, of games that people mention in this genre.
16:40
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called Hades.
If you, if you, you know, can turn over rock and find it.
This next track is the unseen ones from Hades.
17:06
The None.
18:26
You are listening to The Unseen Ones from Hades, composed by Darren Korb, featuring Masahiro Aoki and Daisuki Kurosawa.
Aoki being noted for being the composer for Street Fighter Five, No straight roads and bayonet of three.
18:47
Can you find anything about Kurosawa?
But this is whoa, for a game that has quite a bit of shredding quite a bit of metal in it, the most shredding the most metal one.
And maybe spoiler alert for a little little later in the game, but something that's not like front and center like this is something you have to work hard to get to it.
19:09
And I feel like this is this is something that really rewards you with like a a proper ultimate super, ultra awesome final boss fight of just whoa, like, you know, I, I couldn't think of a better way to really to really shred it to end it.
19:25
Reddit to end it.
Yeah, I like it.
I was curious to listen to this song because it's been a while since I played 80s and I didn't immediately recognize of this song.
But I'm reading some comments here and yeah, I guess it's towards the end of the game.
19:44
So good on them to, you know, hold on to such a a nice little gem of music.
Now, often times when I go to a metal show and the singer needs to take a break and the musicians get to, you know, really, really show off.
20:03
Sometimes when those segments go a little long and they're noodling and noodling and noodling and widdly, widdly wah, and just sometimes it gets a little exhausting.
It's like, all right, we get it, we got it.
You're amazing.
You've mastered your craft.
You're better at this, better than I will ever be at anything else.
20:20
And but the context with which this showing off music and really like intense balls to the wall track is, is pretty appropriate since it happens towards like the very end of the game.
So I feel like it's, yeah, one of the most, you know, appropriate uses of this music, if not the most appropriate.
20:40
I do like that it incorporates all of the OR not all, but it does incorporate themes from the main tracks and like it's it's a metal version of the Hades soundtrack, but it incorporates motifs from other parts of the soundtrack so it's not entirely disconnected from the slightly less metal parts of the the rest of the soundtrack.
21:04
Oh, interesting.
See, I I didn't pick up on that.
That is nice.
Good, good stuff.
Well played.
And it, and to be clear, this is like, so this is the final boss fight of the game.
And moreover, this is the final boss fight of the game when you turn on an extra modifier to make the game substantially harder.
21:21
So there's there's an option that allows you to like.
Well, I wonder.
I didn't recognize it.
It's not good enough to have gotten to that.
I mean, I I haven't even 80 hours of of gameplay for me in Haiti's.
Like I haven't gotten gotten to that point yet and I'd listen to this.
21:37
I'm like, man, I really should go back and do that.
Cause the, the the boss fight music for that is so on point that this, this is like tantalizing me to go into that like super boss fight and like, yeah, I want to see what like if the music for the normal boss fight compared to this, like this being so much shreddier, that boss fight has just got to be so much crazier.
21:59
So I mean, I'd be excited to check that, but just from the music.
All right, well, moving on to a different kind of we're we're we're moving from metal to death metal to more death and jumping into our our next song here from doom, the rogue like unholy cathedral.
22:35
The the.
23:42
You are listening to Unholy Cathedral by Simon Volpert for the 20 plus year old game Doom the Rope Lake.
Simon being so a fun piece of trivia here.
23:58
Simon is one of the Chaos Forge community members who've who've helped develop sound and and music for this game that it's free to play, it's open source, free to play rogue like and wow.
24:14
I mean for a 20 plus year old game with a, you know, MIDI synth going on, I think this really helped.
This really just like sets the tone for for blasting demons in the in the pits of hell.
I haven't spent a whole lot of time with the with the OG Doom, but I think, you know, just listening through some of the the OG doom soundtracks, this one just nails it really just nails the tone and nails the the remix ability in a in a new and fun way, in a way that I haven't really heard of before.
24:46
Yeah, Doom has, you know, like a legendary soundtrack.
A lot of the tracks, you know, of course, famously very, very yeah.
Much inspired, if not semi copied of like existing thrash metal and metal tracks in general.
25:07
And this, this song really, I mean, lives, lives up to those expectations.
Very impressed.
First time hearing of this and I really dig the MIDI sort of stand in for guitar work and everything.
25:23
Very, very good melody and track.
And oh, switched it off like during the solo.
That's OK.
I think we might have another case like Colin was describing with Last Spell where this might almost be a little too phonetic and like driving and and like, you know, fast for a turn based game.
25:43
But I mean, you gotta have this kind of music when it comes to a Doom game.
Indeed.
Pick up one of those berserk mode power ups and woo, yeah, this is this is just plain.
Well, to continue our theme with pipe organ music, we're gonna dial up the budget a little bit here from our previous episode, Returnal.
26:05
This is Ascend the Spire.
The the.
27:54
You're listening to Ascend the Spire, composed by Joe the Waits for Returnal.
I think it's fair to say I'm I'm the only one on the podcast who got this far into the game.
I think it's fair to say the only thing that we do as Spires on this podcast is slave them, but maybe we can make an exception since this is a one off episode.
28:16
Yeah, I think you one day hear that and tell us about the context of this trend.
Yeah, like returnable is is brutally hard and I think like this was a moment in the game that like made it for me.
28:31
Like, you know, there I had, you know, wishy washy things about the story, but like you play through the 1st 3 zones of the game and there's this kind of contextual reset of like what what is going on?
There's something going on.
And the music from this particular track is kind of playing in the background throughout the fourth stage.
28:50
And you're like, what's there's, there's.
This music I gotta silence.
This music, it's driving me crazy.
And towards the end of this level, you're ascending this, this big like overgrown Spire.
And I, I think in our episode, I was comparing it to sort of the end of Ocarina of Time where you're hearing this organ music, you're getting closer and closer and it's building and building and building.
29:15
And then you have this boss fight of this, you know, mutated humanoid playing the organ and shooting orbs at you out of the organ.
And just like this, this connection between the music and like you ascending, this really epic level design was just, it was such a hit home moment in at that time for me of like, OK, we're assembling this episode of music.
29:42
This was the first track I picked where it was.
It was.
And there's a a little harmonic or there's a little four note motif going on in the background here that once you beat the game the first time, you're like, Oh my God, what?
That's where the context comes from.
29:59
And it just it completely tips the game over on itself of this, like the the context has changed completely.
And when you hear the song with that new context, you're like, Oh my God, like this is crazy.
30:14
It everything like falls into place.
It makes perfect sense where I think like right at I think we recorded that episode like 30 minutes right after I had beaten the game.
And I was like, none of this makes any sense.
What is like like the.
Yeah, I think the music in this game, particularly for the the 4th Biome and that like the kind of impact that it has is really just something that yeah, like when when I decided to put this this interesting summer episode together, I thought this is this is the one that has to go in there.
30:48
Everything else, all these other games we can cut, but this was the one that I had to had to ramble on the most at night.
And with that, we are going to jump into our our next or our next piece of music here from a traditional rogue like game.
31:07
It's quite popular called Caves of CUD.
This track is called Lazarus.
31:41
The the.
33:30
You are listening to the haunting track Lazarus by composer Gregory Hamm for the traditional rogue like caves of cud.
Wow talk about two pieces.
Just like bursting with atmosphere back-to-back.
33:46
This.
I feel like caves of cud has like the biggest ratio of like atmospheric drip to like turn base tile, like borderline Atari graphics.
This this whole soundtrack to caves have cut is amazing.
34:04
It is something that like I put it on par with like the Chernobyl miniseries soundtrack with like atmospheric.
Just you feel like you're in an alien world and in an alien environment.
Everything feels very overbearing and oppressive and different.
34:22
And there's there's just something about this soundtrack that feels very like big and awe inspiring and not something you would think that you would get out of a top down 2D turn based game that looks like, you know, graphics are from like 40 years ago kind of deal.
34:41
Coming to one point O soon, more than just to stay tuned.
We're actually like basically going to play this immediately once the one point O comes out.
We would have already done it by now.
I own it.
I played a little bit of it.
34:57
I'm ready to play it again for real and listen to this beautiful soundtrack.
Yeah, I've been.
This track has definitely a dungeon synth type sound to me, which I appreciate.
And of course that genre's all all about atmosphere.
35:16
And I can, I can, even though I haven't played Caves of Quid yet, it's I can, I can definitely envision, definitely imagine how that very much complements the gameplay and the the graphics here for it, here for it.
35:32
Yeah, I think it it should also be noted that this is this is the music that plays when you have arrived at Bethesda Souza, which is a a major dungeon in the game that is, is like this very like oppressive, difficult, like cryogenic layer that, you know, you it just, it feels like a, a, you know, big dungeon, like atmospheric epic dungeon like you would see in like a really big crunchy RPG.
36:03
And the fact that it's it's it's, you know, in this super low budget indie title, I think really underscores like why this game is so high quality.
Yeah, let's let's move on to to our next super indie soundtrack.
We'll be playing our previous episode, Rogue Tower.
36:22
This track is Orcs Attack.
37:40
We're listening to the continuously shredding tunes of Rogue Tower or Orcs Attack, composed by Andrew R Mason, the solo dev and composer for this game from previous episode Rogue Tower.
37:57
Yeah, I think for in that episode, I, I may have had some pushback.
Like, yeah, the game's interface isn't super great and I don't know if the game plays for me, but I love the soundtrack.
Like the second we played this, I could just see those little voxelized or dancing back and forth coming into my mind field.
38:15
And I just see the laser pyramids shooting and everything and like, it just.
It sets me right in the game and you know, the Andrew Mason, the developer of this game, so he studied applied mathematics, is a guitarist, AD and D player and a martial artist.
38:33
And I feel like that kind of, you know, eclectic skill set kind of comes in through through the tunes here to some degree.
I think this rogue tower has a lot of fun soul to it and this kind of, I don't know, it's not it's not black metal, it's Bach metal is what I wrote down in in my Google doc.
38:55
It's very similar in in kind of theme to to the artist Stradivarius.
So.
Bach metal, yeah, absolutely.
Which is all the more appropriate cause of course, lots of metals, of course, influenced and dependent upon classical music.
39:13
And yeah, somebody else here.
You're not the only one, Scott, making that observation.
Great minds think alike.
Chim, Chim here in the comments on YouTube is saying, Oh yeah, Stradivarius, Black Diamond, good song, good song.
And yeah, the orcs are attacking and they are attacking with those blast beats, those slightly, you know, maybe less intense blast beats, but blast beats none the less.
39:38
Love that double bass drum.
It's good stuff.
Good stuff.
And I just want to reiterate that I don't even like tower defense games, but Rogue Tower's pretty fun.
I like that every song in the soundtrack there is no build up in any of them.
39:55
They just start off like right in the main melody and it's like such a such a context clue for the game.
Like the first couple notes of each of the songs is like.
OK, this is when shit, I haven't gotten the things that do shield damage yet.
40:14
OK.
Oh no, like each of them have like such a visceral like context to them of like either you're you're like, I'm ready, I'm ready for the next thing or I'm about to die.
OK, our next Super Indeed track that we have on here is a a game that we haven't played yet, but a stay tuned and a half.
40:36
We have, I guess, the main theme from the game Path of Accra.
41:35
The.
41:54
You're listening to the main theme, I think the title theme from the traditional rogue like that's kind of set the, the sub sub sub genre on fire.
Half of Akra composed by the solo developer of the game ulf Sire, this is, this is a game that I, I saw a lot of hype getting around.
42:18
Like, yeah, I think that like the art style's kind of cool.
And then I booted up like hit with this sort of Mesopotamian Akkadian like dulcimer pluck string sound that is just you don't you don't hear this in like games.
42:35
And like the the really like low like one bit style, like growling of of like this of this chorus.
I think like sent me back to like almost Super Metroid levels of like you have this like haunting, haunting kind of dungeon atmosphere.
42:56
But I feel like this game just like sends me back in time to some like era of like 5000 BC where, you know, there were people walking around with, you know, the electric, you know, dual wielding electric katanas and and praying to to all sorts of blood gods and.
43:17
Stuff but also writing is forbidden sacred magic that's just been discovered.
Exactly, Yeah, yeah, this game, I feel like I, I play this game on the couch on Butte a lot and I feel like I shouldn't.
And this is this is a game that like when the developer like for the longest time this was just like like one track that was just like repeated every 5 minutes or something like this is pretty good.
43:41
Like it's, it's like so good.
And then he released like a few other tracks that are like equally as dark and like maybe more brooding, if you can believe it.
And I was like, oh, this is it's just, it's so perfect.
Like I feel like I can listen to an entire album of just this.
43:58
Like ancient brutal Crescent Sumerian blood God lore music.
Yeah, I, I was definitely digging it.
I like to know, as you said, like, you know, super like unique.
That's something you hear in a lot of songs like that.
44:17
It's, it's kind of chuckling to myself just 'cause I was sort of delighted and surprised by some of the notes that were being hit.
It's like, well, that's, that's novel.
That's novel.
Wow.
But it all, it all works.
And yeah, like how kind of staccato it was.
44:32
And I can see that again, you know, I don't know.
It brings to mind the the clacking of the keys on an old time keyboard playing a a proper old school rogue like game.
Right, well, Speaking of old school Rolex, our our next one is possibly one of the biggest Titans of the genre that I think really kind of re catapulted it out of the darkness of the 90s and into the to the modern era.
45:00
Up next we have the the remastered main theme to Dwarf Fortress.
45:37
The the, the the.
47:18
You are listening to the main theme of Dwarf Fortress, the recently remastered Kit Fox Games version remastered with audio by Dabu Omar Dabuis Dab dabus for Kickbox.
47:37
And yeah, if I had to think of a like what is the main theme to the genre of rogue likes, it would have to be that strummed guitar sequence from the intro to Dwarf Fortress where even even with.
This where the dwarf like that's that.
47:55
That little intro thing is just so burning in my brain.
Yeah, I I'm, I'm very glad they left that in.
But yeah, like I, I spent, I don't know, maybe I would guess 300 hours in the original Dwarf Fortress where booting it up every time and, and hearing that main menu plucked strings theme and, and this remastered version with these haunting how like howling like minor tones of like, oh, I'm down in the mines.
48:28
I'm howling away picking, picking at this, these this rock salt wall there.
There's just a, a theme of, of again, scope, scope that you wouldn't think that would be in such a, a game and of something of this legacy.
48:47
So I'm really happy that the original Dorfour just I think just had like 2 songs and there is like 2 full albums of music for the for the remaster.
And it's just it's such high quality that I feel like we could just do an an entire show on on just that it.
49:05
It alone is worth the steam release, although I guess every part of it is worth the steam release, like the the graphics, the the UI and the music.
Each one on its own would have been like a huge compliment to the original game.
49:21
Stay tuned and 1/2 for sure.
We would not be doing our journalistic prudence if we didn't cover Dwarf Fortress at some point.
OK, our next game is one of the most popular rogue light games that has possibly ever come out.
49:38
This next game is Risk of Rain 2:00 and we are playing the track The Rain formerly known as Purple.
The the, the, the, the.
52:32
You are listening to The Rain formerly known as Purple, composed by Chris Cristadulu for Risk of Rain Two and Wow, another game that I really cannot separate the music from the game when I'm playing it.
52:48
And I I have to play this game while listening to the music.
Even the first Risk of Rain composed by by Chris as well.
Just phenomenal soundtracks for a game of, you know, running around like an alien landscape, this big hostile environment, these bombastic guitar tunes that really set this this really epic scope of of your mission that you're on.
53:16
I think risk of rain one was already one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time.
I think risk of rain two is even better.
Somehow.
There have been numerous times where I've been running around in this game being chased by like 100 monsters and I just like stop to appreciate the music for a second and then just get bludgeoned to death by a giant fire breathing lizard.
53:36
So I think I think worth it this this game is another stay tuned and a half.
Basically all of them are.
But yeah, keep an eye out for this one in the future.
While listening to that track, I just occurred to me, I only need to take a moment to recognize and to appreciate that we are living in a Goldman age of video game music.
54:03
Like just has so many good soundtracks to the point where, I mean, I, I started to feel bad for these devs 'cause it almost feels like a requirement.
It certainly almost feels like a, you know, pseudo requirement for indie games.
Cause it's like the expectation is.
Oh yeah.
Well, obviously, you know, the soundtrack is gonna be worth buying on its own.
54:21
And, and, and you will, even though you're grinding, you know, this game for hours and hours and hours, you better have your podcast and your TV muted.
Turn that stuff.
Turn that the hell off 'cause we got to listen to this great soundtrack.
Sounds very good.
54:36
I'm always down for, you know, synthy type stuff.
Big fan of synth in general, you know, dark synth, all that jazz and love, love the melody.
Very melodic, very enjoyable.
Yeah, I think it adds a lot to the vibes of both of the games, the insignificance in the large landscape full of monsters that are trying to bludgeon you.
55:00
The good timing with the the the 40th anniversary of Prince's Purple Rain album dropping last week, playing some some rain, formerly known as Purple this week.
Yeah, I think, I think these, these games might not be everyone's jam, but boy, the soundtrack, Sure, jammin, that's for sure.
55:19
All right.
Up next is our Jammin, I guess main menu theme.
There's really only kind of 1 theme to this game that's remixed several times, but this is this is the main theme for Bellatro.
55:45
The the, the the.
58:08
You're listening to the main theme from Bellatro composed by Louis F and wow, yeah, I can't think.
When we first played this game previous episode, by the way, Mulatro, this this theme was stuck in my head for basically the whole 2 weeks before we recorded.
58:32
And it was just like this inescapable presence of like, I'd be sitting there in the kitchen chopping onions and then all of a sudden humming like the main theme to this.
And gosh, it's, it's so it's so good.
And like, especially with with this part where it like it, it dials down into this like like lower, kind of like stinky calmer section.
58:57
There have been times where I've been sitting at work and trying to noodle through like a really tough puzzle.
And then just thinking through this like Bellatro music just comes playing on the background like, Oh yes, this is very focusing in Zen like, and how do I rearrange my cards in order to do this thing?
59:12
And it's just, it's, it's so foundational, I think to the to the game that I understand, like people who can play this game on mute and yeah, if you're playing this game like on the bus or something, but like.
You should be playing with headlines and listening to music.
59:29
Yeah, you, you really owe it to yourself to like, play through this game at least at least once, listening to the soundtrack, I think.
I stopped away to get a beer while we were listening and it didn't matter because once I heard the soundtrack it just started playing in my brain and I didn't need to hear it.
59:44
It was my ears anymore.
Yeah, there, there, there you go.
I I appreciate how Bellatro has What's unique about the the soundtrack is that it has this sort of psychedelic groove to it.
1:00:00
And that is, of course, also portrayed in the art style and visuals.
And, you know, once again, we're just, you know, we're covering a lot of songs that are that complement the game just so wonderfully.
And I assume Scott, this is the the radio edit 19 minutes, 49 seconds.
1:00:23
Yeah, I think the the like there's so many, there's a few different themes in this game.
You like when you go into the shop, you open up different packs of cards and when you're fighting bosses in this game, but it's all like roughly the same kind of theme, but like remixed in like a very intelligent way.
1:00:42
And I feel like it really like this this game has such a good thinky vibe to it, but also like a thinky, funky vibe to it.
Like a funky vibe.
Maybe this is where local Thunk gets is a developer named from.
But but like, yeah, like it is, it is.
1:00:58
So it is so Zen.
That baseline is so deadly of just the like, like it is it is just resonating.
Yeah.
And I think that like, you know, Bellatro owes a lot of its a lot of its success to its aesthetic.
1:01:16
And this helps a lot like the like, you know, the the visual aesthetic is slam dunk.
The audio is like perfect.
And you see a lot of these kind of fast follow games like, Oh, well, Bilatro was successful.
Maybe I could do something but Yahtzee or or, you know, other other like or like a craps table version of Bilatro.
1:01:35
But does it have this kind of soul to it?
Does it have this kind of like, you know, funk vibe aesthetic?
Hard to say.
You know, I think this this helps really like this is the reason why this game is so different and so unique and interesting.
Well, with that, we're going to jump back to another Titan of the rogue like genre.
1:01:58
We're diving down into some depths here way back in the past to revisit a game that kind of kind of kick started the whole new renaissance of of real time rogue light action type games.
1:02:16
This is Yeti Caves from Spelunky.
1:02:52
The.
1:03:14
You're listening to the Yeti Caves stage from Spelunky, composed by I'm going to get this totally wrong.
I I Rick Sirki is my best guess at this and another just super funky soundtrack.
1:03:33
I don't know, Colin, if if you.
Or.
Or you Andrew, haven't had played it, but I have done dumped a lot of hours into Spelunky or in this case spell funky.
Oh, yeah, And it was actually, it's good timing that Molly is trying to jump on the keyboard and meow into the microphone because I almost can't hear this soundtrack without a lot of these stages have rescueable characters that will give you help points and you can set it to be a a pug.
1:04:04
And so you'll hear you'll hear the pug kind of like howling throughout the stage.
And I'm listening to this.
I'm like, what is the pug music in here?
Or it's just kind of baked into my brain.
So the cat making an appearance is is quite apropos.
1:04:19
Good timing.
Yeah.
This is another case of the soundtrack being oh, like Colin, if you haven't played Spelunky, how would you describe the gameplay of of this based on the soundtrack?
Well, I know you go into a cave and you go down, so I'm assuming at some point you dig your way into a jazz lounge.
1:04:39
That's pretty.
Obviously it's another rhythm game based.
On this smooth rhythm game, though, you're sliding everywhere on a shovel.
Absolutely sliding and just being, you know, such a cool cat, dextrous, never sliding down onto some spikes or anything else.
1:04:58
Or embarrassing like that your dead body onto the the altar of of Kali.
But yeah, this this is another game where like the soundtrack is like, oh, this is a a fun hip hopin kind of kind of time.
And the game being the most brutal, unforgiving take on Mario you've ever seen.
1:05:18
Yeah, I think this this is is another case where the the games aesthetic and just overall great gameplay is really why it deserves so much of its of its success.
Another another game that we could spend, you know, an entire show doing the soundtrack for this one and it's sequel, Spelunky 2 very, very well put together.
1:05:42
This next game that we're continuing our funk segment with a little lesser known, definitely very crazy this one is feel the rhythm, the music man theme from Brutal Orchestra.
1:07:22
The the the.
1:08:22
You're listening to feel the rhythm, the rhythm, the music Man theme composed by Publiio Delgado for Rutal Orchestra.
When?
Well, when?
Too bad a Will's not here.
I mean, come on, he's got to play this game, that's what.
1:08:37
I appreciate I've heard this song in his apartment, maybe not actually, but like.
Just that's the ambient music just plays in his abode.
Hell yeah.
Yeah, this is, you know, I usually have a a jazzy intro segment to all of our podcast episodes because can't come up with a theme so that that's good enough.
1:08:57
And compiling the playlist for this, I was like, OK, I'm definitely going to pick this game.
Definitely going to pick this one.
What about what about this one?
And then I started listening through the brutal orchestra soundtrack.
I'm like, whoa, this is jazz to the Max.
1:09:14
And we are bebopping and scatting all over the place.
And I almost had this one as the as the intro to keep that kind of jazzy intro theme going, but I had to it just barely lost out of Vampire survivors.
Yeah, this is this game is wild.
1:09:31
There is not many times you hear earthbound rogue like purgatory murder, revenge in the same sentence.
But you got it in spades here.
And this game is all, all kinds of wild, like the the the art and music I think really helped to set for such a unique gaming experience with this and like such unique gameplay mechanics as well.
1:09:59
Like it's a very it's almost kind of like a a party based RPG style deck builder question mark in a way.
There's a lot of weird stuff going on in this one.
And I would not be shocked if if we if we wind up covering this at some point in the future as well.
1:10:15
But yeah, this, this game's whole soundtrack is just we'll have.
To play it just for the music.
We'll we'll do a an episode, yeah, where we'll just be like, well, we we're gonna play it, but we got.
Distracted by just.
Listening to the.
Whole Oh no, I'm looking at the the gameplay and I will tell you this isn't what I expected graphics wise or just visual aesthetic wise.
1:10:41
Yeah, it is like a Ren and Stimpy melting, like you're in like a Madame Tussauds and the heat is turned up too much and like it is.
I have to like an that's we're here for the audio.
We're not here for the visual description because this game cannot be visually described.
1:10:57
You have to go to the Steam page and you have to like be like what on God's name is this OK, Our next episode.
Nope.
We'll fix it in post.
We'll fix it in post.
It's OK.
Well, our next entry here as a familiar title to many, this is the Enter the Gungeon theme from Take a Guess, Enter the Gungeon.
1:11:49
Holster Ride Dragon.
Body the floor.
1:12:48
The.
1:13:05
None.
1:13:29
That is the spitting fire of Enter the Gungeon by American rapper Doze.
One for the game.
Enter the Gungeon.
How many rogue likes have rap songs and like want to come at it's it's too good.
1:13:48
And what's so ingenious about this track, I feel like is that the the beginning of it, like plays in the main menu.
And you know, you play the game so often, you know, you get familiar with this main this main menu track.
1:14:04
But it's not until the very end of the game when you are have a successful run that it then starts playing right about at the one minute mark, which goes after a little while of like, you know, the groove that used to into the the wrap and which at a certain point starts just like quoting the game mechanics and like quoting specific items that are in the game.
1:14:29
And it's just like delightful.
And every time, every time I, I, you know, have a successful run, a victory run, I just, you know, let it play and, you know, do a little, do a little jig around my household.
That explains why this didn't sound very familiar to me.
1:14:45
Indeed, indeed.
But it's like it's such a a fun treat and a fun way to celebrate your successful run.
And I didn't even know, yeah, like I didn't even know that there was a rap to this when I was assembling the play out music for our previous episode of Enter the Gungeon that we covered.
1:15:03
I just thought it was just the enter Enter the Gungeon like lyrics part.
And then you suggested like, oh, we gotta we gotta do the rap part.
I'm like there's a rap part.
And then like, Oh my God, there's like they actually got like a real professional rapper to do this.
And like you can tell like it is, it is like.
1:15:20
It's got bars, that's for sure.
And I'm, I ain't talking about the World War Two, you know, the rifle or heavy infantry support, whatever it's called, I don't know.
Anyway, 20 bullets in the magazine.
What were they thinking?
Yeah, it's, it's a lot of fun.
It's it's a good one and it's again very, you know, cathartic musically to hear that, especially the first time now it's been spoiled.
1:15:46
Well, continuing with the the rare treat of lyrics at the end of victory screens in rogue like games or or rogue, let's let's put this in the rogue adjacent honorary rogue is what I have it tagged on the on the.
Site I I take it back, it's a good thing Will's not here, so we're not sparking off another really, you know, contentious debate.
1:16:06
This next track is waiting for the sun from Rim World.
Gotta.
1:16:30
Leave it all behind can just burn and blow your mind.
Waiting, waiting for the sun.
How many seasons passed you by?
1:16:53
Were you glad just to be alive?
Waiting, Waiting for the sun, the.
1:17:36
You're listening to Waiting for the Sun, composed by Alistair Lindsay for Rimworld.
Yeah, this is this is another one that I don't I'm not sure if I have much hope of of getting to the end of to see the credit screen of being quite that skilled at Rimworld.
1:17:53
But Colin, in the innumerable times that you've beaten this game, is this does this feel like a cathartic moment when you finally launched off of this hellish landscape?
I'm trying to remember if I think I've only beaten it once and I don't think they had this song at the end.
1:18:12
When I beat it, I don't normally get to the end.
I normally just get bored of the colony because, you know, it's like, oh, I'm just doing some stuff and then like the end game stuff is usually like it's, it's a a slog to get to, you know, getting off the world and whatever.
1:18:30
But yeah, I don't know.
I.
Feel I feel like the Rimworld soundtrack overall is is quite calming for a game that for like a game that you know you're, you're basically like staying alive by like skinning visitors who come by alive to sell their pelts to to other nearby colonies.
1:18:52
Yeah, I do.
I do like how relatively upbeat the song is.
But as you.
Finished your run and you're reflecting on all the all the awful beads that.
You have all the war crimes you've committed for your hitches.
I mean, for all that gets played up in the comments, I rarely skinned people for human leather couches.
1:19:12
All right, well, continuing our space Western interlude here, we are next going to the main menu theme from Lone Star.
1:20:18
The the.
1:21:11
You're listening to the main menu theme from Lone Star composed, I think, composed by Kung You Bing SAT Chao with quite a number of accompanying musicians here.
1:21:28
Not quite sure which of them is playing the harmonica, but woo, this is this is, I think, quite, quite at home with something like Rim world, where very space western kind of theme to it.
And this was Will's pick, even though he's not here.
1:21:45
This was Will's pick is like, yes, this has to be in here.
And you know, he remarked on our previous episode of Lone Star.
This he thought was like the best soundtrack to many of the games that we've that we've covered so far.
So high praise on that front.
And yeah, I think like this game is still in early access by the time that we're recording right now.
1:22:04
I think it should hit one point O some point in 2024.
But I love this vibe, like this space western harmonica bounty hunter vibe.
And I really hope that there's like that there's more of this in this game and just more of this in general.
1:22:20
I feel like this is, it's such a good out on the edge of the of the Galaxy.
You know, you're, you're playing your harmonica on the outside of your spaceship kind of thing.
It feels, it feels very at home in this kind of aesthetic.
Yeah, I mean, they definitely were trying to make this a space Western, and this is the thing that made it that without the soundtrack, it would have been the space Western theme would have been pretty thin.
1:22:45
But this cements it solidly as that. 100% It's important to, you know, set the tone when a game gets, you know, booted up and it really succeeds, just as does a great job.
1:23:03
All right, we're rounding the corner here.
We have some final boss themes to round us out, and our first boss theme for this little bit here is Leshie's theme from the game inscription.
1:23:27
The the.
1:25:13
You're listening to the incredibly powerful Leshies theme from Inscription, composed by Jonah Senzel.
And wow, when I booted this up I was instantly taken back to that boss fight.
1:25:29
And I know Andrew has not had the pleasure of playing Inscription yet, I don't think.
Yeah, I can only assume that it's a survival horror game, right?
That's.
The other horror aspect there pretty.
Nice scoopy track.
Important, important It's important to note ABS the the the least amount possible to when you go in playing this game, except for that it is a I think I have it as like a 9.5 out of 10.
1:25:53
So it would be like top top four games of mine.
Normally we say a game is a is a stay tuned.
If we're like, yeah, we'll get to it eventually.
This is a game that we are we are getting to this season because.
Oh.
Oh, I don't know.
1:26:10
We'll have to talk about this.
I don't know if we should review it.
I don't think that we should talk about it because I don't think anyone should hear things about it before they play it.
It's.
A Cognito hazard.
Well, we'll, we'll publish the episode and then we'll lock it down so that way no one can actually hear it.
This is this inscription for for those in Andrew's position is a game that it's a it's a rogue like deck builder, but there's so many, there's so many interesting aspects to it that if someone told you about him, it would ruin the surprise.
1:26:41
So if nothing else, I'm, I'm excited to, to see what Andrew's reaction to those things from a fresh perspective would be.
And, and this, this boss fight that you encounter in the game is so, so tense and so atmospheric and so artistically done that like up into this point, like it, it's, it's a very different game.
1:27:07
And then this hits and it just it's everything starts spinning on its head and it is like you hear this in the music with some of the the motifs written back for some of the mini bosses that you fight.
And it is just so perfectly tied together for that atmospheric horror vibe.
1:27:27
And then after you beat the game, much like Returnal, you beat the game and you come back to it with this renewed sense of context.
And you're like, obviously the less said the better here, but but yeah, keep an keep an eye out for for the soundtrack to to appear later this season.
1:27:46
All right, our next boss fight is quite, quite a, quite a boss fight from rogue likes in general.
The next this next piece of music is the last stand from FTL, Faster Than Light.
1:29:28
The the.
1:30:16
You're listening to The Last Stand from FTL Faster Than Light, composed by Ben Prunty who also did the the soundtrack to the other Subset games game Into the Breach, both FTL and Into the Brief Into the Breach previous episodes.
1:30:33
And boy, this boss fight this is.
This is some boss fight music, maybe one of like the the titular I I keep saying this about all the games like, you know this, this has such a perfect boss fight theme where you are the lowly Federation ship, building up your crew and building up your weapons to finally take on the the rebel flagship at the end.
1:30:57
And I can't think of a better like Titanic showdown music of just like pause.
Let me think for a second.
Where do I want my fire laser to go to cause maximum damage?
But I gotta watch out for the for the hacking drones like this is this is you are on the bridge of the Starship and you are having to enact all of your your tactics and all of your defense strategies.
1:31:24
Your Shields are at maximum.
This is.
It's just such a perfect final boss fight theme.
Oh yeah, In my case, it's like that alternate timeline and Star Trek the Next Gen. where like the Borg have taken over and Rikers got like a big Grizzly Adams beard.
1:31:42
Wharf is hanging out and he looks pretty normal.
But anyway, yeah, we've covered a lot of songs that it's like, oh, I haven't gotten to that part yet because it's too far out of the game.
I've definitely gotten to this part.
I've lost every time and it has been the Last Stand for me, so it is very apropos.
I feel like the, the only thing that the soundtrack is missing or this, this version is missing is that of like the the missile alarm, like it's deeply ingrained in my brain that that is part of this song.
1:32:12
And it's not it's it's a warning, but like it triggers that that sound in my head.
Missiles incoming.
Warning intruders aboard the sound of the of the doors opening and you're trying to put out all the fires on your ship and trying to to launch missiles.
1:32:28
And it, the, the theme is so good for how how much of an epic last stand showdown it really is.
It's it's just so perfect.
Like all of the, all of the Ben Prunty tunes from MTL and end of the breach are just so, so on point.
And I think in our end of the breach episode, we've mentioned that we didn't have like an epic Titanic showdown of like A1V1 super battle.
1:32:51
And this is like this is it.
This is the possibly the boss fight.
But you know, we can't go we can't go an episode of the show without referencing Slater spider somehow.
And if Will was here, he would say, well, you think the the FTL final boss is the final boss.
1:33:12
This next one is maybe the final boss of of maybe all rogue legs.
This is this next track is the heart from Slay the Spire.
1:34:48
The.
1:35:09
You are listening to the heart from Slay the Spire composed by Clark Abood.
I am not good at Slay the Spire.
I have only just really gotten to the point of collecting 3 keys that you need for a run in order to get to the heart and it baffles me.
1:35:25
It sounds me that people can get to this super colossal, epic boss fight that you have no hope of winning on a difficulty level that is just like so painful that I can't even begin to imagine the skill required to beat the heart on Ascension 20.
1:35:43
That will is just like, yeah, it's no problem.
What's the deal?
And this music, I think is just the the boss fight music for this game that like you get to you get to like an end of end of an act boss.
1:35:58
Like, yeah, that was OK.
This is boss music, capital B boss, the big thumping horn segments.
This is it just jumps with the rhythm of just the giant demon heart that is just going to pound you into pound you out of the out of the realm of of mortals and you know, send you flying down to the ground to talk to the the the sentient whale all over again.
1:36:24
Well, and it does the thing that I love about boss fight music, which is take the main theme or one of the main themes or all the motifs from all the other things and just mash them together and turn them to 11.
It's just it's like, Oh yeah, with the culmination of things.
And I mean, I feel like most boss music does that, but I really like when they do it and I think this does a good job of.
1:36:46
This a great trick.
Absolutely.
It's that culmination of of the game and that includes the the soundtrack.
And for my brain, like when I'm like, you know, listening to music, you know, I'm generally speaking, I'm enjoying a particular track at maximum when I have listened to it a number of times and it has had time to sort of percolate and marinade in my brain.
1:37:15
And so you, you when you call upon those melodies and those those themes from earlier in the game, you are sort of delving into that and using that resource.
It's like, oh, it's this is sure to be a catchy good tune for the player because their brain already kind of knows it.
1:37:33
And this is very bombastic, not not in a bad way, but a very, very dramatic and exciting and this is like, you know, triple-A big budget blockbuster music type type of a sound.
I can dig it.
It is the Ascension 20 of rogue like music.
1:37:52
Well, you'll notice.
Well, yeah, I guess that that kind of wraps up our our Summer Music Fest episode.
You'll notice that this this recording isn't quite done yet.
We still have some listener emails that we'll be reading through after this is wrapped up.
So stay tuned for that if you are still awake.
1:38:11
But yeah, for the purpose of, of our summer beach jams, we'll, we'll wrap this up in, in sort of the usual way that they, yeah, if you want to get in, contact Grog Pod zone@gmail.com is the e-mail address.
Grog Pod dot zone is the website with all of our stuff.
1:38:27
And we're on Mastodon with, with 10s of other people or Grog Pod again, Dev dot plays.
You can find all that stuff right in send us send us some stuff for our for our next letter episode.
And our next episode that we'll be covering is a listener request week.
1:38:45
It is our 50th game that we will be reviewing and actually 50th and 51st because we're viewing the two for one.
We've talked a lot about great games and great game music, and you've heard our next episode here earlier.
1:39:00
We're gonna be revisiting the timeless classic Doom, the roguelike Doom RL and its modern remaster by the same developer Jupiter Hell.
So keep an eye out for for that for our next episode.
And so the play out this part of this will get you in the mood for doom with some 90s demon hunting inspired tunes from our Theremin heavy Hades.
1:39:29
And playing us out this week will be the Track King and the Bull from Hades, composed by Darren Cord.
1:40:41
The None None.
1:42:14
OK, and if you are still listening to the podcast, we have some listener letters to go through.
First off, thanks people for considering to write into a video game podcast and have us talk about it.
1:42:30
We got some some interesting stuff in here to talk through I think.
So let's just jump right into it.
This first letter we got from our Risk of Rain episode go on to say I found out about the pod and I'm going back currently.
1:42:48
I appreciate that y'all let someone share that they don't like the game.
I'm about to go for another attempt on Risk of Rain and I remember not getting why people liked it so much in the past.
It is acceptable for people not to have a game click for them.
1:43:04
And it is good to hear opinions from all sides on what makes a good a game good or fun.
I just had the Google Docs thing pop up and I have to restart.
And that is from our listener Cheese Cola.
1:43:20
Thanks Mr. or Misses Cheese for writing in.
And yeah, I, I wanted to include this one specifically because I think there's there's a lot of games that we talked about and not every one of them is going to be a slam dunk.
And and yeah, like, like she the wise words of cheese cola.
1:43:40
That's perfectly acceptable.
Or even if.
They are a slam dunk.
Maybe they're not a slam dunk for everyone.
That's true.
There can be games that Will has liked and I haven't liked and more vice versa.
Yeah, certainly.
And I mean it's it's it's a tough, it's a tough trick for a game to pull off where it's like, oh, you gotta please all four hosts.
1:44:01
That's not gonna happen in a four host with a wide variety of tastes.
And of course, I mean, clearly this, you know, e-mail is specifically complimenting Will, so it's a shame that he's not here again.
1:44:20
Well, yeah.
And I think that like there's, there's also some Mia Culpa as a, as a host here trying to spread the good word of the pod into some places where it's like, hey, you know, we didn't like this game, but come listen to us talk about it, which I've dialed back significantly.
1:44:40
I, I remember there was this one, there was this one game developer somewhere who was saying like, you know, I, I love hearing people talk about this game that I've developed, regardless if they like it or not, because people are still talking about it.
And I, I was like, oh, I wonder, you know, if, if that rings true for communities.
1:44:59
And I don't, I don't actually think that's true for communities anymore.
But, but yeah, I think that like after our Lone Star episode, I think we were kind of, we were kind of like neutral positive on Lone Star.
I went into the Lone Star Discord and, and shared our episode saying like, Hey, you know, I think we generally liked it.
1:45:15
And one of the posters there said, you know, hey, I'm like 30 minutes through the episode.
When do you guys get to start talking about something positive here?
And I just felt, I just felt like a huge jerk, like, you know, I've like infiltrated these safe spaces for these communities cuz a lot of.
1:45:32
You jump through the emoji hoops required to get into the discord and you're not a bot and then?
I read the server rules, but yeah, I think a lot of these games are communities, and a lot of the communities you go to for games are people who are diehard fans.
1:45:50
So yeah, of course if you post something, I remember our Shattered Pixel Dungeon episode.
Got a?
Lot.
Oh yeah, I was actually gonna say that's the that's been our worst offender because we didn't like it and people really like that game.
So yeah.
And yeah, they're like, I, I think to be clear, our, our aggregate rankings have it as kind of like, yeah, it's like it's in the middle, in the middle of the pack.
1:46:10
And you know, for people who have put 1000 hours into a game, they'd be like, you only kind of like it.
But yeah, I think, yeah.
The immortal words of cheese Cola.
It's good to hear opinions from all sides on what makes a game.
Indeed, Cheese cola.
1:46:25
Thank you.
You're a true gentle person and a scholar.
And sometimes it feels kind of bad, bad mouthing a game or or speaking negatively about a game.
So it's it's good to hear that listeners such as yourself find that valuable.
1:46:41
And I agree a a variety of opinions makes for a better discussion, of course.
Yeah, it would be.
It'd be super boring if we just Yep, this, this game is great.
Yep, this game is great.
All right, all right, let's move on to our next letter.
1:46:57
We got got a whole bunch of stuff here still.
This one is from our Star of Providence podcast episode.
This one reads, Hey you fellas, it's Nick, one of the two guys from the Upgraded Terminal podcast, Star of Providence podcast.
First of all, huge thanks for the shout out at the end of the episode.
1:47:15
They're very much appreciated as someone who makes an extremely niche thing, one niche thing podcast through to another.
Secondly, thank you for giving more attention and discussion about Star of Providence.
Love it to pieces.
The podcast was a lot of fun.
1:47:31
It's always interesting to get a new perspective, especially from those outside the community.
I didn't didn't intend to have a theme here, but they're going to say it's refreshing to have.
It's refreshing to get that every so often.
I'm glad you all enjoyed the game.
Thirdly, yes, there is more content in the work.
1:47:48
New stuff, rebalancing, perhaps some quality of life stuff that's coming with the Nintendo Switch version coming someday, hopefully before Silksong.
That's where my expectations are anyway.
Cheers.
And that is from Nick from 1/2 of the Upgrade Terminal Star of Providence podcast.
1:48:07
Well, yes, thank you, Nick.
As it turns out, the Star of Providence switch release is slated for February 2025.
S certainly.
Before Silk Song, Yeah, if.
If there's if the century begins with A2, it's gonna be before Silk Song.
1:48:25
So yeah, I'm excited.
I think the the when I first played Star Providence, I'm like, yeah, this game is amazing.
And then DLC came out for it.
I'm like, wow, this is even more amazing.
Like look at all this extra stuff they added.
So I'm super excited to see what what more they have coming down the pipe.
1:48:42
Indeed, I I've been actively playing it quite a bit recently actually.
It is a lot of fun and more content outstanding and I commend Nick and his crew for having such a specific podcast.
1:48:59
That is, I, I I really admire that.
I don't remember the shout out, Scott, had you like found their podcast and listened to them and just as a way to like get tips or something?
Yeah, I mean, it's a it's it's a, a podcast with a ton of content for one single game.
1:49:19
And I have to doff my hat at them for for being so in depth for so long on it.
And it was, it was very helpful for me to understand like more about the game and like tips and things and like speed running communities and like, Oh my God, I had no idea that like you could do this very like crucial thing in the game.
1:49:40
And yeah, it was, it was just like super in depth and, and eye opening.
And I think I put it at the end of that episode as like a like a part of the more to explore the.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So like here's some similar games and if you if you love this Star of Providence episode that we did, go check out these guys for 30 more hours of content on it.
1:50:01
Outstanding.
Well hopefully some of those 30 hours has some tips and tricks on the hacking mini game 'cause I am still after like 20-5 hours of playing this game so bad at it I just lose.
That hacking mini game is like the most stressful experience in like in like all the Elman ring I've been playing recently and like boy, this isn't this isn't the star province hacking game at least.
1:50:25
I, I imagine that it gets easier once you like, understand immediately when you see the puzzle, but it's this like frantic, like, what is this puzzle?
Try and understand it.
Oh God, I've already used half the time.
Yeah, I'd be like one of those gorillas at the computer monitor that like is pressing all the buttons super fast.
1:50:41
Yeah.
OK, well yeah, thanks Nick.
Our next letter here is from our Enter the Gungeon episode.
Listener writes in to say thanks for the EP.
Fun discussion as always.
Seems like the consensus among you guys is that Gungeons a very roll the die and get good with what you have affair.
1:51:02
I can see how the RNG dependent gameplay, lack of strategic agency is a downside for some of you.
But to offer an alternative point of view which I think Scott or Andrew touched on.
Actually kind of like that about Gungen and some other rogue likes.
To me it feels like spinning a wacky wheel of fortune.
1:51:20
Think dream machines in the Yakuza games or dipping your hand into a mystery grab bag of toys.
There's an excitement and anticipation in what guns all get in this chest, and I might get a boring or ineffective gun or something that I can't use at all, but that just means I can pat myself on the back for taking on Gungeon with a lesser load out.
1:51:38
I guess it's the difference between a a glass half full and glass half empty mindset.
I also look at the availability of strategic agency in another light.
If I don't have the choices to strategize from, that's one less layer of thinking I have to do.
I'm lazy and I don't have the mental energy to strategize it after a long day.
1:51:56
Sympathize there.
I can live with pulling the lever on a slot machine and feeling jazzed about whatever reward I get.
Awesome or lame.
Honestly, these two points may be the core reasons why I love this genre.
Maybe I'm just a foolish gambler at heart.
I probably shouldn't ever go to casinos.
And that's from Rell's re Rell's Rey Rell, I think is what they is what they go by.
1:52:21
Yeah, I think like this, this is like the time time honored debate with a lot of stuff is like how do you how do you balance between randomness but not too much random And I I don't quite know where that balancing act is.
1:52:37
And in some cases, you know, you can have things like, like we, we already talked about our risk of rain episode, but the risk of rain series has this where, you know, you, you go in and you open a chest and it's like, ah, here's some random thing, but there's options that you can make it so when you open the chest, ah, now I can pick from anything.
1:52:57
And you have the option to actually strategically build your load out as like a, as an option you can unlock later.
So yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of curious from the peanut gallery here, like where do we think the the balancing point is between like maybe like good random and bad random?
1:53:16
Yeah, I wish we sorry, I wish we had like a a date that we had done these podcasts on here cuz I feel like this was one of the earlier ones that we had done.
Yeah, like this was back when Andrew was still just a guest.
Indeed, it's true correctly.
1:53:32
My recollection is that Woody and I were like very kind of pro the level of randomization and that's when like Hades came up and and how y'all were discussing, well, you know what's great about Hades?
Instead, at the end of a room you get you know those those options so that you can try to build towards a particular build.
1:53:53
Yeah, I think it it am I as like I have not listened to this podcast or this episode since it came out.
So my bet would be that if I went back and listened to it now, I would probably say that I've learned more about myself as a gamer since then.
1:54:11
But it's probably just that I don't like top down shooters and there was nothing.
The randomness plus or minus is not the part of it that I was dissatisfied.
With that's not your biggest concern.
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
1:54:27
I guess the tricky, the tricky bit about randomness is like when you are surprised and delighted by buy some RNG, then of course it's great.
But you can't have that, you know, without the bad, without getting stuck with, which actually can be a source of entertainment sometimes when you get really just done dirty by the algorithm, by the RNG.
1:54:55
Indeed it is is one of the great questions of our time.
And it's, it's tough to say exactly how to find that balance, but there are, you know, certain games that are able to do it.
And some games lean into one or the other, and that's OK, too.
Yeah, I guess maybe maybe like blending into our next letter a little bit.
I remember I was listening to something and someone made a very like I was listening to another video game podcast.
1:55:15
Don't listen to them, listen to us.
And they were making the point that like games with high degrees of randomness should be shorter and that like, the like a longer game, like the randomness becomes more like punishing.
1:55:32
And I was like, oh, I got to, I got to stop my walk here and take a note down in, in my phone 'cause I was like, yes, this, this feels very on point with this where like, I feel like Gungeon is like, is short enough where, oh, it's like you get some random thing that's just like, yeah, this is going to probably be a, a run killer here.
1:55:49
But you know, it's a, it's a silly banana or, you know, it's something that like probably doesn't work.
Let's see how far I can go with it.
I'm dead.
Yeah, OK, I can start another run, you know, before, before dinner is already kind of a deal.
But if it's like, you know, you're you're like 30 hours into this super epic RPG and you're down to your last life and, you know, you got the dice roll to go and, you know, comes up snake eyes and you're like, well, that was 30 hours.
1:56:17
Yeah.
XCOM.
Yeah.
Oh, that.
Pops into my mind just like, Oh yeah, take that 85% shot.
Oh, you miss.
Oh, I guess I just lose this guy who've been, like, carefully shepherding through 30 hours of gameplay, and now I have to make the decision of, like, do I actually like trying to, like, save scum?
1:56:36
I haven't yet in this whole campaign.
Like, I'm doing a fake Iron Man.
Like, yeah.
Yeah, I think maybe another component with that is like luck.
Luck is probably fine.
Or like randomness is probably fine for those longer games as long as you have like a randomness mitigation method of like, ah, yes, here's more randomness, but here are more ways to like, more strategies or like things you can do to like, plus or minus the pips of the die.
1:57:06
Or like increase your odds of rolling such that, yeah, like, oh, I have an 80% chance of getting this final hit at the final boss.
Ah, but here's like all these potions and things that I can use, like up that to like 110%.
And then that way it's like, OK, like I have some kind of luck mitigation strategies maybe.
1:57:23
Yeah.
Here, here, indeed, yeah, is important.
And I think someone, one of one of our last years wrote in to discuss that topic and I think it's been discussed a little bit previously.
1:57:39
And yeah, I agree also.
All right, we, we've been running a little long here.
Let's let's wrap this up.
Our our last letter here from our our favorite letter writer titled How long do you do you like your game play?
1:57:56
Yeah, they say someone mentioned gameplay length, particularly in regards to just how long Tales of Montreal's Age of Ascendancy campaign the default one was and what is just quote too long.
I've played a decent amount of rogue likes slash rogue lights and see their length.
1:58:14
Their length run the gauntlet quite a bit.
In general I see them in four distinct categories.
Games game runs of less than two hours.
Think Spelunky, Cardinal Quest, and quite a few seven day rogue lake game dev jam projects.
1:58:31
These games are quite short or have runs that will be done and over very quickly.
Usually you can pick them up easily.
Your coffee break rogue lakes kind of thing.
You have two to five hour game runs.
Insert FTL faster than light dungeon at the endless Jupiter.
1:58:46
Hell, in this bracket you might come back to these over a few coffee breaks, but they are likely games you would sit down and play through and start to finish in your average afternoon 5 to 12 hour game runs looking at beefy stuff like Unexplored and Castle of the Winds.
Now while for other brackets you could theoretically get away with not having a save button, you'll likely need it at this point.
1:59:08
Also find these games tend to require you to keep playing them too, otherwise you forget how you'll forget how to play your games.
You've come back to them after too long and then games game runs of more than 12 hours.
Obviously you just played Tales of Magellan, but Dungeon Carl Stone Soup can also be mentioned as another very long game.
1:59:29
The standards for many old school rogue legs, They're just long.
I'm personally finding that 12 plus hour length rogue legs are becoming harder to play as free times becomes scarcer.
To find games that are less than two hours might be fine to play on on my mobile, but I wouldn't want to sit down at APC to play such a game.
1:59:46
I personally like those games that are in the five to 12 hour range, but I actually don't come across such games that often.
Thoughts.
Question mark that is from our good pal Davian.
Right.
And then again, repeat writer.
What a deal.
Good stuff.
2:00:03
Sorry it took so long for us to get to this get to this question.
Tome was a while ago.
I feel like I think we can all agree that the perfect length is a bus ride back from work, right Scott?
I think, well, yes, yes and no.
2:00:18
I think it depends.
Yeah.
I mean, like I am, I am the the poster child of like the, the person on the steam.
You, you see these people all the time with their Steam decks on the bus, you know, kind of thing.
And yeah, I think that, you know, are, are 4 categories of like games, games less than two hours, two to 55 to 12:00 and 12:00 plus.
2:00:39
I think like in terms of, of like bite siziness, you have, well, there, there's, there's so many layers here 'cause it's like you have, how long does it take for you to complete like the little, the little puzzle that you're currently interacting with.
And then there's like the broader puzzle.
2:00:56
And so for something like like FTL, you know, you have like your bite size, like in the moment puzzle, like, oh, I'm fighting this other ship, but your your broader overarching puzzle is, you know, building up your ship and navigating through the different sectors to fight the final boss at the end.
2:01:12
And, you know, like slay the Spire kind of a similar idea.
And but like, you know, you might and that like run length, that overarching thing is a much longer entity versus, you know, your individual fight might last a few minutes at most.
2:01:30
And so.
Yeah.
The unit of rogue like is a run so like from what?
From the beginning of game till death or victory?
So like for FTL, that's what, like two 2 1/2 hours?
2:01:46
Yeah, I can see that.
I think I'm pretty solidly in the like just below 2 hours to four or five hours as my sweet spot of rogue likes.
I'm just looking at the, at the games that I have high on my, my list and I think a lot of them end up with runs that are in that like two or three hour range at most.
2:02:10
I, I, I kind of agree with the like 12 plus hour games.
I, I feel like my experience with them starts being that they're not rogue like for me because I played one run or two runs, in which case, yeah, they might have a lot of replayability, but I won't experience that.
2:02:30
So whatever I happen to do, like Tales of Mahjong, I basically had two runs.
So that has been my, my experience is that it is an RPG.
And I know that's not true.
I know that's not how people who are really into the game experience it.
2:02:46
But you know, if, if it, unless it's like a game that really grabs me, I'm not going to play enough to get that variation in it.
So like I, I like having them be short enough that I can feel the the randomness, the roguiness without having to play 50 hours to, to see that.
2:03:09
Oh, Andrew, you're muted.
No, I've made it so many episodes without doing that, Evan said.
Betsy.
Well, such is life.
I got a loud keyboard over here and a couple of loud cats.
Trying to play it safe, so I'm trying to remember correctly.
2:03:25
Is Will's perfect run number is, is it 90 minutes?
Yeah, 90 minutes.
I think that's, I think that is pretty good, a pretty good rule of thumb kinda to to start with and then you can maybe go up a little bit, maybe go down a little bit.
For me personally.
2:03:43
Yeah, it's that's that's a great point they're bringing up, Colin, that the it's it's if if it is super long that you're not gonna be able to enjoy that meaningful randomness that is so important to me in a row of like experience.
So yeah, come.
Andrew, how long I think you've played the most last spell of us?
2:04:01
How long is a single city in last spell?
Oh boy.
Well, let me tell you.
So the DLC's up and I've been playing that and yeah, it's it's still very long.
I'm trying to remember.
I wanna say like 3 or like threeish hours maybe.
2:04:21
Yeah.
And I play with, I have like the turbo mode set to like only like double and I don't have it on all the time.
So maybe I'm not like, you know, the average player, I feel.
Like that was that was my, my peak of like this is about as long as I want for something that feels like you're supposed to do it over and over and over again.
2:04:44
Totally, totally for sure.
And to be fair to that game, there's there's maybe not as much randomized content to be to be experienced.
So perhaps that specifically is not definitely, but we've discussed it at length during.
The show.
I mean, I, I picked that one because that's one of the I, I was just looking at the games in my top ten.
2:05:04
Oh, got you.
It's my #9 and I think that's the one with the longest run outside of Rimworld, which doesn't really count.
Rimworld is one of those games that's in the 12 plus hour and it's like I have experienced as a rogue leg because I've put in hundreds of hours but you 2 probably have not really experienced it as a rogue like in the.
2:05:26
Yeah, there's like there's an interesting element of like how long is too long?
Like what's my attention span kind of length where you know, if I, if I feel like with Rogue like games in general, there's you're you're beginning, middle and end of a run.
2:05:43
And like, if you're, if you're spending like a whole week and you haven't really experienced the end game like that much and you're expected to do this like over and over, like you better, you better like that game, right.
And for the record, like I, I enjoyed my time with the, with the last spell.
2:06:00
I thought it was just like maybe too much of a good thing where it was like, you know, if these rounds were like half as long, I feel like I would enjoy it twice as much because I'd be able to get to experience it like quicker one, you know, I guess 1 positive or a good thing to say about like monster train with like it's turbo mode where it's just like it's so, so like comedically fast.
2:06:22
Whereas it's like all the monsters just like this like blur of, of mutilation that goes on the screen.
But it's great because like, oh, I can do like a whole run of that in like an afternoon and be like, all right, Yep, I, I know exactly what I'm getting into and what I expect for the end game next time I play it.
2:06:42
Whereas like if I've only ever experienced like the mid game once for something like I don't really know what's around the corner and I have to invest a lot of time to get to that point.
So some even something like Tales of Mageo, I think like case of caves of Cut is also particularly bad at this is like these these games that were like their scope is so big, but like, yeah, like it's it.
2:07:05
We're literally just talking about like an RPG at that point and.
You know, find out next time when we do Kids in the Cud.
Probably next time.
Probably not actual next time, but someday.
Stay tuned.
Next time soon.
Yeah, Soonish.
Next week.
Two weeks.
But yeah, I think that'll that'll wind up our listener letter segment for our summer music fest.
2:07:27
So thanks for writing in folks.
But yeah, as as we kind of alluded just now, but also earlier in the show, our next episode will be a double feature for our big 50th game that we've been, that we've reviewed so far.
2:07:45
We're, you know, covering Doom, the rogue leg and it's modern remastered Jupiter hell.
SO2 the I I I was always surprised to find out how how popular Doom RL was with with such a huge variety of people.
2:08:04
So I'm I'm super excited to cover that one and particularly with like it being remastered with like actual graphics and stuff by the same developer.
So be a great conversation.
Tune in for that next time.
Yeah, we'll see you then.
