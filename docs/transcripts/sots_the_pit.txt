greetings all and Happy soft smoke

you're listening to another episode of the well the Grog pod meaning the going rogue gaming podcast a podcast about roguelikes and grog potting uh I am uh your your host uh Sergeant gunny Scott Berger and like always I'm joined with my Rogues gallery of co-hosts I'm your Scion Will Wright and I am uh weird some sort of space dolphin uh Colin Smith today we are talking about uh space dolphins in the the roguelike game sword of the Stars the pit developed and published by Kerberos Productions released February 21st 2013 for Windows Mac with an asterisk associated with it because I'm not sure if it's actually fully supported on that anymore and I'm just gonna assume it's supported on Linux because that's what it says on the store Page uh this game pulls in at at pretty well I guess I don't know pretty high for the five 5500 games in the roguelike database that we have now because I just refreshed it a couple days ago pulls in at a screaming 326 on the most popular Spectrum with 1 000 yeah like believe again I think it's because recency bias and there's just like an insane velocity of shovelware like like blasting onto steam every day that like almost all roguelikes ever released on Steam have been released and I don't know maybe like the past like year maybe 18 months um which would track and with this game being you know a 2013 kind of almost we're coming close to 10 years on it now amazingly yeah um having it be still in like the top so this one comes into the 326th most reviewed roguelike with 1455 total reviews clocking in unsurprisingly The 91st percentile of of all reviewed uh roguelike games on Steam um yeah like that it doesn't shock me that this one has kind of sat well we say that like it's at the top but that 300 layer I guess I could look up and see what what some of its contemporaries are but like that's that's funny because I would say that it's not at the top I'd say that it's actually in the pit which as his namesake I mean okay so let let's start off with I didn't really like this game but I can see I I read through a bunch of the reviews on Steam and a lot of them are from like 2013 to 2015 and they're talking about how like this is a well-polished version of the like ASCII style roguelikes and so if that's what you're comparing it against if it's like this is one of the first roguelikes with true graphics and sound and like voice acting and stuff on Steam like that's going to influence like they're comparing it to different games than we are uh and it is there's some fun flavor in in it so I could see people and people seem to get really really into the like the like mechanics of the runs and like this is probably this is probably our rogiest roguelike we've played since dreadmore yeah yeah I would say for sure this this is definitely the the traditional roguelike end of the spectrum despite the fact that it has Graphics uh but it's it's that turn-based grid-based procedural level generation permadeath Dungeon Crawler that that we kind of expect to to encounter with something that's called specifically like a traditional roguelike I think like as as we do more games we'll come to see that this uh like what is a roguelike that'll that will be a kind of corrupted term but uh yeah I think like well okay so let's let's back up a bit Colin one sentence what is what does one do in Sword of the stars of the pit uh shoot weird mutated space rats

it didn't even need a full sentence there you're trying to get to the bottom of an alien pit and you fight

science fictiony type stuff and you're Scavenging off of the materials in this lab pit thing

that's one of the things that that kind of jumps out to me is like the title to this game is a little confusing at first I thought okay this is just going to be some like big excavation pit or like a mining pit or like a Mortal Kombat pit like pit has like a very kind of specific uh evocative picture in my mind but in this game like you're you're you're dungeon diving right you're dungeon diving through an alien lab uh but I don't know if like sword of the Stars alien lab has a has a better ring to it

I mean I do like the name the pit that it feels fun to say uh uh deeply not what that felt like I feel like Pitt implies digging through ground and this was a hundred percent labs and mechanisms and stuff so pits you excavate Labs you don't labs are not a pit you don't have a bunch of science equipment computers and that kind of stuff in a pit yeah and well I guess maybe maybe to be fair like the the very first uh like descending thing that you do in this game I guess you technically kind of go into a pit maybe that's like the titular pit of the game's namesake but uh but yeah I think like so this game this game starts you out sword of the stars is a it's an extended universe that kind of has existed already with I think some 4X games that this developer had released ages ago um and so it like this game fits in in that kind of universe For Better or Worse where I think the like the abilities and the alien characters and stuff are all kind of sort of inherited from that previous game as far as I can tell I haven't really done much research onto that that previous game of theirs um but you're talking about like all the different races and all the different like sort of like classes and things because I noticed there's there's a ton of different like characters you can play as there's so much content around yeah mechanics in my opinion well so we were playing the I I mean Scott do we have all of the yeah I had I don't know what button I accidentally hit uh in the steam store but I think I accidentally got like the definitive edition that includes uh everything so normally the base game came with only three playable characters yes exactly not the 12 that we had access to yeah and those those three your kind of like Cookie Cutter uh standard archetypes of like um you have like a marine who's your you know big beefy like attack like low brain he's your Warrior Warrior kind of person yeah exactly cleric the medic actually I don't know what are the other two well well the medic was one of the expansion ones the other two uh there's a female Scout class and there's the engineer class and I'm I'm using my my mental powers of prediction here to Guess that Colin as our engineer on staff was legally obligated to play the engineer class no I played the uh psionic space dolphin oh which I I mean that'll get into some of my annoyance I I after I finished my run I went back and I looked through the wiki a bunch trying to figure out like what was I supposed to have been doing different here uh because uh spoiler to the end of my first run I starved to death

like I literally actually you know what that's I could not find I could not find more food and I and I just I start I was like starving and when you start starving everything all your stats go down and eventually I just I like I I think I technically died of poison but I was like it deeply modified how I was playing because I was like I need to just run as fast as I can to try and like open random boxes and stuff and uh it turns out the dolphin uses more food or something so that might have been like a somewhat atypical uh I I that might have been like part of playing that class is is that uh you need to like pry first food stock more but I don't feel like I could have looked for food better um so well the thing yeah that's that's one of the kind of intrinsic things about this game is that it's meant to have many playthroughs where you're slowly learning recipes and only through learning those recipes do you know how to combine uh meat with bread to make a sandwich for instance or something like that I didn't find a single recipe well yeah that's good because yeah in order to get the recipes you have to dump all your points into like the hacking for computers so if you want to if you want to have the meta progression happen you have to like basically turn all of your stats away from the combat uh uh focus and all the like kind of like things that help you out into the things that progress the game and so that's kind of like what is in my opinion a fundamental flaw with this kind of game yeah as opposed to like running around and picking up a recipe that says hey you you figured out how to make a sandwich congrats right and it was funny like because I was so pissed off by this mechanic I actually pulled up like hey what's up I have all this stuff on me what can I make with it I want to be I need food because I think like Colin like I needed food at one point I think it was my my Marine first run or second run or something I think I did like four or five runs in the like almost like four and a half hours that I played the game but like yeah food was a problem I'm like I have the ingredients here to make delicious food why can't I and then you put them into the thing that cooks and it's just like I'm sorry you don't you that's a valid recipe but you're you can't do that we are blocking you from that I'm like wait you can't wait you can't do it literally cannot unless you have learned the recipe which means that you've gone through the hacking [ __ ] computer process and it's just that's I I just assumed I mean I didn't cook a single thing the whole time I played because I knew the one recipe that you got from the tutorial and I never found a loaf of bread I I turned raw meat into cooked meat and that was the most basic thing and I did that and that was all that I had and so uh yeah yeah if you came across a bunch of robots in a row it's just like okay those robots [ __ ] you up and you get no food and you just kind of like you're done yeah I think one of the things this game does does pretty well other than like some like head scratching mechanics that I think like maybe at the time people hadn't quite figured out yet uh is I don't know accessibility maybe and I say that in two in two sort of ways I say that one because I have to call out any game that has like a reasonably decent tutorial like this game and that's the best feature in my opinion and the voice acting for that tutorial is which is kind of a double-edged sword because I was expecting more of that like I was expecting like you know the the like the voice actor sounded like he was kind of having fun in the in the uh the tutorial part uh there's like another person that you're talking with oh like I'm gonna be talking with like some kind of a team or something and it's gonna be like I think we had the impression that there would be some like maybe more of an element of like Starship Troopers Zenith going on uh that never really manifested itself particularly when people are calling you ape in the tutorial big I think a big plus that's why we chose this game yeah exactly yeah I assumed that there was going to be more allies in it because they I mean especially because they give you an ally in the uh in that tutorial and yeah you I mean I didn't encounter an ally and I had none it's definitely not like a core mechanic of the game um it's just you fighting fighting stuff robots robots a lot of robots but also wear rats or something whatever diseased goo wraps I think the the other side of the accessibility bit uh that I want to touch on a little is I think like the the art and like just like graphical design of this game is actually like pretty good and I would say like it's it reminded me a lot of dreadmore when I was playing it dungeon's a dreadmore a previous episode uh yeah in the sense that like there's lots of monsters they all look kind of different they're all uh like you know have have like a very sort of interesting cartoony element to them which is all you know kind of a little eye-catching Maybe a little I don't know like on I'm conflicted because I want to say that the character design is maybe a little Bland too because I couldn't really like there wasn't really anything like hooking me per se um but you know so you start this game you have options of like tutorial and looking through uh like stuff that you've unlocked and you know you start this game on kind of like a snowy surface just to kind of get your bearings and there's a a text scroll about how there's some disease that's broken out you gotta go 30 floors through this dungeon to the bottom to you know find the Cure that will that will you know destroy all the all the poison and stuff but you know everything in this alien lab is going to kill you um I think like a good enough a good enough hook to start um but as I was kind of like you know running through the halls of like the first few floors of this game like okay I can clearly see what's happening uh not a big fan of door traps which I think we'll get to in a minute yeah uh but like you know like okay this is here's here's my gun equip gun use gun on man like relatively straightforward stuff um and again like another sort of you know accessibility plus I was able to actually get this running on the steam deck at some point it did require a lot of tinkering to do and I don't blame the Developers for like not really caring to put in the effort to make it work um but I think this game like played really well in this game deck because like I would just sit there and you know just like watching the news and like okay I'm gonna you know run another floor of this thing and try to use like mind powers and just like you know not really put too much thought into it um and that's like maybe where it kind of peaked for me and didn't really go much higher than that

yeah no it did not go much higher than that at all I mean like I got 20. I didn't realize it's out of 30 floors I got like 20 the low 20s out of the 30 on normal so I felt like okay I'm getting The Full Experience here I didn't know what the public you know I didn't was happening other than like I'm going to put more points into the rifle because the assault rifle that was the weapon that like you could shoot you basically engage more Targets in one setting which became very important later on like early on melee is great yeah you just stab things and you just like save all your ammo but like um yeah I don't think there was much more than like once you get the feel of it and the first few uh uh floors it's like it's just more of that and like you slowly have upgrades but they're like yeah you pretty much always you're like oh I'm gonna upgrade the thing that I'm good at to get to like there's that's my dumb step my my rifle I need to get better at that you kind of have like your rifle thing and then like it's kind of just broad categories like choose a weapon specialize in that and then choose a kind of like a lock pick thing which is like computers or hacking or actual lock picks or whatever and then there's like the auxiliary sort of craft thing that you can do too and so it's like you you try and maximize these three things and you choose one of those like of the many I think there's like 30 or 40 different skill options yeah there's a crazy amount yeah and this is like I I as someone new to the game it's just like that's too much right out of the gate so um yeah I feel like I played a different game than you because I started with the psionic dolphin yeah I put no stats in anything except for psionic Powers I was just like running around mind blasting things and I was shooting them with my weird dart gun but it I feel like it was kind of like a it I I liked the the skill tree for psionics felt pretty good I wish there was like one or two more damage dealing things um but I thought it ran it was a pretty good I feel like so often games are like here's 100 skills uh and this had it had a lot of skills but it was a manageable a lot and they had pretty pretty good situational use so didn't I didn't feel like I so I I feel like a lot of games um what was the one that we played that was the use like the Diablo style one's curse yeah that's the one which is basically like what's the difference between the fire tree and the ice tree it's like well one does fire and the other is icy like well I mean that was a fun game but like there's no oh let's not get carried away there's no differentiation between it because like each of these like there's a seven psionic skill trees and each one had a pretty different mechanism for how you're doing stuff so you could like impose Madness upon them uh like the bionic like any living would like go crazy and kill stuff nearby you could buff yourself you could shoot a psychic fisted stuff I I so I I thought that was a it had a better design than I was expecting and I I thought it was pretty good so yeah and I and I like played around with a little bit of those maybe a little too late in my run because I was just I was dump stat dumping into like hacking stuff I was doing the Scout and I was I was um I was Scout pistoling running around and just like trying to be fast I was trying to use my cogmine strategy of like just outrun everybody and like that seemed to work pretty well um but I was like oh yeah there's like this whole psionics thing that I'm not even like touching on at all and I was a little bummed that like the uh I unlocked I think accidentally a couple of those psionic abilities by picking up like I don't look like a little like uh like pink sea urchin item that you eat and the descriptions I think for some of these items are pretty funny and were like this is something that like you eat and then it like goes up your navel nasal cavity and like wraps around your brain stem and lets you like unlock the ability that way fun little flavor text but like that gave me uh there was one ability that allowed me to like sense enemies through walls which was the life sense was very useful yeah there was on all the time yeah and there was another one that was like psionic defense that I thought was less useful but I was like well what else is in this train there's like just straight up like an invisibility one like oh I want that give me that but in order to do so I would have to dump I don't know 10 15 levels worth of points into this thing as far as I understand it to unlock it I'm like oh but then I'm gonna like miss out on leveling up all sorts of other stuff and it doesn't feel like a fun uh trade-off in that sense yeah I think if you're gonna do the psychic stuff you basically but you would have to go all in right you just pick a different character to start with I just started with invisibility it's fine it's not that good yeah you don't want to start as a marine and then Tech into psionics yeah um to highbrow but I feel like I think my biggest problem with this game was that the choices didn't feel they either didn't feel meaningful or they didn't feel like they were actually choices that I could make like so I was like my dolphin boy was starving to death and it wasn't that I could choose to risk more danger to get more food I just like I I was just going through like maybe it's because I'm not doing the game right maybe it's because I didn't have the recipes unlocked but I was just unable to make a choice to do more danger to mitigate this thing like I wanted to be able to trade safety for food I could not do so and it's the same with like all the crafting things it's like I want to be able to I have like a bunch of stuff in my inventory that I I can't do anything with oh yeah is there and so it's like I'm not the the trade-off I'm making is hold this thing for something maybe in the future that I don't know about or drop it for some other thing but I also don't know what I might use it for in the future uh and like that's anti-fun extremely like and FTL had the same problem too like if you're just like even thinking about like a simple mechanic of fuel for your ship like fuel was like kind of food like what you're talking about here where like yeah you could like try and like have an excess Supply at all points of time but like if you were just doing the normal thing like the kind of the optimum amount there's some probability that you just don't encounter like through all the Random Encounters because it is perfectly like not perfectly but like it's very random like you just might not encounter fuel for a while and so like hey for you know in certain a certain percent of your runs ten percent of your runs to make up a number like you just simply are not gonna encounter food for a stretch that will kill the player that is like getting the normal amount that is trying to aim for the normal amount of food to have it right but in FTL like you didn't have Statin deficits if you ran out of fuel you were just kind of stranded there and well that just that's a major sad deficit when all that happens is like somebody comes along to try and kill you and maybe you can kill it and take the few like the three fuel out of it the fuel you're like or sometimes you get Super Lucky but like that's it's a Sim it's a similar mechanic where it's just like not a fun mechanic in my view because it kills runs like there's at all points in time just to have a death happen to your run for completely seemingly something that you can't really affect aside from to to boost up your your base level of of food or or or fuel which on average is worse so I've heard this phrase recently definitely in the post 2013 era but they the idea that health is a resource um and I like that way of thinking about board games or video games in general and I want the ability to spend my that resource and I was unable to do so like trade health for like some other healthless risk yeah yeah trades to health trade safety there was not a don't open this room it's really hard inside but if you do you get like really good stuff in it every room felt I mean part part of my Christmas in the game was it it did feel a little bit samey all of the rooms were like they had the theme like would be like oh it's a medical room or this but they didn't really feel that different from one another I didn't I didn't ever really feel like I like oh I shouldn't open this door yeah because there might be a monster zoo on the other side or something right so monster Zoo right like trying to make it you're trying to make the decisions and it's you're just kind of running around and I'm sure that that's somewhat due to inexperience with the game like I bet you that there are I I would assume that a more Optical strategy in the way I played would be to run around figure out where the exit is and then more carefully backtrack through and look at stuff but like I don't like playing games like that yeah I'm a completionist I want to look in every room and breaking that habit for me you need to have a a hard hook to do it the other way yeah there didn't seem to be a really compelling reason why you would want to stay on each floor except for like maybe XP grinding because it was like okay I found I found the floor exit like the goal of the game is to get to the bottom of the pit and like figure out the mystery and get the ending down there like why am I what am I sticking around here for uh I feel like other games like um even with like din's curse for example like there might be a mission objective on that floor for you to like go and go explore go find that thing to like do something and you have in or at least in din's curse anyway you have like a a town portal teleporter that takes you kind of back to your home base to kind of like regroup and reset uh get your bearings again um even even like you know dreadmore you know you could you have the ability to like go down to a floor and then come back up to the floor that you were previously on and kind of like save space it there a little bit um and even dreadmore had like you know more I think like hey dreadmore had like enormous floor levels um but dreadmore also had uh I guess more more stuff to do in each one of them um I think the pit had there was some stuff that was interesting that I wanted like more explanation of like there were some some rooms that I encountered and I was playing on like new bass easy difficulty mode because uh you know I'm I'm just in it to see what's there like I'm not trying to you know die 100 times be like you know the hardcore completion is but like I was coming across like computer rooms that had like little little like story lower bits in there but again it's sort of like shooting itself in its own foot for no reason you go up to the computer terminal a you would need a thing to hack it B you would need to pass the hack check C like if you have uh there's like some other skill set that was like being able to decipher first stuff yeah and like the the like you get you get a message that's like oh here's like a lower down or like something interesting um but like unless you can decipher like a good chunk of it it's effectively useless and then even then like some of those messages are a mix of like be sure to eat you know drink your Ovaltine kind of things or stuff that's more of like you know hey I'm the character that's at the end of the game like I'm leaving messages for you you should like here's like cool stuff like I want more of that give me more of that but it's just like it's like the game is going out of its way not to give you it but again like this might be a hindsight sort of thing like well people back in 2013 didn't know any better um those poor fools 2013. they had no idea uh-huh so what's interesting about the pit is October 22nd 2021 I guess I don't know is that relatively recently uh the pit two came out in Early Access and judging by judging by Will's face this is not of disgust a strong look of this guy now I want to look that up I mean I I went so like I knew that like the pitu was was being released gosh what was yeah like some some time ago and my thought process was okay maybe they will have taken some of the learnings from this plus like you know almost like a decade's worth of like roguelike development and you know Lessons Learned and things like that um and and put it into that second one but I'm I'm maybe like the last person to judge a book by its cover but I don't know that that store Page is really doing itself any favors of moving moving to a a 3D environment which oh my God I'm looking at it right now and I would rather play their stylized cartoon 2013 version than this this looks bad is it like the risk of rain update I mean like the the risk of rain risk of rain looks good yeah

yeah oh you know like something like goat simulator now that's a game yeah but imagine you were playing the pit but it was Goat Simulator Graphics it looks like no I'm gonna say no to that one yeah it I mean the the graphics are just not well served here yeah I I don't know like you're you're you don't need a you don't need that much uh production value to uh or not production value but it's it's easier to make a 2d thing that looks good and has like a stylized look to it yeah uh this has somehow made everything even more generic and that's definitely not the way that I needed this game to go selling point yeah can I can I like I just I want to talk if I can for a moment about like a game component that I think has been more or less standardized in the modern era which is this idea of uh uh you have in an intense period where you're doing hard things you're clicking quickly or you know and then you have the town essentially and I think uh just as a game top of my off top of my head like a Diablos sort of thing where you're out there you're fighting and then like and you're you're collecting all this stuff and then you're overloaded you're hurt whatever you go back you breathe you upgrade you do all your skill stuff you make sure you're ready to go again and then you go back out and there's this that that kind of loop where you're you're that's uh it provides the player with a uh sort of a play texture if you can imagine playing a game as a texture where it's like it's not just one texture all the way throughout it's like this thing then this thing then this thing whereas so so the the I think if I had the I don't know if I'm gonna summarize this as like the number one like problem with this game but like the thing that we've been talking about here is that like every floor feels like this every room feels like the same room like the the gameplay did not do a very good job of giving you the texture the here's a segment here's another segment it's a shorter segment and it has a different flavor and then there's another like I want to have a seven course meal of a game instead of like one I'm I'm a hog at a I'm just stuffing my face into this uh uh uh what's the with the troubles yeah exactly troubles yeah yeah a tropo truffles and uh that's that's this game is I am just stuffing my head in that trough and uh but even something like slay the Spire for example doesn't doesn't have and doesn't need like a a home base or a town sort of thing but it has a difference between the combats right yeah combat after combat after comment they're alternating uh what your experience is uh you get to choose too right you should probably move Cog mind up further on our list of games we should play because I know Scott and I both like it and I feel like it is by a large margin the most or the again that's an actual roguelike that I've played the most and liked because I feel so much the need to compare this to Cog mind which I played it yeah I'm happy to make those compared I mean I guess maybe not I don't have nearly anymore well so I feel like we should play it so that we uh we should talk about it on the podcast so that we the comparisons make more sense for later games but yeah even in COG mine which is a very much a like ASCII Style turn-based roguelike game with science fiction like science theme stuff it's like it's a Sci-Fi thing like this game but you have meaningful choices that you can make in that game and you do end up in like weird Town areas yeah you get times where it is you get that different texture and you're going up against enemies like there are absolute differences in how you should respond to certain enemies I know the answer to this is a is a hard no from will but Colin have you played Tales of magial before uh oh that's installed right now I have that icon on like it's there I think probably just in preparation for a future podcast but yeah I think like so in in the hopper that we have for traditional roguelikes like like these games uh coming through hey kogmas 10 on Steam like uh Tome is is quite possibly the ugliest and most fun game that I've I've ever played um but it does like that's another example of a game that has like you know oh actually bits Tome is the acronym for Tales of magical yes uh well it has a a very uh almost in Tome length history to it whereas originally Tales of Middle Earth and then licensing and copyright blah blah anyway it is like games like games like that have that kind of uh narrative breakup and flow that you're talking about where hey you have like you know there's risk and reward there's like this thing that you're going and seeing and like breaking up that kind of um action to it where the pit you know is is fine you know it has a a good artistic aesthetic you're running around through basically copy pasted uh hallways um and going into like small rooms to see what's in there and it's always filled with monsters maybe there's some you know um ammo crate or supplies and stuff you can kind of refuel your way uh along in your quest but like where where's like the safe space for you to hide away from like all the monsters where's like your um your ability to escape from danger whereas your your lore drops all that kind of stuff um that you know oh I'm looking through like some of the some of the games on this list when they were released like 2015 2017 2017 2014 2020. like these are all games that have like figured that out and like what my hope would be for the pit too graphical style aside because I know like I think risk of rain is maybe like the only game that I know of that has successfully pulled off a 2d to 3D transition uh with a small team specifically in this kind of genre um uh fallout you know in this genre oh right right okay with that I feel like they're they're ones that did it successfully but it was like we invented 3D Graphics maybe slightly different Studio sizes but like if the pit 2 was was like okay give me more of that kind of cartoony style I think that style works but build off on like some of those more um well polished and well trodden uh gameplay mechanics and like game design styles that we've seen be successful I think that would go a lot like that would go way further than just saying hey here's the 3D version of the game that you didn't like before yeah well and especially I think something a game like this you don't gain anything from being in three dimensions yeah like a first person shooter can't really exist in two Dimensions like you gain or or like you know the the classic 2D to 3D is Mario like Mario going to wait what what never heard of it like is that a roguelike yeah the Rogue like Mario Mario uh I mean like Mario 64 versus Super Mario like

you changed the way that the game is played because you have added a third dimension I don't think that this kind of game really has a third dimension to it it doesn't need them but like like and I can think of games that are in 3D that are the same kind of so XCOM is that was exactly it's a 3D game but like you could pretty much play x-com with a top-down cartoon Graphics thing and it wouldn't change the gameplay pretty much at all uh you would have to like add some things for like changing Z layers or something yeah you could do it you could probably play x-com like the modern XCOM unlike a Super Nintendo it could have been a Game Boy game I think yeah like I'm sure that there's stuff in there that's not it would be a little bit hard to get on there but there are definitely certain games that uh we've gotten better at making the game but I mean I I I'm you know I know that I've talked with Will about this before slay the Spire which is like Will's favorite game like no that's one of five I don't care what you say it's your favorite game there are five ten or ten games that exist in the world that's mine being the other eight I forgot about uh is is pretty good um anyway uh you could have made slay the Spire for a Game Boy you could have made it probably for like an original Nintendo there's nothing in it that wasn't available then we just got better at making games uh

and so like I'm looking at a game like this where it came out in 2012. it could have come out in 1995 it could have been like one of those old roguelike games like the ASCII style Graphics there's nothing that like you've got pinball you've got Solitaire and you've got uh yeah like there's nothing in the game that requires graphics or really Aesthetics of any kind like I guess it might be hard for like the menu system but you we've I guess we just got better at making games in general uh one thing that I have seen from the raw data set also is that like the the quote unquote good games in in like the road like genre like uh come out in big waves every so many years and by what I mean by that is like you have you have a like a a fundamental pillar game like an FTL or a Spelunky or um oh my God we just talked about it uh Binding of Isaac like those kinds of like major games that come out and people like oh my God this is amazing like I want to make a game and they become inspired but like the development process to make video games is really hard and really long and by the time that the good ones have come out since then like it's been at least like two or three years since that original like major splash of a game came out and so you see this in the data set of things like you know oh here's um a game like you know this is a you know a bad example but like Binding of Isaac comes out and then people like oh my God this is amazing and then you have this big wave of uh twin stick roguelike shooters that come out that are really good like three years down the line and something like this like the pit I feel like is in a a kind of pit uh where it has uh not really had that kind of like um breakthrough inspiration really to kind of like Propel its game development maybe is that fair to say like drink more dreadmore I would say is like like pretty good like funny uh interesting uh I feel like if you haven't played a game like that before dreadmore is worth your time um there were no envelopes pushed with the pit yeah um it is

it did not break new ground it is 100 vanilla I'm pretty sure which I'm surprising because there's like a lot of stuff in it it feels there's too much content for it to be only vanilla there's like it it's it's that thing that happens where adding more things doesn't actually make it less Bland it just kind of like mixes all the flavor together until there's no flavor yeah you need you need like the part of your ice cream cone with the sprinkles you need the part of your ice cream cone with like the big caramel chunk right you need like the areas that like you know you can add more stuff like that but they need to be the game needs to be chunkified a little bit I think is what we're getting at you know what it is it's it's uh whatever you call this drink the the one where you get all of the sodas from the soda machine I mean I grew up calling it graveyard I think that's what we call the here but I know people in the east coast call it something different doesn't matter what sodas are on that machine it always tastes just like weirdly vague like sugary sugar carbonated water yeah yeah it just like it tastes Bland somehow despite the fact that you had like five or ten different like strongly different sodas like by the end it's it's just one weird flavor whereas if you had you know just focused on a couple of flavors here and there and just drank those it'd be delicious there's there's a framework out there that it's used in business and I hate to I really do hate to bring in like business strategy things but this just is standing out uh which is this idea of the blue emission strategy and there's this diagram which is like um uh you uh eliminate create uh reduce and uh was the last one uh was it ERC so eliminate you reduce creates uh one of the doesn't matter what I'm saying here is that the point is that like this game doesn't like create anything it doesn't like do it it doesn't follow this process where it's creating something that's unique which is like that's kind of the purpose of this the Blue Ocean strategy is to like find something that is new and fresh and in order to do that you have to like take all of the roguelike games you eliminate something all all together you create something new you um uh you reduce something that other people like oh you also you expand I don't remember the last raise eliminate reduce create is what what could be okay right right exactly and so that that framework I feel like would have helped the creators of this game and I think it kind of like speaks to like what we're all trying to say here which is that this game feels very Bland because it's just

I think it would be good if like if it broke so like the the developers Kerberos I think have have kind of like dug themselves into a sort of like a franchise corner of like a pit yeah but like they're in a pit because like they they released this game and they had a bunch of DLC to it and I think the DLC is interesting but like um you know they they have like there was like another pit game that they released there was some like some other stuff in the middle but like I feel like the sword of the Stars franchise that they have going like just like do something new like I think like they are they're competent developers I think like they know like how to make a game but like I don't think that this game is really like elevated by it being in that same kind of universe yeah and I looked up after you mentioned I looked up that yeah they have the Forex game and it's like oh yeah a Forex game it makes sense to have like all these different species that have different things in a in a rope like that just isn't like variety and like you know building multiple units and ships and yeah I mean they have a uh a the pit board game that they released in 2018 oh no that's

I mean I don't like you see where I'm going with this like it I don't think like them investing more into the pit uh like franchise is really a money pit yeah uh like if they if they did some like new new uh Universe it could still be sci-fi and I thought that like you know the cartoony kind of hand-drawn Graphics worked but like you know trunkify it a little bit make like here's here's like this room with a lower drop here's like different branching paths you can take throughout you know the uh the the gameplay Loop that kind of thing things that I think people have have kind of figured out about roguelikes yeah like thrown a monster zoo or in in there too like and not have the monster Zoo this is something I really kind of irritated me like the the second like you go to a new floor there's like five enemies like right there right in front of you yes immediately every time you got on that floor you're just surrounded and like my build was not meant for being surrounded so I just that was like a hard thing for every floor yeah you can't strategize because you appear and people talk about this game like being being like unfairly hard and I don't think that that's a selling point like I'm fine with like games being like we just talked about FTL like that game is brutally hard but I feel like bad game is fair enough in its hardness yeah that like it at least like you know gives you an option to say like oh [ __ ] this enemy ship is gonna like you know Blast Me The Smithereens I'm just gonna like pack up my guns and just boost out of here like you have no option in the pit like you're running out of ammo constantly you have to worry about a hunger timer like they're like these are things that I think people have kind of figured out that I'm I'm crossing my fingers that maybe they will address in the pit too but I'm I'm not really holding that breath at this point so I'm gonna contrast it against something like the Dark Souls where Dark Souls brutally hard but you can get good and be amazing at dark souls and you can like uh what you can run around and uh no hit kill the the last boss of Ellen ring well yeah you're leveling up your like your your uh dexterity skill to do the you know exact sequences you're learning kind of that but like they don't there's not that mechanic mechanic in this game and I don't know but you could train your mind like you are a better slay the Spire player than me because you have trained your mind to be better at it there's certain things in this game are just like you can't train your mind to be better at maybe monsters not appear when you go down to the next level like that's not a choice it's not a it's not a skill it's not a strategy I guess the strategy is knowing that that's true and having Health always go down but being fully loaded when you go down yeah that's pretty much the strategy like a fun that's not a fun strategy like I don't feel like I've exercised My Mind by figuring that strategy out it's not an into the breach sort of like oh and so you're gonna appear here and so therefore I'm going to do this move to go cast me over here but that's only so that this thing can hit like that's the thing that for a tactics game or what's on the surface looks like a it's you know it's a every moment is like I think there's what the two moments per like sort of like gameplay like yeah thing that you can do and like yeah the tactic is you you attack and you can't run away and running away is just not an option there's no like oh I need to like get cover and like I mean like oh only to this most minor degree versus other games which are very much very much more based on like an actual strategy and tactics it's like the user grenade that's your big good question do I use my Scion thing here and it's just like it's not a very fun decision to make yeah and like you can't you know hide around a corner and wait till they run around because they like don't seem to follow you that much like I was trying to like bait the robots to like come after me so that I could hit them before they hit me just never really worked yeah lay a trap lay a mine like Retreats nope that's not really a thing yeah they don't come after you quite vigorously enough like the the little the little baby enemies do like the little brats and the bats and whatnot because they're too smart they see through your tactics sure but I don't care about them like like that's just like those are just ways to waste my ammo they don't really do a lot of damage things that do damage are things that I can't trick into doing anything except for trade blow over blow that's pretty much what it is right you just sit there you're like okay I have made sure to reload before this engagement and now we're gonna like do this thing where it's just like out out out back and forth and then I'll win yeah I don't know is Scott did you do you do it looks like I'm not sure do you agree with that is there more strategy that was basically my strategy and this is where I think that like if if like those psionic abilities which I thought were cool and interesting if those were more accessible and like easier to unlock like oh like every level that you you level up you get one of those for free and you get to pick one like that would be cool and then it would help like with that kind of experimentation I feel like that's like the thing that the game like does differently than other stuff in a very like dreadmory style fashion of like oh here's here's like these cool abilities that you can do in addition to like your standard attacking with like a bow or a gun or whatever but yeah like I was just I was just like you know standing like 10 10 tiles away from an enemy and like shoot with pistol move back shoot with pistol move back and like every so often I'd like open up a door and there'd be like you know three security droids in there or something lob a grenade shoot move back shoot move back and just like doing that whole thing over and over again where I'm like okay like this is this isn't really that entertaining uh and then I ran out of ammo and I'm like oh [ __ ] now what uh yeah they're hunting though yeah that's great yeah but because my character was like you know super wimpy and you know a hacker like you can't knife stuff very well I need like a computer knife or something and like it just yeah like descending down to the floor and then like okay now I'm surrounded by like Five Guys immediately I have no ammo I'm hungry and like okay now I'm diseased great what was like what was the or optimal play there other than just getting dunked on like and this was on easy like I don't you know I I get the draw of like playing on an insano mode but like it doesn't it's it's more like oh hooray I won by luck of the dice as opposed to my my tactical thinking and I'm sure like the the hundreds of you know uh pit stands are gonna listen to this and just pit stained pit stands uh they are pit stains yeah that sounds about right yeah or listening to this just like pulling their hair out while screaming down the freeway it's like no you idiots your life of course you're playing bad because of that but unless like like unless it's made obvious in like you know the four or five hours that we were playing it like there there's other games that we have on our list here that are just gonna do better right I think that's the big problem is it's like I'm sure that we could all have played this game much better we could have been better and we could get good and we could grind our way through finding all the recipes which probably helps a lot I'm sure I mean if this is the year 2000 then we would probably would have played this game incessantly because it would have been yeah it would have been great

it would have been better but I still how should I go yeah no I guess it's a different genre but like I'm trying to imagine like what did I play that oh yeah that was like the best game of all time back then it has to it has to be there has to be enough of a draw that I want to get good like if I'm not having fun then

then you're playing Dwarf Fortress or no I don't want to play I don't want to play this game more so that I can get good because I don't see the point of being like winning in this game is not intrinsically valuable to me there are other games that I could do I'm not getting money for it so I I need to have fun from the start I need to be hooked by it if I'm not having fun on the first playthrough I'm not having fun on the second playthrough becoming better requires me to you need to convince me that my fifth playthrough or my tenth playthrough will be fun and I've played games like that where I'm like yeah this was not great but like I can see the potential of where it would become good and I'm willing to push through that I mean something like the Crusader Kings or your universalis those like insane Forex games where you're just like uh or Dwarf Fortress like I'm we're playing drawer forces right now just came out and it's a grind to learn everything but it's like I want to because I can see how where we're going and you haven't convinced me in this game that there's some place that we're going that's going to be substantially better than where we are the 38th floor that way when we kill or do something there then there's a one line of text that says you win it's almost worse than that because like oh yeah do you know what the end looks like I've looked up a video because I'm like okay clearly I'm not invested enough to go to the end here but so I'm like okay what's what's the big payoff here uh you eventually find 30th floor you eventually find like this capsule that um like this this uh basically Frozen in uh Carbonite like naked woman is in and she's like I guess you know her genetic code is the thing that like we'll we'll cure all the poison or whatever it wasn't very descriptive but what was funny about it was and it's just like oh you found the naked lady in the chamber the end basically here's your score uh and like I was like okay yeah it's got a lame ending but huh oh sorry go ahead uh well so what was funny after that is like at the score sheet it has like your character posing in you know in like a very Victorious like kind of stance with like the naked like women sort of like behind you as like there's a smart trophy I've collected the trophy to win the game and the uh the Scout character the the woman Scout character that I was playing as in the games lore that's her sister so like at the end when you when you see like someone with a scout Victory it's like this you know this woman like very triumphantly posing like yes I did it I conquered you know and I got like this trophy babe who's like your sister in like a like a weird like naked crouching pose behind you

wait oh yeah again like not really not really gonna draw me in for the end here but uh but I I had a mighty chuckle at that at least that's incredible and you're telling me that was there a boss on the what the final floor or is like is this game completely bossless um I don't I don't recall seeing a boss but I was kind of skipping around a lot of this person's let's play uh I'm sure that like in a very sort of like Dread Maureen fashion that like you know the further down you go like basically every enemy becomes a boss at that point um yeah that's a I mean that's a whole other like thing to talk about is like that skill versus difficulty um I'm looking at some of the other stuff that Kerberos Productions made and so they made sort of the Stars the first one which is a 4X game and they made sort of the Stars two Lords of winter which is a sequel to that first one but it is a turn-based strategy real-time tactics game um and it got a IGN gave it a 2.5 out of 10. because it wasn't in a pit if it was in a pit their views are between 2.5 and 4 out of ten uh then they made this game which is a roguelike and they also I think is their biggest is their best success so far I think yeah uh and just like this is and I guess they're all over the place but it's fine if you're a studio going all over the place but these scams seem to have no true relationship to each other the like you don't need to have the same theme between them you don't need to pull the braces from your Forex game into your uh into your roguelike game or you're dungeon crawling like oh yes the tie-in the Lear the space Dolphins you remember them from the Forex games you can play right of course

well okay so let's let's move on to rankings uh I think I think we have kind of an idea where these games are going to fall um I'll go first I my average score so far has been like a six and a half for the games that that we've been rating and ranking so far and I think I'm gonna like I didn't dislike my time with sort of the Stars the pit but I feel like it there's nothing here to really like push me to kind of come back to it um so my my objective score rating for this I'm gonna give it a 6.6 that lands it just behind pineapple smash crew and just above din's curse um where I think like pineapple smash crew like you know you're blowing stuff up like there's you know the call to action there is a very simple just like hey you're a pineapple run in there smash stuff din's curse like uh I didn't really like it all but like it kind of It kind of hooked me the more I went through it um I think the pit like I like its art style I think you know the once I got it running on Steam deck it was it was pretty decent the tutorial you know I'll give it props for um but yeah like you know we just blasted it for an hour with with all of our critiques of it um fix all that stuff it'd be it'd be an eight out of ten easy just do that there I think there is a path to repairing this game like I I think it's got like a solid base they just need to like get that texture built by making more variety around the pacing and that kind of stuff so I mean I agree I agree with you there like it it has a solid base but uh you said you said your average score was what out of ten my average score so far has been a six and a half out of ten uh where Realm of the Mad God is kind of dragging that down by it as a sea anchor oh yeah no I'm looking at I'm seeing the same thing here I I'm actually it looks like my average here uh is 4.4 is my average uh I gave this one a 4.5 um solidly in the middle here and uh what is that that puts it just above um pineapple Smasher I put lower of course what no you're wrong yeah um we're wrong and then uh what we got here is the next one above that is uh rank three is dungeons of dread more so yeah it's basically equivalent to I I put more time in the dungeons of dreadmore and I think the reason is that like there's felt like there's a more call to action I knew I wanted the defeat dreadmore I mean like that I have a goal right exactly like that is what compelled me to play I probably played that game for like five times as many hours is that or four times as many hours something like that just because I did you go back to dreadmore at all after we did that episode yeah no I I wanted to beat it and like I didn't I didn't actually like I don't know we played right after that one but like I wasn't super into it so I'm just like yeah I'll just boot this up again and like and then I had to be like and then I was like on the forums I know a game is good when I'm in the wiki looking at like what is the meta strategy around like actually beating it because I just wanted to beat it and uh I think yeah I think I did once with some kind of like ridiculous strategy with some DLC content or whatever but like the point is here for this game it's uh yeah um it's a game and I don't recommend it's one of the games of all time yeah uh I wanna I'm gonna agree with you guys on the uh it I didn't like this game I gave it it's it's my number seven out of ten the seventh seventh worst out of ten uh right behind a valley without wind

so there we go yeah I know we talked about that beforehand but oh my goodness what that's the worst game I mean I'm pretty sure I'm the outlier in terms of where we're ranking things I have I have some pretty wide discrepancies between my ranks and your ranks uh but like it did feel like it had it had the skeleton of a of a game that I could like uh you give it like add some texture you know it's got them bones but you just gotta like get some eyeballs and some some weird meat on there and like flesh it out into something that's a little bit less generic um so like I could see it becoming or well it's not going to but I could have seen it becoming a game that was more enjoyable for me to play um versus something like a valley without wind which I liked more than this game but that felt like that was a game that had too much skeleton it's all skeleton yeah like yeah that's the kind of game where like you they did try and put too much stuff in there it's got like five skeletons all grafted together and you probably it's probably unfixable uh but no like this game could have been could have been good and it gives me this is the kind of stuff where like we haven't played a traditional Rogue like that I've truly enjoyed yet and I yeah and I've I've played Cog mine so I know that that is a a thing that can be had for me like I can enjoy a traditional roguelike I've done it and we'll we'll play it again on this podcast at some point um but like this has the bones of like oh I could see something similar to this being a game that I like uh

but it requires me too it requires

I don't know a lot of finesse to do it right uh I I think you really need to tune stuff and I think I'll and the procedural generation aspect of it uh leads itself to not bespoke uh things like that because you have to you have to balance for so many different possibilities yeah it's a stay tuned for sure but I think uh Jupiter hell which was released relatively recently 2021 I think uh that I think is is the sequel to this that we're all looking for so we'll have to get to play that one eventually indeed uh yeah so if you want to get in contact with the show grogpodzone gmail.com uh send us uh send us a mail about how we're so wrong about the pit and we will uh we'll read you into the pit uh if you if you are uh rightly abandoning Twitter and you want to find us on on Mastodon grogpod at gamedev.place is where you can find us there or on on the web at grogpod.zone um but before we go uh we have to give a preview for what our next episode will be and doing some roguelike roulette with um I have I found the dice wait are you literally I thought we all agreed a whole game well we did I have to do this for production value though

we got uh just rolling them dice there so of of our of our three games that uh that we could have selected uh fate the traitor sold uh Diablo Junior um black ice being a a very interesting FPS uh roguelike game uh very tronny um I think we all landed on invisible ink as our next episode is that right yeah I mean that's what I want I don't know the dice wanted for based on that role the dice figured out what three games we'd look at oh right

uh there is there is Randomness involved in this it's just Freedom we get to actually choose the 103. it's a SDS a card pick scenario yeah yeah I don't I don't know where my cards are packed and I don't know how to make a card uh riffle Shuffle sound effect but uh

but invisible that's what's up yeah yeah it's invisible for reference I rolled a a one a five a three and a three so I don't know if that's good or bad for invisible ink but we'll see those are d6s uh this is yes oh yeah Scott how much dude did you have to play before of all the d100s that I just rolled yeah yeah and I'll just say like this is a game that I just like happen to have like as I was just naturally interested in it I played through it and I uh I I'm I'm looking forward to next time because I'll get to go back and play some of the content that I didn't get to go through and it's uh actually a fun game I think yeah we got to pull well we got to pull that average ranking up this will help

all right everyone well thanks for listening and uh we'll see you next time for uh invisible
