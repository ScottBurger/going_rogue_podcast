Welcome, Children of the Fleece.
Raise your hands high and praise be to another episode of The Grog Pod where we take a minute we we look at Rogue like games here, big or small.
0:47
And you know, we we try to do our best divine inspiration of where those games land.
Among the ones that we've reviewed so far, I am your glorious and infallible leader, bringing serenity, love and loving serenity.
1:03
Scott Berger and with me are my podcast apostles.
This is Will your spider catching cultists in a web.
And I'm Colin.
I am your cannibal leader.
1:19
I will sacrifice you when you eat your flesh.
Today we are playing the political campaign and NBA venture capital simulator Cult of the Lamb, released August 11th, 2022.
This is a very ubiquitous game as basically all Devolver games are.
1:36
You can find it almost everywhere.
Steam, GOG, PlayStation of choice, Xbox of Xbox of choice, Nintendo of choice I guess maybe just on the Switch.
This was developed by Australian based Massive Monster, although I guess they have some satellite offices in like Singapore and elsewhere, which is which is interesting.
1:56
But I think they're mainly based in Australia with other previous notable games such as the Adventure Pals Never Give Up.
Well, I guarantee you've heard of this unicycle Giraffe I'm sure you've played.
2:13
And then there of course their cult hit Cult of the Lamb 20/22 it.
Wasn't a loop hero.
Or am I?
No, no, no.
Yeah, that loop hero is published.
By Devolver.
So this This was also published by Devolver, but developed by Massive Monster.
2:30
Separate studio.
But yeah, we have.
We've covered a good chunk of hey, Devolver has kind of put out a good a good number of Roadlight games.
We've already covered like a decent chunk of them.
See our previous episodes on Like you said, Loop Hero.
We just did enter the Gungein, so we're continuing our streak there, but still for sure.
2:49
Stay tuned with Inscription Downwell and Phantom Abyss to round out the the Devolver pantheon.
There Cult of the Lamb rolls in the mega church with the number 20th most, 20th most popular.
3:06
I'm speaking in tongues here.
I really, I really just can't be be contained. 20th most popular Rogue like is what the Google doc says with 52,477 total reviews.
I just, I get up on the stage in front of all all of You Beautiful people.
3:26
I just.
I lose my words.
Well, you've just been inducted into a cult, and you need to describe this game in one sentence in order to be spared.
Yeah, this is a sacrilegious combination of Hades, Binding of Isaac and Stardu Valley.
3:45
That's that's one sentence.
I'm actually containing it to one sentence this time, but I can expand on that.
If you want no podcast over, just hit the stop record button here.
I mean, I think that's pretty much it.
Good get, good pod, good pod.
MM HM, MM HM.
I mean, I feel like.
4:04
Overall, I mean that does capture the essence of it.
It pulls in a lot of mechanics from those three games and on top of it, it had it like, it kind of like puts them all into this really nice packaging of this this this the idea of the sacrificial land, the profits, the the you're getting a bunch of cultists.
4:21
And this narrative of like freeing this like Demigod or I don't know exactly what it was from, it's like it's prison.
And so you're you're the one that the kind of narrative is you.
You are the sacrificial land that can.
Release him and and so you get his powers when you're killed and he in order to bring you back to life and then you kill off essentially the four guys, the four gods keeping him imprisoned.
4:45
And yeah, the story is like this twin stick shooter essentially where it's like a melee shooter where you're doing kind of like the the balance of the the going into the what do they call it, the Crusades, kind of like these 8 to 15 minute little like combat sessions essentially with very Spire like in the way that the map is.
5:04
Laid out and that sort of a thing.
And then you come back to the town where you're building.
A.
A cult, essentially.
Like, you're capturing dudes out in the wild.
You're bringing them back, you're pulling into your cult.
You're, you know, keeping them all happy.
You're giving sermons and rituals and you're, you know, what?
If you're kind of one of those weirdos that likes to decorate, you can decorate.
5:21
I don't think that's a whole, like, the waste of big waste of time.
But yeah, that's the kind of the gist of it overall, so I.
Feel like we should split this into because it really is 2 separate games in my opinion.
5:39
It's the town builder Stardew Valley Simulator with Cult and it's the rogue like hack, Yeah, hack and slash randomly generated dungeon of rooms.
5:56
Very, very similar to.
That one game buying of Isaac and pretty similar to enter the Gungeon except for your weapons are mainly weapons and I feel like they are pretty separate.
6:16
Like you get upgrades for one from the other and you get resources for one for the other, but like there's not a huge amount of like back and forth between them.
I mean the whole point of the town is just to like help you if you suck at the like the the actual crusades because that's all the meta progression that's all the get your power ups and everything.
6:35
But I think like if they didn't have like strict constraints around like you need to have X number of cultists to progress in like opening up a crusade area.
I'm pretty sure that like someone who's good at this kind of game with like the two or three hearts or whatever you start with and like not having upgraded weapons, could just go around and like just.
6:52
To destroy everything because it's not actually a super hard game, at least from my point of view, because unlike Binding of Isaac, you have that dodge roll and dodge roll in.
This kind of a game makes it so so much easier to not get hit and to stay alive.
Yeah, so I I personally spend a lot of time pondering this game because while I didn't like Under the Gungeons combat, I did like this games combat and.
7:20
Boy, they feel very like surface level.
They look very similar.
And I think it's just I I think while playing it I realized I just don't like bullets because and I don't like bullet hell.
Like I'm not very good at shooting out bullets and I'm not very good at dodging bullets.
7:38
So like, the parts of this game that I disliked the most were the times when it got bullet hell sequence stuff.
Because like, you know.
I I I wasn't as good at dodging that but I really liked the loop of you know, I I I got although that the heavy hammer, the slow hit really liked the roll in and try and hit them right as they're coming into you like they're doing their attack and they like move into your strike.
8:04
I felt like that was a really satisfying play style for me as like a test of like timing game thing.
I feel like I had the literally exact opposite reaction where like we I I had like crossed over that Rubicon with Gungeon and I was like okay.
8:25
I see it.
I see the light continuing the the metaphor here that that Gungeon has bestowed upon me and like everything was falling into place and was clicking and like I was getting all the like learning how all the different guns work and project like it's it's everything is a project on there's no Maylay combat like you said in this like yeah like your main attack they're like they're all mainly attacks and you have like a special that can do like you know range things to some degree.
8:53
But I feel like from my perspective, I just didn't think it was as interesting where it it felt very much like dodge roll in, spam spam spam dodge roll out, hit the special regardless of any weapon I equipped.
Yeah, it was great.
9:10
No, I agree.
I agree with Scott and I I I agree that it is it should be complaints and I would put that in the complaint category.
But will you.
You were met on Gungeon.
Did you like did you like the combat here more than Gungeon?
Yeah, OK.
I mean, so I I still, I still think it has room for improvement.
9:27
I thought it.
I think the sequence is Gungeon lowest than this and then at the peak, at least from the games that I've played.
And theoretically, there's probably some better ones.
But Hades is is really the the peak of what this kind of gets to, which is to say like, it's a combination of melee and range.
9:44
And like it has like a shield that you use primarily and you can like do this big charge thing with the shield.
There was like a bow.
There was all kinds of special moves like that is the peak of this kind of like gameplay, I think.
And maybe they didn't want to copy it.
I mean, lots of good games copy other games, but I feel like they could have like taken that theme and like pulled it into this game and that.
10:05
Like the holy sword of like boomerang throw or something or just like something interesting dynamic.
So it's not like, Yep, you hit a button and you smack everything and like this.
Like, feel like in the, you know, 90 degrees in front of you.
And just like, oh that over and over you feel like even even like modifications to how you approach melee combat and be can be super interesting even without like explicitly just copy pasting all the the things from the greatest rogue like of all time Hades.
10:35
Like I got like my my initial vibe from this on the Crusades aspect was very much like Legend of Zelda where like you're running like you have a you have a little dude that runs around and you go slash, slash, slash and like, yeah, that in, you know games like Lynx Awakening or Link to the Past, that's basically all that you do.
10:57
But you have a grappling hook, you have a shield that you can reflect stuff.
You have a feather that you can jump over stuff.
There is there's like lots of other ways that you can modify that kind of combat flow where, yeah, you you have like the one sort that's just the button match, but like, you know, do you have one that can like reflect the bolts back at people?
11:17
Do you have one that has like a charge attack?
Those kinds of things.
I felt like the the weapon variety, like the melee weapon variety here, was disappointingly seamy.
Yeah, I mean it is.
It is surprising to me that they didn't have.
11:33
A single ranged option like they had.
Really, everything was pretty darn close range.
I know why.
I mean like it's it's because the room size, they really, I'm not sure like which which came first the room size of the weapons.
11:52
But like all the rooms were extremely small and so if you had a range weapon it was like it was it was awkward and like the rooms are also shaped too and so it was like it.
Didn't and like into a lot of obstacles in the way sometimes.
And so it just felt like, yeah, well, the utility then kind of gets cut down dramatically if you can't actually have the space to use the weapon.
12:13
I kind of want to talk my perception.
Just like the first act of this game is by far its strongest.
I kind of want to talk about the intro to this game a little because I like that.
That hooked me like like a trout in mating season.
Like, super.
Like it's a very strong start.
12:31
So our our story with Cult of the Lamb here begins with a very was it 2021 when the Dune movie came out.
But it it like I got like a like a dune drop like right at the start.
We're like black screen text and like nonsense language saying praise the lamb conduit to great power promise Liberator of the one who waits below.
12:54
Yet sacrifice sacrificial beast.
Take heed for a crowd cannot a crown it says crowded in the script.
It's crossed out.
That's why I got confused.
For a crown cannot sit upon 2 brows like that.
That kind of just like Bam sets the tone of like OK, some serious shit's about to go down and then your your little lamb character is in like this terrifying intro sequence where you have like the the credits going past is very thematic and you're being led down to the sacrificial altar in front of the four bosses that you have to fight for this game executioner comes up, drops the axe and surprise you're in some kind of like if if it was appropriate that like light mode ID E's were hell then this would work really well.
13:44
You you're sent into a very bright hell like area to meet the one who waits, this other kind of large boss looking figure who's wrapped in chains and you're given their crown and sent back in order to fulfill their requests.
14:08
So you get sent back to their execution chamber and you kill all those guards and you meet an NPC who kind of gives you the the lowdown of of how things are to be done in this game and then you this is your tutorial zone.
You are fighting through your gungeon Isaac the you know your procedurally generated bespoke rooms where they are kind of randomly attached to each other.
14:35
We've seen this before and other kind of games here, eventually finding the little mini boss for for this floor.
You fight and kill them and then they deconvert from this goofy monster looking thing to a cute little farm animal with big cartoon eyes.
14:54
And how would we describe the art style of this game?
Like paper cut out.
Yeah, it's kind of the Don't Starve.
Yeah, I think they they, I think they're the ones that start like Paper Mario I think was like their original like you know or maybe not Paper Mario, but it's it's 2D on 3D.
It's Don't Starve If it was a little bit less like Don't Starve is really like everything is wonky angles.
15:18
It's it's basically Don't Starve but without the wonky angles, but still with like the fat lines and the cutesy graphics.
Very cutesy.
I like the the the main character is little, like the little dance that the Lamb is constantly doing is one of the biggest selling points in the game.
It just like it's back and forth and it's just so happy and and it's moods, it's moods are always just like this.
15:37
Either super like jubilant and like joyous or just like extreme fear or anger is like that's all it has.
It's extreme and that I love that juxtaposition.
That was really good too.
You know, like.
This feels like the kind of game that like looking at the aesthetics of just the Sprite characters alone, it's like right on the edge of something like I probably wouldn't like it, but somehow they managed to do it in a way that I really do like.
16:06
And I think it's helped a lot by the backgrounds are somewhat less cutesy and the like very visually interesting and then also all of the sounds.
All of the music absolutely slaps.
16:22
The music in this game is so good.
All of the sound effects are amazing.
The voices of like that when they do like their Symbolish or the Animal Crossing are like really weirdly riveting.
16:40
And so I think that like tripped me into like liking the, liking all of it as part of like a whole package of cutesy contrasted with.
A weirdly serious tone.
I, you know, like it works really well.
16:57
Like, really, Cult?
It's it's drawing you in with its innocence before it drops the hammer on you.
And Oh my God, no.
Actually, this game is a ton of grinding.
Yeah, I mean the music has been playing in my head constantly for like 4 days because I've been.
Spending so much time in my stupid village, grinding out food for my stupid cultists.
17:17
He chose the wrong ritual then, but.
I mean, really, I was trying to take care of my people too much.
So I feel like this game really, really strong.
Start pretty deep.
Pit in the middle.
And then the end game starts getting good again.
17:34
So I'm glad.
I I'm glad I ground through the middle part to get to the end.
Because by the end you're just like, oh, right, The cultures just don't matter.
You just don't care about them so much.
Like a true cult leader.
Yeah, I think, like, I don't know if I'm just like trying to be like too empathetic to like these stupid little cartoons that are like, so, so like Tutorial Zone, you come to your your cult farm colony area management zone, which I what did you guys name your cults?
18:06
I went with Groglitism for mine, so that way I could call.
It Groglit Cult just a lamb.
Yeah, I was I.
Didn't rename a single person.
Or thing I don't do customization of that.
I like the weird little names of all the little cult people, but so you come to you come to your main camp area and this is where you can do your over world like region select to go talk to.
18:28
Like other Npc's and vendors.
You can select options to like build things and have your followers go build them or like you can join in with the building.
There's cooking stations so you can make food and the little like action mini games for cooking the food question mark.
18:49
This is where you also indoctrinate followers that you find out on your crusades.
And then you have the probably the two biggies are the shrine where you get your divine inspiration unlocks which allow you to build more stuff.
And those are the things that all of your little little dudes are praying to.
19:07
And your temple, which is where you do your sermons, rituals, and doctrines.
Which God.
If I didn't write these down there would be no way for me to remember like what the difference between any of these were.
But yeah, I had to.
I had to call in the big guns and have will like grade my streaming for this cuz I was like okay I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
19:29
Like I built a bunch of stuff like I threw a bunch of lanterns down cuz that seemed like a good idea and all my followers are unhappy and Will was like, my God what are you doing?
Everyone's just starving.
There's poop everywhere.
There's no faith because.
He's not giving.
19:45
Any sermons?
He just, it's just like he didn't even, like, read any of the text.
I mean, as some of the complaints about what we've done in the past for other games.
Oh yeah, well, you didn't read the thing.
Well, of course you don't know how it works.
I mean, I thought it was following the directions because I figured that me a an omnipotent.
20:01
Or maybe, I don't know, like you're you're not the God, you're just his.
You're the prophet, I think.
You're the, you're the.
Prophet You're the Jesus to the God.
The body of the one who waits but I felt like.
And there the blood that you are going to sacrifice and drink.
20:18
You're call tests I mean.
I'm amazed that there was so much manual.
What's the StarCraft?
For it.
Like manual APM for like.
20:34
APM, just micromanagement for stuff.
I'm like, OK, I'm supposed to be like an omnipotent being here to some degree.
Why am I the one that's cooking food for everyone and like picking up their poop and stuff?
20:49
Like where's the building for me to unlock to have it auto do this?
Yeah, picking up their their poop is the stupidest part of this game.
Like I hate it.
Yeah, I hate it.
I hate it on a conceptual level.
21:05
I hate it just I think it's stupid and I don't want it.
Like even if it was something else that was exactly the same, like, I just would prefer a different mechanic.
It just feels stupid to me.
I was.
21:22
Watching some like various speed runners of this game because I wanted to know like okay the critical path to like finishing this game.
How necessary is this colony management part?
And well, I think you were saying like it's basically superfluous.
21:37
Like you basically don't need it at all.
Like, if you're good enough at the hack and slash combat, like the colony management part is almost meaningless.
I didn't actually get to.
I know we talked about it, but I never actually watched the speed run.
I should actually do that.
But like, what was the?
Well, I'm just curious, what did that path look like?
21:53
Is it like, what did they cut out that surprised you the most?
They they basically didn't do anything with the colony like at all.
Like all they would do is just go on a crusade and farm followers to meet the requirement to unlock a new level.
22:09
So so your various biomes here, your your your overall end goal here is to kill the the four main mini bosses, each one in a different Biome.
Like a woodsy by or like a summer forest and autumnal forest and underwater realm like a twilight cave.
22:25
Very cool art designs for each of these, but they have follower requirements where in order to almost kind of like Mario 64 like star unlock requirements, you must be this many followers high in order to pass and then you're able to unlock that zone.
22:47
Go in and start a crusade.
And what a crusade is, you know, we've touched on this earlier is it's that kind of like randomized like FTL style branching tree.
No, no, no.
It's Spire like that is the term and I think we got to attribute it, just lay the Spire.
23:03
It's no FTL, invented it.
It's an FTL like sorry you You pilot your spaceship through the summer forest along these different paths.
And you, you can like come across different nodes that are like, oh, this gives you like resources.
23:23
This is a combat one.
This is one that gives you a follower.
This one gives you tarot cards or you know, things that kind of like meta progress in a way.
And so coming back to the speedrun bit like the speedrunner guy would just like, he would just go in like get the man or get the follower, get out and just like.
23:44
Turn that crank as fast as you possibly could just so we could like okay alright, go to the Biome.
Each Biome.
By the way, you have to beat the a mini boss for four times before you fight the major boss. 33 mini bosses in each Biome and then the major boss of that Biome.
24:00
Okay, yeah, that's correct.
Which also like feels like additionally more grindy than it needs to be.
The first time I went through, I'm like, okay, mate, Like, I guess we'll see where this is going.
So the speed runners would would go through, they would like, collect followers.
24:17
And then like anytime that they would come to come back to camp, like, you know, follower awaits indoctrination.
They would walk over to the thing and it was like literally like two or three minutes nonstop of like follower pops up, you know, like random, like clicking through the next, next, next, next, next button to like.
24:34
Follower, follower, follower, follower.
And it was just like a constant stream of them until he had enough.
He's like all right now, go to the next one, like man.
Even from like a speed run perspective that doesn't really seem that fun.
No, I mean each one of those little like the first time.
I think everyone's right here with like the first time you see any of the the new things and like oh, it seems really cool like that little like the the the when you're actually indoctrinating someone they like come up through this little portal and they look all scared and they're like, you know please let me join you.
25:01
I'll be a good.
And then you're just like, yes, you know, you're this kind of in your your God Mode of your, your lamb States and you like in doc, you like, say the magic words essentially.
And you like float up in the air.
It's a very cool thing.
And then you have to wait and and go through that so, so many times.
25:18
And that's like, and that's what it is just to even talk to someone.
It's like you walk up to them and suddenly it like, it slows down into this like really clunky menu or like mind read.
And there's like all these little options.
You want to like, inspire people in the beginning, like, oh, I need to inspire people all the time.
25:33
I need to make.
Sure, when you're inspiring 3 people, it's not hard.
When you're trying to inspire 20 people individually, go to every single one of them.
Well, I mean, like you can they group together.
I think they've finally understood that.
Oh yeah.
But like, that's so stupid.
That's so stupid.
25:49
There needs to be like like a click drag like like there's an element here where like an RTS would really help the UI.
I feel like just like click drag all followers like okay now you are everyone go mine.
All right, now everyone go chop lumber.
Well, I think, I think it's a common like fault of this game is that you can't like the first part's good and then you can't skip through it once you the novelty has worn off.
26:14
So when I was fighting the last boss.
It took me like four tries and you cannot skip the cutscene and.
Like, it's really like the final, final boss fight.
26:31
Or well, I don't.
Whatever the.
I mean how much.
All right.
Look here is for spoilers.
Eventually you fight the the like the one who waits and then after that there's more stuff that you can do and you can do.
It's not the final thought of us I don't think.
26:46
But anyway, fighting the one who waits.
You can't cut, you can't skip through the cut scheme, and you have to listen to, like them tell you the same things over and over.
It's like, oh, this guy's going to come out and he says he doesn't even say something different.
It's the same thing each time I wait a minute, actually, I think that if you die and you go back to like the little Bishop dudes, I'm pretty sure that was there was a way to like go speed through that.
27:11
There was a lot of slowness to like the getting, like getting there, and there were areas that you couldn't skip.
I don't know if it's like an option menu because I did see the speedrunner guy, like that dialogue was whizzing fast like.
But like some things, they actually speed.
Maybe I maybe I just didn't attempt hard enough to to go fast through that, but like.
27:29
Smash that a button.
I just.
Wanted to click a faster and have it be like skip and I'm like I mean like and it does that it does the full like.
Boss intro animation where it's like, oh, you followed the thing and the room goes dark and then something, something, something and some eyes pop up and it's like it's not that long but it's like 1015 seconds.
27:49
You being like, cool.
I've seen this.
I saw it like 10 minutes ago.
You should just beat him the first time.
Duh.
Actually take me.
Five tries.
So I'm not good.
Terrible that you you beat me.
I don't.
I mean, yeah, I don't know how it was like four or five.
Honestly the the most trouble I had was with the second boss.
28:08
For some reason I just couldn't beat his stupid weird crab or whatever it was.
I don't remember.
And then I had to go back and grind the the followers more.
And that was the start of the like, grind, because I think I had just been trying to not engage with the the Followers stuff as much and then I had to go grind because I'm not actually good at video games.
28:30
And then I was like, this game must be like, you have to get good And then I ground for a long time and then I cruised through the rest of the game with no problem.
But related to follower management and kind of like God games to some degree.
Like I'm like barely getting my pinky toe wet with Rim world.
28:51
You two are both Rim World fans.
As I mentioned.
I'm so jealous of you.
Yeah.
So to be able to start anew and know nothing about Rim world.
Wow.
It feels like the the Coney SIM aspect here could could be, I don't know, like there's there's something like a little bit of spice from Rim World put in here, a little bit of spice from Stacklands previous episode.
29:22
A little bit of grind, that pepper grinder, just a little bit of worsen in here for the colony bits.
And I feel like that's that's what's missing out of the Stew for me is like, there's which part?
All of, like all of those things.
29:38
Like, I don't, I don't know exactly what I'm what I want out of it, but I want like just shake a shake, a shake, a little bit of rim where like give it a little taste.
Does that does that make it better?
I don't know.
Like I feel like the the little ponds like running around doing their things.
And you telling them roughly what to do and each one having like their own kind of system of feelings and you're trying to keep them happy and things happen.
30:01
Like this game makes me want to play RIM World more as someone that hasn't really like, dabbled in it much to this degree yet, if that makes sense.
I mean, it should be 90% Rim World, like 10% Dwarf Fortress, I think that's really, but I mean, then it becomes a different game, right?
30:21
And and actually I.
Think it should be.
I mean, so I think that you're missing the key that's Star Do Valley because it's basically Star Do Valley with follow my mistake.
Yes, that's that's correct.
Like I wanted the ponds.
This felt to me too, much like Star Do Valley.
30:37
But you have to feed a horde of hungry followers.
When I wanted to be Star Do Valley but you've.
Brainwashed people into harvesting all the crops for you and also some of them becoming your wife maybe.
Maybe many of them.
I mean, to be fair, all that stuff is in this game as is.
30:57
But you can't unlock it, of course, that way it takes.
Too long to get to the like the true true automation like I wanted it to be automated earlier.
Automation should be like step one or like step Step 2.
Like step one.
I feel like, you know, oh, like.
31:13
The the the Prophet is working in the fields with me.
How I feel so inspired.
Ohh that like that feels like thematically kind of appropriate for for like a brainwashing simulator type game.
But after that, like, look, I'm a prophet.
I'm a busy man.
31:28
I got to go run to political conferences.
I have people I have to bribe and I need money.
So I'm busy all the time.
I can't chop down lumber.
Like I can't cook food for all you.
I can't pick up your own guys's food.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, I think the automation was a little too slow.
31:47
And then like that ended up being all of the end game.
Colony management stuff was just like getting to the automation and it's like, okay, cool, now you're you're the the end game was where I felt like the middle game should be and then there wasn't the end game.
32:05
Like you built a statue and it's like, cool, there's a statue now.
So, like, I don't.
Like, I don't.
I don't know what like what the the true end game for the village simulator is.
It's probably worth noting that when this game launched, like it did receive some criticism of like, it seems kind of kind of light on content and I don't like.
32:29
I don't know if that's true.
I think it's more like like gameplay like this.
This will sound harsh, like sound interwoven gameplay mechanics that.
Like that.
I don't know if that's something that you can plug in to fix all these disparate systems, but they have had so far one content update and they have two more planned in the pipe.
32:55
Still I believe okay.
Now I don't know, like I don't know what your guys's take is on like what do you want to see out of those two content updates I.
Know Will has an opinion on this.
Go for it.
Well okay.
So I've got a list of what like wolf 123-4567 things but okay the two things top of mind without actually like reading everything in my list here are one is Haiti style weapons like you just the weapon system is just too bad right now that's that's got to be fixed.
33:23
Give me like boomerangs give me things that are like ricochet.
I things give me like just more in like give me something interesting.
I don't want the same weapon at different speeds, essentially.
You know what I want?
This is sorry.
I'm going to derail you.
I want a weapon where it's just you get horns and you ram stuff.
Brilliant.
33:38
See you should be on the team.
That's that's great.
Second thing and this is the thing that I think will really transform the way the game works in a really positive way And it steal.
It does steal from rim world, but it isn't the calling management side of it.
33:54
It's the raid side of it, the tower defense side of it.
Like as soon as you're as soon as your colony suddenly you care about your colonists that like, Oh yeah, this guy right here he's the one that's like the really the strong guy that's going to be the melee guy.
You're going to have.
Like you're going to set up automated turrets.
34:10
You're going to like set up like little towers or like little moats or pits, pongy sticks.
Like you're you're going out there and fucking up these these deities and they have all these followers and it takes you four times going in there.
Obviously they know you're coming and they're going to be like, well, the best way the best defense is a good offense and they're going to send hordes at you.
34:27
And so to balance out the kind of the going out on the Crusades with the coming back with all these resources and building up your defenses just seems to make a lot of sense and it just would make that you care a lot more about.
I like that a lot, actually.
I know I'm just, I should be making these games.
34:44
I know.
I'm just thinking the game genius over here.
And that could be a good resource suck for a lot of things and then the end game is like you being able to like maybe it's.
By the time you're at the end game, you don't have to be there for those Reds anymore, which lets you just go crusade all the time.
35:01
But like in the beginning you you are like the main defender of the cult kind of thing.
Yeah, I do have a note written in my Google doc here of like.
It seems like a missed opportunity to not be able to send like your your brainwashed followers out on crusades for you or like join you or like do some kind of like militaristic indoctrination or something like that.
35:21
They have that you didn't progress that far I think.
Really.
Okay.
Yeah, you get the you can.
You can have their souls be possessed by demons and then they come along with you.
But I felt like I didn't really.
I didn't love that mechanic.
It felt like they were pretty small boosts.
35:37
Which is good, because actually like having a followers annoying and I don't think that you like.
As Will said before, I don't think there's physically room to add much more onto a map.
Yeah, those rooms are compared to Gunjin.
Like these rooms are what, like a third of the size?
35:53
1/4 of the size.
Even yeah, you can like fit them on the screen.
Yeah.
Which I mean it does, kind of.
Yeah, it's not terrible.
It's just.
It's a, It's a.
Restriction on how you can build it.
Right.
And I think, like, I like Will's idea a lot more than like the note that I have written down of like, oh, I should send my, you know, my followers out on Crusades door, fortress style.
36:16
Like, I like that tension of the like, the idea of the tension of like, OK, I'm going to go out on a crusade.
There's the risk that my base might get invaded or something like that.
But.
Right.
And maybe you have to.
Maybe it's it is in the process of being invaded and you're like, I could try to finish the crusade.
36:33
Keep all of my resources and then go back.
Or go back now lose a bunch of the resources that I've gained, but defend the colony like just there there.
It seems like there wasn't enough interaction between the rogue like element and the village building element.
36:50
And yeah, I had like another note that I have just below that is the death loop part of this seems like ironically backwards from like a cult perspective for like you'd think that like if your prophet died.
And literally came back right in front of you.
Like that would just deepen all the followers resolve, right?
37:08
Instead of like having them like lose faith and I think like you lose resources to on a failed crusade and all that you lose surprisingly little actually.
I think it's it was like a percent of the whole and like I know during the the summer sale I got these 13 games and one of them what is what is it the Doug the OR was it something the diver the.
37:29
Dave the Diver, Dave the diver, just forgotten they were.
But like the one of the the interesting things about that is that like if you die while you're out on your, you know, similar to a crusade, you bring back one item and so you lose like everything except.
And that's I think that's because like you might get a quest item and they don't want you to lose that.
37:45
But like on this game, it's like, yeah, you lose.
Like, I don't remember exactly what it was, 25%.
It should be that you keep 25%.
Yeah I did feel like wow you're they really don't trying to shoot much at all for death and so I mean not that you die very much at least I I didn't the recommended normal difficulty and I feel like that was probably a mistake in hindsight but I think I think I didn't I died once to see what would happen if I died like during the entire game up until the in the in the final fight where I died four times before beating him on the 5th.
38:15
So it's a yeah, death is not not a big deal at all in this game, which I mean, I guess thematically makes sense, right?
I mean you're you've got this deity that like will not let you die that just keeps bringing you back.
And then just like, yeah, I'm, I like the Haiti style.
38:31
Like, yeah, you just get brought back again.
So so later in the game you unlock the ability to if you die on your crusade, you can sacrifice one of your followers to, like, resurrect and continue that fight.
38:49
I feel like that should be a base part of the game and it should be a non negotiable.
You have to like if you lose, if you die during one of your raids and your your crusades, I think one of your followers should die and you are like that's how you're resurrected.
39:08
It's in in like the actual like village.
At all.
So like, you know, it's it's like, oh, that's how you're resurrected because it also just felt like, oh, the guys just like bringing you back or something.
And then it would it would kind of drive the you have to you have to make your village better in order so that you aren't, like, losing your followers, like you could get into a death spiral kind of thing.
39:34
Yeah, I think that would.
That's a a good way to kind of keep that focus back on your followers again.
That's true, yeah.
Is is the the Biome like the boss Biome progress here?
Like so far we've seen a lot of games where it's very sequential where it's like OK you're going through act one, then act two, then act 3 then act four or floor one through floor 4 on a single run.
40:01
Whereas with this it's like, OK go into floor one complete, complete.
I'll come back to that later or maybe I'll go into like.
Act Act 2, Biome 2 kind of a thing complete complete, come back to it later.
Would this be better if they were forced to be sequential like in slave aspire, FTL or like you have to go through Biome one and like obviously not doing like the four part routine but like go through Biome one beat that boss then you have to fight and kill the boss of Biome 2 and progress that way.
40:30
Would that be any better?
In in in my view.
How I did it.
Yeah, that's that's pretty much how I did it.
I wanted to finish out an area while I still had all our attacks like memorized and like and then do the next one, memorize patterns and move on.
Like it didn't make a difference.
40:45
Like from the the games point of view like the order and what you did things it like it made a difference for like the resources you got to some extent but those resources are like the unique ones.
They can only be spent in the like in the overworld, in the like specific area you unlocked like what was it like the mushroom area being unlocked, the sea area.
41:05
So if you got like mushroom.
You could spend them at the like.
That was a super lame aspect of it and that's kind of like that.
That really is the only reason I wanted to focus on one area first is so that I can finish an area and never go back there because there was no reason to and just kind of check that off as to do is unless you need lumber, you need those sweet lumber drops.
41:25
Yeah, well, you know, I managed my my villagers well enough that I never needed to worry about life.
Some people here, I mean you still get sweet lumber drops in all of the biomes.
So will talk to me about this ML model about for knuckle bones that you built.
41:41
I didn't actually build it cuz that, so yeah, okay.
Yeah, it's good that you bring up Knuckle Bones, which is the mini game, which some games out there have really great mini games.
Like, obviously, I think the one that comes to mind is like Witcher is Gwent.
41:57
And like how I essentially only played Witcher to play Gwent because I thought that was the most fun mini game ever.
And in like a Kingdom, what does it Kingdom come Something deliverance.
Yeah sounds right.
There's there's a dice rolling game that's I'm forgetting the name of Farbel Fable.
42:17
Sparkle.
Sparkle.
Yeah, yeah.
And that was like a fun mini game.
I I mean, like, it was entertaining to some degree in.
This game War SIM, which literally you only oh, I didn't even engage with the real game at all.
That's true.
The mini game was the game for me, like in this.
42:32
And so when I got to this and I was still like getting into the game, I got the intro.
So you know, I'm still like learning everything.
All this, like everything's feels so good.
I'm feeling like, Oh my goodness, this is going to be an 8.9 and 9.0 game.
I just, I'm so excited right now and they introduced a dice rolling mini game.
Like Oh my goodness, this is gonna be great.
42:50
And I get into it and and and to be honest like it's it has a surprising amount of depth to it.
It's just a simple like.
Rolling one die at a time back and forth and builds, building out like like the first to finish a set of nine dies to essentially or not the first to finish.
43:08
But that's ends the game and the ones with the highest score wins.
And there's like a bunch of like you know an adding system.
I'm not going to explain all the rules to this but I got like I money.
I was money tight in the beginning and I was just like, Oh my goodness, if I can solve this puzzle of like, how to optimize this game, I can just get tons and tons of money and then I won't.
43:23
Then I I love breaking the game.
And like, that was my goal.
And so I was like I was starting to build out like okay let's, I want to build a a model that will have optimal play and I'm going to have to do simulations.
I'm going to have to do some.
I'm always going to build in some reinforcement learning so that I could be like okay.
43:38
I'm going to have agents training against each other just and just see what happens.
And that way I can just be like, oh tell me what optimal play is because it's not super obvious.
And I like watch some tutorials online and like people are like coming up with these principles which.
Were okay or not, Like, they weren't.
43:53
I couldn't tell.
Like statistically speaking if they were actually accurate, it just like, yeah, this seems right.
So I'll do that.
That was kind of like the gist of it.
I'm like, that's unsatisfying.
I want the statistics.
And then.
And then I got a ritual.
The ritual, which is like, you asked all your your dudes for money and then suddenly had more money than I knew what to do with.
44:11
And I could use that ritual whenever I needed money, essentially.
And so the idea of optimizing.
This money.
I had 1400 coins at one point.
Right.
Exactly.
And so it was just like, it really ruined any motivation to build that out.
And I just, like, totally.
44:28
It sucks.
Like the rituals are the most overpowered, stupid thing in the game.
That's like if you are Tara bad at the game, if you have one brain cell, then use those things to help you out because you don't have to feed your villagers.
You don't have to like do anything to manage their like their their their faith.
44:48
You can get all the money you need from them.
It's just you can kill off the old people.
You can kill off old people.
You can it's you can bring people back from the dead if you didn't want them to die.
Like, it's all just it's.
It's it's it's it's a dumb I I think it's a dumb mechanic.
45:05
Like I understand why they did it, but they need to like figure out a way to balance it better because they really they ruined what could have been a really fun mini game and like a really fun coding thing for me.
Also a sidebar will I think they patched out the your meta game exploitation strategy and Warson by just like constantly betting in the arena.
45:22
Because I went back and I was, I was like trying to do that and like, well, let's let's.
Because my goal was like okay, there's something here with like colony SIM differences between like this game Stacklands and war SIM.
Let's go back to war SIM and just kind of like screw around for a little bit and see what happens.
And I was like, all right let's let's do the will method.
45:40
Like go all in on, you know the fighter that's obviously going to win.
And spoiler alert, the peasant beat the the fire berserker goblin.
But anyway, like the the arena runs out of money now.
And now, like, I can't just, like, constantly keep, like, pumping money into the arena.
45:58
Ran out before too, did it?
Yeah, like every turn there's a limit.
And you have.
To maximize it, you have to invest back in the arena in order to have to have more money.
Yeah, certain perks to increase the arenas like size and the amount of like the amount of wealth or the turns.
46:14
I don't remember the details, but so yeah, you have to do a little bit of investment early on and that was like the on the critical path to earning massive amounts of money.
Well, I think there's still like, there's elements of like, I also I also booted back up Stacklands because I'm like, OK, like farming like management kind of like goofiness simulation stuff Here.
46:35
I wound up accidentally forgetting to feed my my one villager that I had and he died and I lost on like turn one in Stackland somehow.
But like I went back to those to kind of figure out like OK what what did those games have that were good, that was was kind of missing from here.
46:50
And I feel like the, the delegation and automation aspects are sorely missing.
Where like I as as the godhead, like it's it's fine to like be involved in the drudgery of, you know, the masses for the first couple, I don't know, days or so of the game, but like establish those treadmills and like, just let those paper clips print themselves.
47:17
It's anti thematic for you to be harvesting stuff after like.
The.
Early game.
Yep.
I think.
I think that they really could have just stolen like just straight up stolen the colony manager from from RIM World because that that is just like here's a here like all the tasks and you can like prioritize them too.
47:35
It's just simple 123 or you can.
I think it was just like on or off would even be fine.
But just I don't want to have to run around and talk to every single cultist.
I want to manage that from a menu and then have them look at my bulletin board because I'm the cult leader and I just like, say this is what you're doing now and like.
47:51
Yeah.
Maybe, maybe.
Maybe when you give your sermon, rather than it just being like a sermon where nothing happens, you just give a sermon and they love you more.
Maybe that's when you maybe you can only set your priorities once a day and it's during your sermon and you're convincing them, Hey guys, today's the day you're going to farm real good for the glory of me going to farm those leader beans.
48:17
Yeah, let's see.
Anything else we have we have to say about Lambs and Colts?
Thought from the characters maybe?
Like any thoughts on like the the introduction of like a fisherman fish on the little mushroom dudes or any of those things that the gold, the gold.
48:41
Like the Midas area, which is I thought the the, the interaction that I had the fisherman guy was was fun and interesting and like again, very kind of emblematic of this game.
Like once once you've seen it, it's like oh I don't really know if I really want to come back to this.
48:59
Like yeah, doing the fishing mini game like talking like again, art design art style art direction.
Incredible like top of the line like talking to the fisherman guy he had like this really hilarious like Banjo Kazooie if like there were like subtotal gluttle stops as he was talking.
49:17
I'm like this is like.
His insistence that he wasn't a fish.
Like it's it's really funny.
Like it's it's really engaging.
But there's there's like an aspect of like OK well why should I come back here later that in games like like Legend like Legend of Zella links Awakening Link to the past.
49:38
Like, there's there's like these subtle, like overworld things that happen, like, oh, like by interacting with this person, it allows like some other aspect of interacting with another NPC to unlock.
And there's like those interesting interactions there.
49:54
But I like, again, in the five or six hours that I put into it so far, I haven't really been hooked by that yet.
I did the fishing mini game for a little bit.
I'm like, OK, this is fun.
But like, again, I'm just like grinding it.
Was fun.
It was fun.
50:10
It was fun for the 1st 5 minutes and then I'm like it.
Was novel, yeah, Yeah, that's more accurate.
It was novel and going in like lighting the lighthouse thing, I'm like, oh that's novel.
And I get there was like some like Fox and PC that I was able to talk to like dog guy at night that I talked to like this is interesting.
50:29
But man, just like the the resource grinding really grinds my gears and really like again, if I was just like had a button to say followers, just mine all this stuff for me and like grow your own food and clean up your own poop, treadmill it and automate it from like even just like the Tier 2 level upgrades, I would be much more convinced to jump back in because then I don't have to worry about that stuff.
50:55
You really need to do go back.
You need to play Factorio.
I think that would really solve all of your needs.
Again, I can't.
I can't go too deep into Factorio because I know I will never see the light of day ever again.
Well, that's the problem.
Yes, that's, that's fair enough.
51:11
Fair enough.
Like once.
So like just give me some conveyor belts to put followers on and have like the little robot arm put them into the the chest for for resources like I don't like.
Yeah I can.
I can mine Cole by hand for fun for like the 1st 10 minutes.
51:27
No problem.
I can set up the automated drillers no problem.
Just give me that treadmill to do so and.
I'll say you said that you you went to five, five or six hours or something like that.
Yep.
You're halfway through.
Yeah.
So like 13 hours was the total time I put into the game.
51:43
And that's including, like, time that I just left it running where I did the other stuff.
Yeah.
But I mean, like with the speedrunner, I watched like the end cinematics.
I'm just, oh, you're yeah.
I don't know.
Like there's.
No reason.
Yeah, there really is no after you.
I'd say after you beat the second boss or the first boss, first and a half, like you've got the idea.
52:01
And it's just that on repeat, it's grinding that.
Yeah, I think they, I think the game play becomes a little bit more enjoyable near the end of it, but it's not substantially different.
Mostly just you stop caring about.
Yeah, you have the rituals to make it so easy to do the follower management that you can't lose.
52:20
You're just like, oh, they're unhappy.
Well, I'll just do the thing that.
Makes them drugged and they're at 100% happy.
That's true.
That's room one.
That was a good one.
Way over.
That it's like, well, there you go.
They're not unhappy anymore.
I don't have to worry about it.
I'll go back to fighting monsters.
52:36
I might be convinced to come back if like the next two content updates.
Yeah, like change, like the meta game.
Substantially like.
There is POST.
There is POST.
I I mean, I think technically we're probably only like halfway through the content after you beat the final boss, like you have the whole you don't play all of them again and you get them as your followers and blah blah blah.
52:59
But yeah, you can go through all of the biomes again when now they're harder.
And then you get the the like the monsters as your followers or the the God people as your followers.
Oh man, no.
As soon as I beat the main guy, I thought.
That was the end.
53:14
Of it, and I was glad to be done.
I.
Was like, I'm not going to do that.
I feel like I've.
I've scratched that itch, as it were, so.
But yeah, maybe if they come out with more content and they made the rest of the also.
I had literally maxed out all the trees.
53:30
Me too.
So it was like, there's no other progress on this front.
It would just be more fighting.
And the fighting was fine, but not quite enough to like keep going.
So you want to do scores?
Yeah, let's let's jump into rankings.
53:46
I'll go first this time because I think I'm going to be the biggest downer.
Yeah, I think like the the meta game is the toughest part for me.
Like the.
I think the story premise is great, excellent art design, the music, really good knuckle bones, really fun mini game.
54:05
If that was like guentified to like other Npc's and like so again this this isn't like it's so easy for me to say yeah just make the game into Legend of Zelda easy.
All of your problems are solved.
But like instead of having the separate even I don't know like the separate biomes that you walk to to like the different NBC vendors there's there's some there's some thematic overlap there with like different biomes from like linked to the past or links awakening that like is is close.
54:37
Like it's it's touching those two.
Like the neurons are like so close to each other, but like, they're not overlapping quite yet.
I think I'm going to I'm going to ape a George Carlin stand up routine here for for my final ranking.
The Lamb has actually convinced people that there's an omnipotent spirit living in the sky who watches everything you do every minute of every day.
55:00
And the Spirit has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do.
And if you do any of these 10 things, he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever until the end of time.
55:18
But he loves you.
He loves you.
And he needs lumber.
He always needs lumber.
He's all powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.
But somehow he just can't handle lumber.
And that's why it is my 14th ranked game, below fights in tight spaces and just ahead of Stacklands out of the 27 reviewed so far.
55:42
I think this game like is like better, does not.
Well, is more like a higher production value than Stacklands, which like, again, kind of punching above its weight.
But I just was I'm I'm waiting for that hook, and that hook hasn't gotten to get there yet.
56:02
Yeah, I'll go next and I'll say that I had that hook, I had the strong hook.
I would say that it like based off the first quarter or third of the game, I would have put it like probably number four or five and then the mid game just ground.
56:20
It was a lot of grinding that I felt emotionally unable to just not manage my followers.
Like I'm too much of A completionist and like knowing that they were there and got there, got to do the thing every day.
56:39
Got to make sure that the sermon I got to talk to all the people.
And then once I stopped loving my followers and started just sacrificing them and eating their their dead bodies as cannibal, I enjoyed the last of it more.
Definitely things to work on or things, things that could be made better.
56:55
I will.
I don't know if I'll play it again once the new content stuff comes out, but I'll definitely like, check in on it because I'll be curious how they weave more content in.
It does feel a little bit content like at the moment, but it feels like there's a lot of room that they could add stuff in.
57:14
Like there's other games, there's like, oh, this game wasn't great and I don't really know how they would add more stuff in to make it better.
This feels like it is.
A blossoming flower that could grow into an even more awesome blossoming flower.
So I I'm putting it by #9 out of 27, so pretty pretty solidly up there.
57:33
I think it's definitely still in my recommend category.
Like I still think it's a very good game.
I think if you're going to go play it, just don't care about your followers so much in the mid game, you don't need to.
57:51
You don't have to grind if you don't want to, and that I think that I can't.
I can't make them cry.
Yeah, well, that'll be fine I think.
I think once you start killing them, that's when you realize, Oh yeah, I actually don't care about them.
Yeah, once you can't remember what their names are anymore because you have 20 of them, so.
58:11
Probably they should have named them all after the people I know.
That way.
You know when they actually got killed by something.
You know, by, you know, getting a?
Disease or something.
I'd be like, Oh no, Scott's dying.
No, that would make you sacrifice me much faster.
Yeah, it was just true.
Yeah.
58:26
Actually, because you're like, no, you're.
Cold a week, Cold a week, Yeah, actually I just, I just updated mine.
I realized I think I get rated it early on, before I actually finished it.
And I think not so early on that I was in the first third, but I had it at a 7.5.
58:44
And that .5 makes a difference because there's a lot of games I have at 7.5.
I just knocked it down to a seven out of 10 and in our rankings.
Then that makes it in 9th place and and so just let's see.
That means it's slightly worse for you though, because I just had to update the Google sheet and it dropped the average rank from.
59:04
It didn't didn't drop the average rank that bad.
It was at 10 and then dropped down to 11 afterwards.
OK.
Yeah.
So that seems about right.
Yeah but like because I was looking at like Binding of Isaac Rebirth and I had a 7.5 that is a better game.
It's not like it's it doesn't have as much production value but it has a better like the synergy building while you're on a run matters.
59:26
That is a huge source of fun for me.
Like I, I I just went through luck be a landlord and that game is just the distillation of synergy building as fast as you can and like an almost like an auto battler and like.
Yep, that for me, that was a nine out of 10 game just as a that was a that's been a really fun game by the way.
59:46
But stay tuned.
Yeah.
But well, yeah, I guess that would fit into the category.
It would, yeah.
That's I just boiled.
But yeah so that's a good game and FTL also better fights and tight spaces better these are all seven point fives hand of fate too And then like what's worse is like streets of Rogue and well stack lands I do I have is worse as well.
1:00:08
So yeah, I think we all kind of like somewhat agree here.
It looks like in terms of the rankings and I'm going to come back to you like what the game needs is Haiti style weapon, not only the weapons selection but the synergy building as you go on a run.
Because as you're going out, all you're doing is selecting different weapons that are just slightly more powerful.
1:00:26
Like there's no synergies at all.
And then having like the raid style kind of maybe tower defense sort of thing on your on your base.
There's a lot of other things, but I think those two things would really bump it up into the 8.59 category.
Like I initially thought it might land because it's got such a strong narrative, it's got such a strong style to it.
1:00:45
I love that stuff.
And then they just kind of decided to go with like some of the core gameplay mechanics.
So to get at least a six on wills list that have to has to involve you being the Satan figure, you killing God and some kind of antibiblical imagery, that stuff.
1:01:02
That stuff helps a lot for me if yeah, killing God is a strong theme in my life in general.
And so yeah, that that works for me.
All right, well, so Cult of the Lamb rolling in at 11 out of our 27 here.
1:01:19
Let's I'll try to.
Power through these as as fast as I can here.
We do have been putting this off for a little while, but our our fan letters coming in off of our Shattered Pixel Dungeon episode that we got a while back.
1:01:36
I did want to to carve out some time to to to talk to them because we did have a lot of a lot of feedback from that episode.
So our first letter is from.
Devin Devin I'm the actual lead dev of Shattered Pixel Dungeon.
1:01:53
The first time a developer has thought our podcast worthwhile enough to write in says Hey Grog Pod.
I listened to your podcast episode recently.
Thanks for taking the time to try Shattered Pixel Dungeon.
I wanted to make a few questions comments about some of the things you guys mentioned in the podcast.
1:02:12
As some of you said, a lot of the feedback I get is from the perspective of players who are experienced with Pixel Dungeon or traditional Rogue likes in general.
So a truly outside perspective is quite valuable.
Shattered is meant to be a more approachable in comparison to other rogue likes, so appealing to new players is something that I want to do.
1:02:28
These are the four main things I wanted to mention regarding tutorialization.
I noticed none of you mentioned the very short guided tutorial at the start of the game or the guidebook that is that this tutorial points you towards.
Was this something that you all skipped over, or were they not very helpful?
1:02:43
The guidebook in particular is meant to be a reference that replaces a longer guided tutorial, as a lot of players don't appreciate having to do a tutorial for more than half a minute or so.
Agreed on that part at least.
Point #2, At least one of you limited that there was no story of the game.
1:02:59
I do fully admit that the heroes in particular have almost no story currently.
This is something that I plan to improve, but the dungeon itself does have quite a bit of descriptive story Slash lore text.
Did you notice?
Just that the text or did you or did you notice that text or did you feel like it wasn't really communicating the story?
1:03:17
The criticism of quote, no motivation to find the amulet is meant to be addressed by those texts.
I'll be in a more general sense regarding decision making.
I think this is a pretty fair criticism of the game.
There is a lot going on and it generally a run is made-up of a huge pile of little decisions rather than a small number of bigger ones.
1:03:36
It's worth noting that as you become more experienced in the game, those little decisions start to be more and more clear, but I absolutely agree it does not feel that way at the start.
Lastly, regarding meta progression elements, this one's pretty simple.
If I added them, I would be changing the genre of the game.
Shattered is meant to be a proper traditional rogue like, not a rogue light.
1:03:54
As Binding of Isaac, Darkest Dungeon, one or two, etcetera.
I know the genre difference is not always apparent to newcomers though, and so it often ends up feeling like Shattered just doesn't have a fun feature that is present in a lot of other similar games.
I do try to alleviate this a bit by having some, by having meta progression that isn't gameplay impacting though, such as finding Lortex or unlocking new heroes, all of which are pretty easy to unlock.
1:04:17
I don't want to take too much of your time, but if you have any thoughts regarding these points, I'd be happy to hear it Best, Evan.
Yeah.
Once again, thank you, Evan for writing into our lowly program for someone to take time out of their busy schedule, something we always appreciate.
1:04:34
You know, that whole thing I was not expecting.
I mean, I timed it out a couple times.
I'm like.
And it's from the actual dev.
I think that gives it a little bit more weight.
Also, I think he makes pretty fair critiques of our critique.
Sure.
So the tutorialization I like.
1:04:51
So we got this e-mail a while back.
I I went and reopened it up and like did I just like totally skip the tutorial and upon reopening the app I was like furiously trying to figure out like okay, I know it's in here somewhere.
I seem to recall like this hidden memory of like doing a kind of tutorial and I just first, I don't know if it's either my phone that I have.
1:05:14
This is probably one thing like I set all of my apps to never auto update.
Because I hate when like a new update comes out and just screws up my podcast app or something.
But like I couldn't find the tutorial, I barely remember going through it at the beginning.
1:05:31
I think like the little guide book in the upper right.
Once I knew that, like that was a resource that I could lean on, it became helpful.
But it didn't seem like being able to revisit the tutorial once I had gone through it.
It was something that was super easily accessible.
Yeah, I'm looking at it on my phone right now and I don't actually see how to get to a tutorial.
1:05:53
You just enter the dungeon, you choose your hero, you go into the dungeon.
I think.
So our I know that at least two of us had the problem of not understanding how the investigate tool worked, which was a huge source.
1:06:10
I I didn't realize that.
Fully until we were doing the podcast and I think that was a huge, huge blow to my ability to understand what was going on at the game.
And granted, I don't think, I don't think any of us really put quite enough hours into the game to fully properly review it.
1:06:30
I.
Mean you were coming down with COVID at the time too, so.
I was coming down with COVID.
I'll I'll say that I was like in the beginning stages of Delirium as we're recording the podcast.
But it's not really an excuse for not playing it in the two weeks I had before so.
1:06:46
Yeah, I mean, I think there's an aspect of like how much like we're also like the three of us, not mobile first gamers and we deliberately went down the path of like playing this on a mobile interface just to see what would happen.
So there might be like an element of like.
1:07:03
We may have seen the tutorial and then we went back to YouTube or like Reddit or something, or actually not on Reddit, the mobile apps anymore RIP.
But you know, our attention divided and just like not remembering that at all versus like on desktop if we had the wiki open on another window.
1:07:21
Yeah, I deliberately tried not to use my computer or the wiki at all, because I wanted to be a what if I was playing this on a bus and like swapping back and forth?
Is not easy and they have the tutorial guide book, but I don't feel like it was.
I don't remember it being like quite fluid enough for me to understand, and I'm sure that these are things that you could just learn over time.
1:07:47
If we played it more, I'm sure that a lot of this stuff would become, yeah.
But it's gonna be fun for us.
It's gonna help.
Yeah.
I mean, like that's why we both are like and I think that one of the other concerns, 2 hours is how long I put into the game.
And like, I'm sorry, like if you're going to get me into the game, I I can't feel like a chore.
1:08:04
And so, like, I maybe I would have learned all this stuff, but my goodness.
But I I'm guessing you probably don't have your Lee Chess app open on your phone for more than 1015 minutes at a time anyway, right?
That's right.
I mean, I really don't even do that much on my phone these days and at all.
1:08:20
I mean like, basically there's no gaming at all that happens on my phone.
Well, when we cover our paper Rogue and pop light episodes, you're going to be burning through that phone battery, let me tell you.
Let's Pokémon Go.
That's the exception actually, just to point out like that.
I I was addicted to that for a long time, so or short while.
1:08:38
Let's yeah, so I think tutorial like if it was, if it was something I could easily revisit in like the guidebook, that might be helpful.
Just to remember like what the hell am I supposed to do?
Like and maybe like one or two more?
Kind of like medium level slash advanced.
Tactic stuff just to like sprinkle in like here's like some cool like high level stuff that you can do in the game to kind of like carrot my way along that.
1:09:03
Like if I had to make a request again open source, I could just put those in myself and you know pray for the PR to go through.
But let's jump to the story.
So.
Story I I definitely did see like the little notes scattered throughout the dungeon, but I didn't think those really had to do with my character at all.
1:09:22
I thought those were just like some other character that was going through the dungeon.
I think one note that you pick up is like, I've just started like guard duty in the city area or like or the prison zone and boy, I can't wait to see what happens and well, I guess we all know how that goes.
1:09:39
But like Rift Wizard, a game that basically your your story is.
Go and kill evil wizard like you boot that up and it's just like the first time you booted up has a like literally just a black screen Ms. Paint text on there that is strangely captivating because it's like you know, welcome you are a wizard.
1:10:00
Like welcome to the ruins of the universe or something like that.
I'm like okay tell me more like if there was like like it doesn't.
It doesn't need to be big or or really like.
High production value of just like, you know, hey, here's a dungeon.
1:10:19
There's like the sacred amulet at the bottom of it.
It's important because blah.
Oh OK, well like Dungeon's A Dreadmore, right?
Like where it's like, it is Dreadmore's you got to kill Dreadmore.
And like, that's, you know, bad, bad dude.
And again, like, we're maybe splitting hairs here.
1:10:34
We're like, you know some games don't need that element of deep story.
But but that was just my kind of thought on.
It was like something something like.
I didn't even know that the amulet of Gendor was in there like until I looked through the wiki and like if I had known that was in there as someone who has kind of like that tribal knowledge of these, you know, history of Rogue, like games, like OK, like that's my that's my goal.
1:10:59
But again kind of a kind of a minor point.
It is a bit odd though I mean like that then an amulet like I guess, I mean there is the, the one Ring to rule.
I mean like you can have jewelry as like the main quest item thing, but like when I think of something that's like truly epic, I think of the Triforce, I think of like you know these and a trinket is like a I mean maybe the IT.
1:11:19
All stems from the Cimarils.
It all stems from the Cimarils in whatever that first one was when they're trying to get the Cimarils of Lord of the Rings.
Cimarilian's Lore.
I remember.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're.
What's the?
1:11:35
What's the one that?
No, no.
The one of the early Rogue like games you're you're.
Trying to like, well, Rogue, the titular Rogue Your goal is to get the Amulet of or get the staff of Rodney or something.
But anyway, nerds, it's.
1:11:52
Not Maria I I think the the point I want to make here though is that show don't tell.
Walls of text as a way of communicating story in video games are bad.
And if if that's the medium that you have and that's who you want to work with, then you minimize.
1:12:16
Minimize, but like make it make sense.
Like give me like oh kill Dreadmore like okay.
Great.
Get to the top get to the kill the heart the slay the slay the Spire.
Okay, like simple goal like if you're not going to have.
A well known for its deep lower and I mean, it's not it's not super deep at all.
1:12:32
And you just you're left to wonder.
There's a lot of things that are like, you know, left to wonder like why is there this eternal whale?
Why does he keep bringing?
Me back.
You know, if I if I said that I cared about story in that podcast, I lied.
I don't care about story.
That's didn't bother me at all.
Last point this this might be its own like podcast episode and of itself.
1:12:53
If if he added meta progression elements, it would change the genre of the game from a traditional rogue like to a rogue of light.
I again like, I'm kind of out of my league here to debate with a game developer because I am not a game developer in the slightest.
But I don't think that this designation is explicitly true.
1:13:12
I don't think that like meta progression alone.
Again, like, I don't how much time we got.
We're an hour and 13 in.
We have time for another 4 hours, right?
So.
I think that we've been trying to figure out what we want to do for the one year thing and I think that we shouldn't play a game at all.
1:13:31
I think we should just try and figure out what a rogue like is because we haven't really talked about that.
And I think we've been dancing around it for like 8 months now of like what is the genre of games that we're reviewing?
Because most of them aren't at all like the game Rogue.
1:13:48
Like this is true traditional Rolex.
We have not played very many traditional rogue legs and.
Should be fair I think after having done this for 27 episodes now, I don't think I really like them, that no rogue lights or rogue like as as is described by.
Yeah, like, we're bad.
1:14:05
They're bad games.
I'm not going to say that.
They're they're not very good.
They're bad.
Okay Okay Okay so.
That's that's too strong.
That's too strong.
They're going to find you, Will.
I think they can sit on attack, all right.
I think they're not.
I think they're very specific genre of a larger.
1:14:21
Genre of games that is the one that I truly want this podcast to be about and to review and I think that it's the Rogue Light is even still not a great term and I I think that it'd be interesting to like spend a whole episode delving into like yeah what are the what are the things that make things a rogue like or rogue or like how how do you put.
1:14:49
A game like Shattered Pixel, Dungeon and Slavespire and Stacklands in one category, like what is the thing that that binds them together?
Because it's not herma death, it's not randomly generated dungeons like Stacklands is not.
1:15:07
Yeah, so.
Yeah.
So it's it's not, it's like I think I disagree with that point.
We'll revisit this at A at a later date.
But I think my my pithy statement is that all rogues are likes Rogue Light is not a thing and that they're they're like rogue likes now are a subgenre in that previously it was like traditional rogue likes are now rogue like dungeon crawlers and you have rogue like platformers.
1:15:38
Rogue.
Yeah.
Like, that's why we need a.
So we'll maybe do I disagree with both of you for the sake of disagreeing, just so that we can have it you.
Know but like Tales of Majel has meta progression, Hyper Rogue has meta progression.
There's plenty of traditional Rogue likes that have meta progression, but anyway, we'll revisit that another time.
1:15:53
We have a second e-mail to go over from our good friend.
Davian Fuxa is the correct pronunciation.
I watched the stream of his at the Fuxa plays on YouTube.
He says hey grog Pod kind of wish that you would put a little more time into playing Shattered Pixel Dungeon, but nonetheless a good episode and I can't say I disagree for where you ranked it.
1:16:14
Where I took time to play Shattered Pixel Dungeon myself, I was initially not interested in it as it felt like just another traditional rogue like with the fantasy theme.
I came back to to play this game in Ernest.
Effertine mentions that over and over by people suggesting.
For suggestions of mobile, Rogue likes to play.
1:16:31
My thoughts on the game is that it definitely is very entry is a very entry friendly rogue like.
While it while it is a lot of the complexity of a veteran of the genre would expect to be present here, it's still approachable enough for someone to be completely new to this style of game to pick up and play.
1:16:47
That said, I don't think it's necessary to be doing anything notable or different that helps, or set it apart from other traditional Rogue likes, either.
Outside of being made for mobile devices which isolates it from storefronts like Steam which suffer from a deluge of games tagged with rogue like or rogue light prefixes daily, I will know that when playing Shattered Pixel dungeon it wasn't so off put by the lack of a story of just being thrown in the dungeon from the get go.
1:17:09
This is very reminiscent of Diablo the first one which didn't waste my time by letting you select a character and or didn't waste time just letting you select a character and throwing you and you head first into the game.
There is a story, by the way.
If you play through enough, you'll start picking up journal entries we talked about regarding backgrounds of those adventures and denizens of this place and their accounts of what happened.
1:17:30
Also, your adventure is reason for delving into this dungeon simply to investigate what's going on below the settlement that the dungeon sits on.
In relation to this game being on mobile devices, I consider it decent enough in terms of content and ease of picking up.
It isn't.
It isn't so lacking in content that I play through it a couple times that I'm done with it yet.
1:17:46
It's so complicated that if I put it down and come and come back to it a day or two later.
And I'm left scratching my head as to what I was doing.
However, at the same time, this is also a game that after getting a few runs, I don't feel the need to come back to it on PC.
There isn't really any contest between this and other rogue like this one is quite inferior just to do just due to how much more work there is put into the dungeon crawl.
1:18:09
Stone soups, Jupiter hills, caves caves of cuds or whatnot.
At best this is only trying to the only thing this game has going for is perhaps it's simpler to play than a lot of those other traditional rogue likes.
Agreed.
But if someone was looking for an entry level type game on PC, there's still a lot of others to the titles to rattle off.
1:18:27
Figured I'd share these thoughts of someone with something to touch on as to follow up to last week's episode.
Cheers, Dave in Yeah, I think our we didn't really put a whole lot of time into it.
But I also don't want this podcast to feel like homework for my my cohost.
1:18:45
So if a game like doesn't initially grab us, I think that's okay.
Maybe it's maybe we're just having an off week.
Maybe we're coming down with COVID or had other stuff to do.
I think if a game does have that kind of like magnetic lightning moment, it will.
1:19:02
It will pull us out of whatever stupor that we're in and demand our attention of it, and it's okay for a game to not do that.
Maybe it will do that later on.
But yeah, I think for the few hours that we put in on desktop, at least, the 10th percentile of people who play Shattered Pixel Dungeon on Steam is like 6 hours, and the median play time is like 24 hours.
1:19:26
And the 90th percentile play time for Shattered Pixel Dungeon on Steam is 535 hours.
So it can get deep.
But again like if.
None of us are.
I mean, Scott, maybe you a little bit, but I don't play games on my phone ever.
1:19:43
I don't have a place where I would do that, that I don't also have my supremely superior dual screen large PC in front of me like well, I could play it on my phone that has it's the size of my hand or I could play it on a giant monitor with a keyboard and a mouse or a it's an inferior form factor.
1:20:04
So I haven't.
I don't have the ability to break this against.
On its own merits, really, I'm rating against other games that have far superior input technology.
If I spend a lot of time on a bus, if I was playing mobile games and other places, I think this would be a a better ranked game or or more a game that satisfied a need for me more.
1:20:32
And I kind of wanted Even even when we were doing that episode, I felt like it almost needed its own category of like, yeah, here it is, all games, but it's like probably a good mobile game.
It's probably good for playing on mobile.
Sure.
Yeah.
I mean, if we get another few mobile games under our build, maybe for end of end of calendar year shenanigans in the Super Bowl style tournament playoff thing I have in my head, maybe it'll make it a reappearance there.
1:21:02
But regarding.
Like inferior.
I don't know that I would say Shattered Pixel Dungeon is inferior to some other rogue likes.
I would possibly say it's it's better because I I did try to put in a few hours into Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and boy if there was ever a game that would be impossible to get you 2 to play and enjoy it would be this one that like maybe maybe me.
1:21:25
Just saying that is is enough of a challenge, but like the I own cages of CUD.
I mean yeah, like Case of Cud has its own very interesting aesthetic.
We haven't gotten to Jupiter Hell yet, but it's on the To Do List.
Pixel Dungeon I think is is great in that intro, streamlined experience.
1:21:45
Like I don't care about a randomized dungeon that's like 50 miles wide per se unless like you know, we're going for the theme there.
But I think it's it's maybe the best gateway drug to the traditional rogue like dungeon crawling genre.
That's and you can play it on a phone.
1:22:03
And you can play it on a phone.
I don't think you could do it for most other dungeon crawlers.
Well, not easily, at least.
Are are, Yeah, there's you can play Cataclysm dark Days ahead on a phone, believe it or not.
1:22:19
I have no idea why on earth you would do that.
But you can do that.
Yeah.
So I think like.
The feedback that we got from our Shattered Pixel dungeon was passionate.
I think partially it was my Mia culpa for posting that episode in the Pixel Dungeon Discord.
1:22:38
Be like hey everyone, we reviewed the game and then we just dumped on it for an hour and a half.
Get wrecked noobs.
But also, it sucks nobody blew their wig off when Will dumped on Cogmind.
So that's cuz he's wrong.
I'm pretty sure all the feedback I received was as reasonable.
1:22:55
That's reasonable.
That's reasonable.
But I know that's just my memory.
Maybe.
But Will is also our our Curb Your Enthusiasm character Larry David on the show.
So.
So I think he gets a pass on that one.
I I just want to say this, let's never do mobile games.
I just the phone is meant to play chess and that's it.
1:23:13
And and.
That's why you would I think you would really like like it's free.
You can download it right now.
Will hop light.
It's it's literally like chess night hopping puzzles, but with rogue like elements.
Rather than chess tactics.
1:23:30
Okay, that's.
I mean that's fair.
That's fair.
But Magic Survival, the precursor to Vampire Survivors, is a mobile game.
I think like I'm on a mission that we we could find something.
Slice and dice is also mobile.
There's stuff there that is good that we just haven't played yet, I think.
1:23:48
And I think I could convince you of that so.
All that said and done, winding down the episode.
Finally, if you want to, if you want to write in a lengthy e-mail to us and have it, have us.
Apparently we read those out in full.
1:24:04
I don't.
I mean, you know, I had thought about it, bridging it and putting a note in, but you know, I delayed it for so long.
Grog pod zone@gmail.com is the place to send your hate mail.
We're on Mastodon Grog pod at game dev dot plays.
Grog pod dot zone is the website which.
Da da da da.
1:24:20
Now you can find a fan request form on the contact us page.
Spam that with your suggestions for what we should play and we'll put it up as a as a fan request week into our schedule so that that are we.
1:24:37
On threads by the way.
Is what?
Are we on threads?
Yeah, Scott, are we on threads?
Yeah, you're our.
Social Media Manager here.
I mean, don't you wanna give?
How much do we value?
How much do we value our personal privacy Is the question.
