Okay.
Welcome to the Grog pod broglie podcast.
I'm your host, Scott Burger.
Today, we're going to be talking about darkest dungeons, to a dungeon game, diving deep into mental health and making sure people are invested in their interpersonal relationships.
0:58
And with me today, are my two co-hosts joining me as usual on this mental help.
Improvement and awareness simulator.
I'm callin a wretch being crushed by the wheels of a brutal and merciless world.
1:20
The better and this is will I'm just a maximum stressed out narrator who wanting to air grievances Well, with my dubious attempt at a Sam Harris.
I don't know what it's like.
1:39
When you're listening to The Grog pod.
Same here as podcast.
Crock pot in the morning.
Yeah, you'd have to say something about housekeeping and something along those lines that we didn't want to operate.
Yeah, I didn't want to outright steal his intro music and get blocked off.
1:56
Apple podcast for good, but But yes, this this week we're talking darkest dungeons to our most fresh out of the box game that we've reviewed thus far.
I did the math so far on average.
We've been covering games that are about 7 years old.
2:14
I mean we haven't really covered that many yet but this is darkest dungeon 2 is only come out as of recording right now 29 days ago.
And I think that's I think we'll just get into it.
Is very fresh out of the box, darkest dungeons to platform wise.
2:34
You can find it on the epic game, store Steam.
And that's it for now.
Presumably console versions are coming darkest dungeon one, the previous entry in his franchise.
2:49
Also came out on basically everything Xbox PlayStation switch.
I can only imagine that this game will come to those at some point but hope it doesn't.
We're 29 days in hot off the heels of technical to, okay?
3:04
Technically, the steam release is 29 days ago.
Dark extensions to did come out in Early Access on the epic games.
Epic game store like a year ago, but because that's a marketing black hole.
No one actually knew about it until just now dark extensions to developed and published by Red Hook Studios.
3:25
Most well-known and only well known for their only other game that they've produced darkest dungeon is one back in 2016.
Darkus sentence, two poles in I'd fresh numbers, right?
Off of The steam API this morning in a frantic rush for me to update the data set.
3:43
DD two rolls in at number 98, on the entire genre of roguelike games with 8,000, 18 thousand, thirteen total reviews.
Well, I think it's pretty clear that you've reached Peak stress at this moment.
4:02
Are you going to have a meltdown toxic or Resolute?
One sentence description of what one does in darkness meltdown meltdown?
Yeah, despite yet despite the, okay, in the one sentence or, you know, approximately one, despite this being the freshest game, we've played it, definitely smells the most rotten it.
4:22
The, the long story short here is it's like the first one which is a A tactical.
Interesting plot developing good use of game mechanics game, but then they decided to just Infuse it with shit and just not just like a little bit but everywhere just stuff the shit in and just until it's at capacity and then stuff, it some more with more game mechanics and more terrible ideas that just don't work.
4:49
And some time you got out of the, the sluice level or you still still in it, are you recording from the sluice right now, or I don't even remember what the there were so many names for the different stupid things.
I don't even if that is that a thing that's in the game.
That's the one with the Pigman.
Pop and Jerry.
5:06
Yeah, but yeah.
So dark is dungeons to I think.
Okay.
So maybe to preface this angry tirade of a podcast.
I think to to good rules to have here.
Our number one.
5:22
It's okay to like or not like a game and number two good.
That's Good thing.
All developers, go to heaven, all Deb's, go to heaven, and it's okay to like, or not like a game.
I think those those are two good ground rules to start because I think this this might be a little bit.
5:38
I think there might be a little bit of contention.
Here, our Story begins with darkest dungeon to wear ruin.
Has found you at last a zombie.
I get question.
Mark.
Professor busts open a wall to find you and say they were ephemeral.
5:57
Equation is unbalanced of maybe I need more Shatner voice in there, but and that I guess the, the Doomsday apocalypse has come to to the world and you've been tasked by Undead Professor zombieman to take a little bit of a flame of Hope out into the world and face what lurks out in the mountain.
6:23
And I guess what lurks in there is the darkest dungeon, which we'll get to in a minute.
Minute.
But that's that's what kicks us off here.
What was I guess?
Like also this game being darkest dungeon to it's all in and II think came to this with darkest dungeon zero experience.
6:44
I yeah, actually.
I was going to ask you the same question so I just looked I put two and a half hours into the first one.
So and I like what?
Maybe like an hour or two into the first one just says, like a curiosity of like, okay, I got this on like super, super steep discount on Steam.
7:03
Like, what's this all about is for sure.
A stay tuned for this podcast.
Absolutely.
But like, okay, well, you know, I've got 20 minutes to kill.
Let's pop it open and see what that's like.
Okay, yeah this is, this is different.
Let's go back to the other game.
We were playing for this week but will you have considerably more experience but darkest engines one?
7:23
Yeah.
That's why I wanted this darkest dungeon to, I was like, oh so so excited for this one to come out and I was I was really looking forward to.
I think I had 75 hours in the first one and I gave it a 7 point 5 rating, which is, you know, above my above the recommendation threshold of 6.
7:39
So it was like, okay, that's it was a good game that he did everything right, but like they definitely it was a well put together.
I mean, I felt like the narrative worked the, the sort of game mechanics.
They tied together everything kind of fit and it wasn't Like perfect for me, but I really enjoyed the first one I have.
7:59
I know a lot of people who really like darkest dungeon one including Joe our guest from last week who I Jo Jo and also almost certain listener who really like this game or sorry.
Really likes darkest dungeon one and was super excited for darkest dungeon to to come out.
8:19
Yeah I think I think he's the reason that I played the first one at all.
Yeah, I would be I think a lot of people were probably super pumped for darkest dungeon too because they were big fans of darkest.
Dungeons one.
8:36
I think, like, I'm hesitant to have this be like a comparison podcast episode because I think there's like an interesting element of Colin, and I coming to this game Brash and will come into this game with kind of his emotional gameplay baggage from the first one.
8:54
And yeah, I think, like, right off the bat, like, you know, the the art style for the first one, very like Inky black.
I don't know if cartoon, he's the right word, but like, very, and there were cartoons, it's like, like those, this is killing me.
9:15
Those like graphic novels that just have like, really heavy, like ink lines on them.
I don't know how to describe it like a Sin City kind of a thing.
Yeah, it's it's yeah, it's interesting because Like I'm comparing it to something like the clay games Griff lands or don't starve or whatever where it's got those like very thick lines.
9:43
It's like a stylized thick line animation where like the black of the lines is very emphasized but where I don't like the clay animation.
I actually do really like the animation of that like the 2D animation from both of the darkest dungeon games like It's its stylized without being cartoonish.
10:04
Like like, I don't know, childishly cartoon.
Yeah.
Childish is not something that would be on mobile game at the, you know.
That's, that's the big difference here.
I think.
Yeah.
And I think that like, like we're getting a lot of Whiplash from our previous episode, monster train to here for multiple reasons.
10:26
One.
I think is like the wildly different art style, but wildly different gameplay just like everything, the So just like the pace of game play just like how everything looks music.
It's like everything that you could think of being different for me.
10:44
This was this was like slamming into a brick wall slow most compared to monster train.
Yeah, absolutely.
I just think that the real comparison for me is going to be between monster training this because I, I've been playing my type.
I was playing Master training right before this podcast.
11:00
I'm actually I bumped it up to number two in my My rankings because I've been playing it for the past two weeks.
Like, oh no, I really like this game and then you hit this and you're like, oh this is a, it's a different design Philosophy for sure.
Yes.
Very different.
But it does start off with one thing that that is in Wills favorite game of all time.
11:23
And therefore, this is also Wills favorite game show.
The Overworld is.
Yeah, the slay, the spires style FTL style, like multi-branch selection like After choosing.
Yeah.
Big.
They did that.
Yes.
One part of the equation.
Yeah.
11:38
Yeah.
And that's all you need.
That's all you need to really make a 10 out of 10 will game as we all know.
But yeah.
The difference the difference is here for darkest dungeon to I almost I didn't have like several God.
How many pages of notes do I?
Have ten pages of my Google doc of notes here?
11:55
Because I wanted to be as thorough as I could for a game that I think a lot of people have high expectations for and There's a lot to unpack, but I feel like one of the major not failings of this game, but something that kind of rug pulls a little bit, is the number 2 or the II in the title.
12:17
We're like this is clearly in the darkest dungeons Universe.
It plays pretty similar to the first one but with this be like better titled as like darkest dungeon is t 0 or like darkest dungeons, as well as opposed to like, Is the sequel to the first 100?
12:36
I'm here.
Well, I wouldn't be the right one day, even though I played the first one, all the way through to the end, and I don't remember the story.
I just remember that it felt coherence.
And this one is just another crazy sort of like the background.
Oh, there's zombies.
There's things coming out.
Okay.
And we're to cart.
12:52
Okay, yeah, that's the basic difference, but I think the last one was it.
There was like a there was actually a dungeon, which is.
Oh yeah.
So darkest old a dungeon and darkest dungeon.
Okay, that makes a little bit more sense than When you are not on a dungeon in this Overworld, but I've been, I had to make a note, in my Google doc, with a lunch lady.
13:12
Doris impression saying, there's very little dungeon in this darkest of like, I guess.
Let's so, I guess, you know, technically, there are dungeons to some degree but you're not like, Exploring like the dungeon isn't like the de facto thing that you're diving into where that was kind of like the Cornerstone.
13:31
The first one.
The Cornerstone of this one is I think maybe its weakest part and that is the wagon.
Yes, the wagon is Terror.
I mean, okay, go ahead, I'll let you know.
Yeah, this little place to start though because yeah, okay, so we're all the wagon and all the mechanics to go into like the decisions around where you want to go, is like foundational to this kind of game and I'm curious to get your thoughts on why you He was done so well.
13:57
Well, okay, so there's I think at the top, I don't hate this game.
I think this was another game where I had a really hard time ranking ranking game.
We'll get to that at the end here is like you, but like I was bouncing back and forth all over the place.
14:15
And I'm like, man, you know, if this game just feels too early, right?
And I feel like the, the aspect that feels, the clunkiest is like the core part, where you are.
So you assemble your party of friends at the Out of this game, you emerge from the abyss, like the art Style, the music, the animations, everything super well done you arrived in this wooden horse drawn cart and you set off.
14:43
Okay, great.
Your adventure has begun into the mandatory tutorial zone for every run, which I kind of like, that makes sense as like a first player experience introduction.
Even though I kind of like, got cracked over the head a few times, I'm like, what is going on here?
15:00
What am I missing?
But what like Cycle through it.
A few times.
You start to get the pattern, you get into the tutorial Zone and you're just going basically in a straight line to the end and you do that by doing this Stagecoach driving sequence where you it's all 3D rendered which seems Superfluous question mark.
15:25
Yep, absolutely.
And there's there's like little piles of debris on the road.
That this took me forever to figure out, like, do I avoid these things or do I run into these things?
Because there's a big gameplay, mechanic of you have to maintain your cards, like wheel health and like armor health and, you know, depending on what branch you select and later acts, you know, you'll take like wheel damage or armor damage that kind of thing.
15:56
But I'm seeing these little piles of leaves on the ground like, okay, well, do I avoid it?
Like, okay, this run, I'm just going to run into everything and see what happens.
Oh, I get little items.
Okay, that wasn't super clear at the start but I guess I'll do that now.
And then after a while it's like, well, like do I really need to like be focused on this whole segment of going from like location to location like an FTL, right?
16:20
You have your little spaceship, you're at node a and you want to go to node B, you click it, and then the guy goes there, that's it.
That's all you need in darkest dungeon to it's like Imagining the spaceship Keep doing a this'll sound way, more exciting than it actually is, but like a Star Fox style sequence of like on Rails.
16:40
Like oh you could swing to the side, your could swing to that side, but it doesn't, it doesn't feel necessary and it seems like I'm kind of like, railing a lot on this thing.
It's like Aaron doesn't seem like a big deal, but it chugs really bad.
I don't know if you guys have beefier computers and I do, I've only had a puny GTX 970.
16:59
My desktop.
I know I'm living in the Past year.
But, but it was, it was crunching down to, like 20 frames per second pretty consistently.
During these segments, Yeah, I didn't I didn't have that issue, but I mean, I didn't have that issue by issue is entirely with the with the trudging down of the path where you had to drive a wagon like a bad minigame, uh nabad, unskipable mini game with little reward.
17:36
That you had to do every between every fight.
I wasn't even a familiar with, like anything good coming out of hitting anything.
I said I was far as I was under the impression of like you just hands free weights and if you don't do anything, it's the same thing and you're just yeah, there's a tool type of says you can get stuff from hitting bushes, or whatever.
17:57
The, what's interesting, you would think that you'd want to avoid the things because you have wheel health and you have armor health and so none of that.
None of that is a coherent story.
Around what you should be doing, then like oh, hit the things but also your wheels might get damaged but not from this like what?
18:14
And also the likes of you on, it is like extremely difficult to like see what's going on.
So like the camera angle, you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like the camera angle and you're flying through like a like 2.5 D rendering where.
18:31
It's like I guess it's probably fully 3D but its stylized and It makes it look like it's supposed to be 2D but you know, you're like twisting and turning and going up and down.
I will, I will like this is going to be a pull that no one gets but maybe Woody if he's listening, West 64, I think is the game.
18:58
Okay.
Yeah.
A terrible game for the N64 that my mom bought for me.
Bless her heart.
She thought it Cohen's Mommy.
We know you're listening, but it wasn't a good game.
And I for some reason, like the sequence reminded me of that, where it's just like, I don't know, random polygons of going up and down with like shit on the side.
19:22
That's as interesting as it was.
Yeah, but it's part of like the decision-making process where you're looking at this over were that the yet Overworld map and like, along all the way you see, all these little Pathways where, you know, if I go this pathway then I'm going to take wheel damage or I'm going to take our more damage.
19:42
Yeah.
But you're not making that decision the men's while you're going down the pathway.
No, no.
But it's like you eventually you no matter what you would hit the thing that would cause the wheel damage or you'd hit the thing that caused the armor damage.
It's funny because it's like the same mechanic they decided decided Locate and did two different currencies of Health essentially and with the laments being like this other thing that progresses as well.
20:02
And it's just like they just this is kind of like kind of all ties into my meta gripe here which is that they just took all these game mechanics and just stuff them into the game.
Like they just kept stuffing and stuffing to the gills where for the first time experience.
20:18
Like there are the introduced about 100 mechanics in the first like time you go through like, including in addition to The the wheel armor and and the wagon health and laments, there's like characters have their own like all the, all your four characters, they all have specific map objectives.
20:34
The like, oh, you have to go to hospitals.
Oh, I need to go to the low.
Yeah, meet you don't like ask you but you do.
Yeah, you kind of do because they also have interpersonal relationships.
You have to loose their relationships.
You make sure they're happy and if you don't make sure they're happy.
Then you can't use certain moves because they're like, oh, I'm jealous that Joe Bob has the The one move that he's good at.
20:57
So every time you use it our relationship is going to go down and then I'm going to be blinded with jealousy, I guess.
Yeah, I mean that's another like big I mean I want to get into that but like the overall this all these is like in other games which I won't mention.
21:12
But even though we know we're talking about spiders, like there's a there's a there's a boss function away the decision-making sort of like set of parameters, where you look at like the decisions in front of you and you're able to like, look not just at this decision.
I like one ahead and say, oh I should fight a really big boss because I need a big reward and I've got a lot of health and there's like a health thing after it.
21:31
Oh, great.
That's like, you know, you have to think like, two moves ahead.
Since I started thinking about like, paths in this case, you have to, like, add up.
Okay, what's my wagons condition with all these things?
Whatever.
Where do I need to go in the long run?
We're how do I need to?
Like, what?
There's just like a thousand things that are all competing for your needs and while that might sound like, it makes it no more complex and fun.
21:51
No.
It turns out that then you just feel like you're kind of waffling between Just because they all represent you know a local pecan like your decision-making like landscape and so it's like, well yeah this peak looks just as good as that one, as far as I can tell and it's just like it's not a fun thing to feel like this is a decision.
22:11
Okay, I guess I made it was this the same kind of style as darkest dungeon one?
No, not at all.
It's the darkest dungeon one.
And I'll have to, hopefully, I'm misremembering and mixing it up with another game because it's been several years, but like, I'm pretty sure.
Sure is a situation where we still automat automatically going between different points, like you choose a node, essentially, in a dungeon and then that you would see like them all traveling together as your light slowly gets dimmer.
22:37
And like, occasionally there would be random events that would like pop up on the middle of the way but essentially just kind of going a to be and sometimes I believe there was backtracking was an element and so that it wasn't always moving ahead and backtracking is one of those things that you typically want to avoid.
But it worked really well because it's like, oh, I want to go to this room.
22:55
I know if I go there, then my candle will be down low enough where you have to take a risk.
We're like if I go there and I don't get more like light for my torture, whatever it was in the first game that I might run out and then that makes things super hard.
And so there was a lot more strategy that went into the decision.
Making that was like obvious, but like where you knew?
23:12
What risks you were taking and where it felt a lot more?
Satisfying, well, and so, in the first game you had your candle or porch or whatever where your are in a literal dark dungeon and your candle is burning down.
Down and you have to get to the end or the objectives, or whatever, before your candle runs out in this, it's like there's a torch on Your Wagon.
23:33
Why?
Well, because Professor make sure the professor Z has given it to you, right?
But it works thematically with the first game and with the second game is just a, it could be literally anything.
It could be like a dude in the back who's bleeding out, it could be a death plant that's growing.
23:53
It will explode and destroy the the world when you're done like you hat.
It has absolutely no connection to the theme of the game.
You're above the ground.
You are presumably in.
I mean I guess it's very dark looking right?
24:10
Go, probably during the day that would save them.
A lot of trouble just travel during the day.
Really.
And like I don't really feel like I had a good sense of what the world like it was just kind of like your start off and you're like traveling through like weird Misty Blackness and It just felt untethered from anything.
24:32
Like, I didn't feel like I was in a place.
In some ways almost reminded me of like, Loop hero where you're in, like a vague land, where nothing around it, likes to exist anymore.
But that's absolutely not what this game was trying to be like you are supposedly in a place but yeah, I didn't get to it at all and it definitely feels like will was kind of alluding to this of like a bunch of different systems Mash together under the theme of the darkest dungeon the universe.
25:06
So in this darkest dungeons as well.
Game actually hang on.
You know what it is.
I'm gonna grab it for audio purpose, sake of a podcast, audio visual partying it's this.
It is step in feld's castles of burgundy in roguelike setting with all sorts of like like bamboozling tokens and systems.
25:28
Are interconnected with each other and a theme that seems like somewhat.
Like, I don't know, kind of disconnected from the gameplay mechanics but Once you grok it, and this is where I think I kind of split from the field here.
25:45
It I think I'm the light is starting to turn on, for me of like, okay, think I'm starting to get it.
I think I'm starting to understand how all these systems are interlinked where, yeah, it is annoying to have, like your characters.
26:00
All of a sudden be like, well, if you want to use this ability, it's going to Blind your other, dude.
But that makes I think, for an interesting gameplay, decision of well.
Do I in combat?
Do I really want to use this thing?
Because like it might have an adverse effect on my character or like going about the steps to mitigate that relationship from happening.
26:24
So we kind of talked about you know your wagon inning through the tutorials own, the valley fighting zombies.
You come to an inn and that's where you have kind of like a checkpoint period where you can.
Again this took me like way too long to figure out six only 16 hours into the game but like it's taken me this long to kind of like Get The systems now are like okay.
26:46
I think I finally got it all of the all the Sheep tokens and all the little wooden cubes or certain to get a for me here, where you have combat items, you have items for the in you've items for Your Wagon.
27:02
Like the more that I was interfacing with us more I'm like okay this this is just seeming like a complicated European board game in roguelike format.
Okay.
I think like with that mindset, this is starting to fall into place.
Using those in items, you can help to manage your character stress.
27:20
Keep people from freaking out, keeping them, keeping them nice and loose and nice and relaxed.
You're listening to The Grog pod and you are nice and relax your muscles.
That's what this game was.
This is the random freak out in the middle of a nice soothing in Yeah, I think.
27:44
The disjointedness of the of the biomes I'm conflicted on because like I another thing that again took me way too long.
The game did not do a very good job of explaining it the first time that you play the game you're on like act 1 out of 5 and it is it's the act of doubt and that kind of determines the boss that you fight at the at the end of the run, in order to do that, you go through your tutorials own.
28:13
Then you have an option to pick between the tangle, which is a haunted forest of plant Thorn enemies or the sprawl, which is a very on fire, kind of medieval castle Hamlet, filled with Bandits and people who will slice you up real good.
28:36
I thought the art for these were great.
I thought like, you know, the wagon segment.
Well, tedious That kind of going through the 3D environment seeing like the vines kind of come down, if it was like like almost anything else, it would be really cool like utilize the 3D environment or something.
28:55
I don't know.
You go through like those two environments and then you're able to go to the mountain even even though the tooltip says that you need a trophy in order to do so and I'm like what the hell's a trophy?
You get to the mountain and then you get your ass beat, it's almost unavoidable.
29:15
And then you do it all again, and you do it two or three more times with different characters and by the time that you beat that first boss, you're like, okay, that's the real tutorial Zone.
I think I've finally made it out of the main tutorial of the game and then that's when the other biomes unlock of the Shroud which is a bunch of like weird fish people.
29:38
You have the Fetter, which are Weird like tooth monsters, human mutants.
And then you have the sluice which half pig half men, what more can we say?
29:56
But none of these are really kind of Thematically connected to each other.
It's not like in FTL where you have like different sectors of like, okay, I'm going to choose this branch of the Overworld because I'm going to go like, focus on finding like Mantis.
30:15
And then, like, engineer people and like, the interconnectedness of it seems, I don't know.
They could almost could have been anything really, which kind of like the monster trains like different different classes or whatever, you know, with the benefit?
30:30
The Umbra, the the, the fish people of Hell, the fish people of hell.
Oh yeah.
That's none of it.
Yeah, exactly.
It's in there somewhere.
But yeah, I think like the The character selection here.
Is interesting.
30:47
I think one of the things that Rightfully question, mark, people are pretty mad at, is that dark extensions to launching $40, which already puts it into maybe like the top 99 percent of roguelike game pricing territory.
31:05
Is, is three-dimensional, there's a lot more animation involved.
I think all of us, can, you know, come to an agreement that game to Game Dev is hard, moving from 2D to 3D is exponentially more hard but you you start with four characters available out of 16.
31:24
We're in darkest engines one, you had 30 to pick from and maybe I don't know.
Like again I don't have the baggage from playing darkest dungeon one where I'm like man who would really Would be good to have that Sharpshooter guy in this game or the guy with the the dog who I guess people would really like I feel like the cast of characters here works.
31:46
Well, the P the for kind of characters you start with at the start like Work.
Well, once you unlock things, but I think you're deliberately set up for failure right at the start because like, there's not a hole.
It's not obvious how the synergies work?
32:05
At least for me tigers and that experience.
Well.
Okay, so I'll just be honest here.
I played five hours is game and I'm done with it.
I don't want to clean it or almost exactly.
Like I'm I unlocked exactly two characters and I don't, I don't know if there's synergies because I don't want to play it anymore.
32:24
Well II, you were saying that beating the First Act felt like the real tutorial to you and that might If that's true, that's a failing of the game because it's a lot.
It's a lot to be thrown at you and a lot of it is like there are four kinds of damage over time.
32:49
It's basically like if they had poison but also like four kinds of poison.
Hmm.
There's actual poison, there's burning bleed.
There's bleed they Got it all.
It's got all the different kinds of art.
It's like, it took like each individual mechanic is a good mechanic, and they're like, but what?
33:07
If there were three of that same mechanic in this game and Like 30 characters for 16.
I don't know.
I only saw six of them because like, it did not hook me enough to get through to grind through because I don't, I didn't have fun playing it.
33:32
It made me upset and It like the best comparison.
I have is a board game.
It's Twilight Struggle with Scott, and I have played where as you're playing.
It feels like you're trying to lose less.
33:49
But in Twilight Struggle, you're playing.
It's another human who's also feeling that same thing.
So you're like, well, this feels like I'm scrambling trying to stay alive, but I know Scott is to when you're playing this game.
You're like, this is an unthinking computer, it's not feeling that way.
34:05
I'm just like Trying not to lose trying to like, oh whoops, no I forgot.
Oh here, you know, I was really hoping for crit here, but 10% like, well, I guess I'll just roll the dice.
Like there's so many dice rolling mechanics in it where it's just like it's a 10%, it's 20%.
34:25
It's a coin flip where I did not, I never felt like I was in control of the game and maybe if I played it for three times more hours than I did, I I start to feel like I understood or had control. but like, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to put in half a work week, just to learn If I like a game, mmm, eventually when I know I don't like it right now.
34:54
Yeah, it is very much that kind of like hard pivot like crash into a brick wall.
Whiplash of monster train were like everything is laid out in front of you all.
The math is done for you.
You know, exactly what the monsters are going to do.
35:09
You know what they're going to do to your units.
And then like, it's all laid out in front of you and you're like, okay, I have a puzzle in front of me.
And how what Can I think of in order to to strategize around this and I think like, from, like Dev interviews that I've listened to, with the, the people develop darkest dungeons?
35:29
It seems like their goal is is exactly to like beat you down in order to build you back up again.
And I it's like conscious design decision.
It doesn't work for everybody clearly.
35:47
I don't know that it needs to And I think that, like, if, if I'll be curious to get Wills assessment of this, because I think darkest my assumption as someone who'd never really played Artisans one, is that that kind of theme is still there in the first one of like hey like welcome, welcome to darkest dungeons one.
36:07
Like you're gonna get your ass beat and you know you're gonna you're here to get a pounding and your goal is to survive the pounding kind of almost like in the Dark Souls way.
Right of like the game is going to go out of its way to be unfair and mean to you and your real victories like the moral victory of getting around it.
36:27
Well then like sense in their decision one I felt like and this is a while ago so I might be misremembering but having put 75 hours into the game.
There was something it in the beginning that kept me playing and so it was much easier for me to get into it, which is to say that, like, I could understand the synergies early enough.
36:48
I Could understand the decisions and like what was important?
I could understand.
Like when I was selecting like, where to go, oh, I should actually modify where I'm going based on the characters.
I have.
You has some of my characters are good at fighting this type of monster and all that stuff, like made sense like really fast.
And it was intuitive.
Whereas in this game with like all these characters and all the unlocks and unlocks mind, you that are hidden behind like the back character.
37:12
Unlike backstories, you have to like only slowly get through in the game so you don't even know what your characters are capable of.
Really like in terms of like the long-term and so as you're building them up, you might be having a like a terrible like crew of dudes and not know until you've gone on several steps down that.
37:28
Oh, like, even if I'm choosing the right skills here, like I really want to be building like w on bleed, or I want to do lots on the the poison stuff and like, oh, these two don't ever actually like lineup.
And so, that's kind of like, one of the things that I think, gives to what Colin was saying is that like, yeah, like I did do I unlock other characters?
37:46
Just say that I did.
But like, in order for me to lie, Like go through and do it play once with each of them, which is this, a to unlock nothing?
It would have taken me many, many runs.
And that kind of, like, comes back to this whole thing where this game just takes way too long.
38:01
I'm I don't have the exact numbers on the average runtime but a darkest dungeons, one run, I think was like 30 minutes or something like that.
And I would this game I think I cuz I did beat the whatever the act one or whatever, like it felt like it was like an hour and a half two hours.
38:17
Is that is that about II did some timings for this?
Yeah, your standard kind of normal battle encounter.
I timed out on average of like, three to five ish minutes which like At first again like coming out of monster.
Train was like like literally just like, oh my God.
38:35
This is like I'm waiting through molasses here.
This is like so tediously slow.
I think.
Like, At first I was just like, oh my God, I hate that.
I have to watch like all the animations.
I have to like, wait for all the enemies too.
Do their thing.
Just just get to it.
Where's my monster?
38:51
Train turbo Latin Dan it.
But like, okay.
So like three to five minutes for like your standard battle encounter.
I think in most acts, if not, all of them, you'll encounter these like Abyssal like mini-boss dudes, who are like these Eldridge horror guys, I'm either all out that the cult to some degree.
39:13
Yeah, the cultist.
That's right.
And like those battles I think for me.
The first few times I did them took like closer to like, 10 minutes each and.
Yeah, because they have a lot of healing.
They have a lot of healing, they run.
They typically have what one or two really beefy damage dealer guys.
39:31
And it's, it's like the first few times you encounter your like Jesus.
This is like impossibly hard.
Like what do you are you what are you expecting of Me game?
But like, as you like, Slowly unlock things in the game and you know, you find it, you're like you're slowly figuring out the system's.
39:53
You're like, okay.
Now I know kind of what to expect with these cultist encounters.
Now, I know roughly like, how the synergies of the different characters operate like, yeah, I can, I can kind of rag doll them around in like 3 to 5 minutes now, but it took a long time to get there and it was like Distinctly unfun to lose the them the first few times.
40:14
So are you better now at like, playing the game or do you have you just like ground out more unlocks and your characters are better?
I think, I think both, I think I'm better at understanding the almost deliberately obtuse.
40:31
I Grinnell Griffey.
That's in the battle sequences where again like monster train monster train slay, the Spire these Griff lands even that we just recently And we played all do tooltips exceedingly.
Well like you see a symbol on the screen you Mouse over it.
40:48
It's probably important to note that this game doesn't have controller support yet.
God help you for like you know, how you would get a controller to Mouse.
Over is all these icons in here, but in theory like those games, you're like what is this symbol?
Mouse-over.
Oh okay.
This is what it means, this is what it does.
41:05
That's great kind of hold control, which are a different strains of the thing over the whole screen is like, okay, what symbol am I looking for?
I don't know.
Let's look a little among these 42 symbols and leave which the very similar.
Memorize what some of your Looking for then like scan across it and be like, oh wait.
41:25
No, it's not here.
It wasn't there.
That was the problem.
Like, half the symbols just weren't in there.
They were like really simple.
So, again, there's two types of symbols are the ones on the top that like, you know, we were talking about earlier, do the kind of, like, like damage over time, they're like Buffs and like defensive things and then, like, the things on the bottom that are like, kind of Similar.
41:51
But slightly different and have like similar coloring and symbology.
And like again, like it's not ideal ifs here.
This is Ft.
R gaming design, right there, I don't know that it's not ft R, it is not after because I think there's there are worse.
42:07
There are games that had that we have played that do the UI much worse than this game, because once I was able to get it, Like, it took a while to get there and it's still not perfect, but I still think it's like, leagues better than again.
42:23
I'll Deb's go to heaven.
It's okay to not like, you're not like a game didn't curse.
I think has an abysmally bad you.
I wear.
Like, it's just, like, not not as good but like, yeah, but Indians curse, I wasn't.
42:42
If I got the iconography wrong, I wasn't going to lose a running immediately because of it, like, if you like, oh, there's the dude who's drumming, who's making this thing happens?
Like, well, if I don't, if I ignore that, then I will lose this turn more next turn.
43:03
Like this game is extremely like it is a puzzle.
It is.
You have to play it, right?
And so you have to know what those symbols are.
You have to know what it's going to happen to you because if you don't, your people will die.
43:23
I'm going to retroactively pretend I didn't say didn't scurs.
And what I meant to say was a valley without wind was much worse.
In terms of its you, I didn't first again, still fun game.
I like, gladly, go back to it and like, Smash Monsters for up at most 5 minutes, like a valley without wind, like Just this kind of like, 2001 A Space, Odyssey of, like, colors flying at you of just like, what?
43:45
Like I, there's, I don't think there's any human way to describe What's Happening Here, dark.
That was like Lou.
Yeah, that was our worst rated game wasn't or something new.
It's one of them Realm of the Mad.
God is still the, the bottom.
Oh, no.
It's a valley with that.
44:02
Wind is my personal last ranked well, so like yeah, no wonder.
Yeah, of course.
It's a double darkest dungeon to a forty dollar game with a like, every I have just put, I well.
Okay, I'll talk about this later in our Valley without wind Deep dive segment for later in the episode.
44:21
Yeah.
I'd like the I think like one of the major handicaps outside of the wagon system is and I don't know if this is a UI or aux thing but it's some combination of that of like the new player experience to this game is exceedingly bad.
44:38
Where like if you are trying to draw, I commend the devs for trying to draw people into a more mainstream roguelike.
Experience with this game darkest dungeon one very different game, very different kind of flow to That's fine.
The sequel here.
44:55
It feels like it's trying to be more your standard choose like one of three branching paths or things associated with it.
You have checkpoints your boss fights.
At the end of them.
You have like meta progression on logs.
It's much more kind of familiar territory but like these are all problems that people have solved like with you.
45:16
I stuff.
It doesn't feel like I think does it feel ready for prime time yet, you know, I think that honestly this game like It needs a different Act One hmm it needs an act one that is substantially easier and simplified.
45:36
It needs an act one.
Where there is literally the other symbols aren't even shown to you yet.
There's only poison.
You don't even see that.
There are other characters.
All of your characters are friends.
45:53
They're doing this thing they're going along, like, oh, you don't have armor for your wagon or wield your Like doing anything and you, you know, you get to the boss and like, you know, your hand is help.
Maybe it's a little hard, maybe you die the first time you like, oh no, you play it again through.
46:10
You beat the boss.
You're like, oh cool.
This game is not so bad.
And then it's like absolutely Rex you.
And he says, do you like have a taste of like how the game is supposed to be played before it adds five, other layers of complexity because Throw so much at you.
46:30
And it's like, is poison different than burn.
Should I focus on bleed?
Like it grows every single thing at you and I just, it's just overwhelming.
And I think maybe if the desert listening which, you know, hey, they should because, I mean, why should they probably know they do now?
46:49
They're in the corner, crying right now, but one way to potentially Salvage, what we have going on here is to apply knowledge of, like, what we've learned from other games that are very successful games, like Hades games, like slate Aspire, where there's the that idea of the Ascension levels where if you want to add more difficulty and add more game, mechanics of your own volition mind you.
47:10
So if you wanted to add suddenly your cart Wheels that take damage suddenly suddenly.
Your cart is like one that has armor suddenly lament is a thing like but that's all stuff that you optionally choose.
And in the progression later on early on that stuff, doesn't even exist.
And I think that would solve a lot of the love a gripe that goes into this and I know this game supposed to be hard and unforgiving, but like it's not fun as is.
47:32
And that's the primary thing.
You got to be working out and like a game can be hard and unforgiving and still very fun.
Yeah.
So I don't know if you guys think about that.
But yeah, I mean another I think in that Same day of interview that I was listening to like they they kind of addressed like their initial like hot out of the gate.
47:50
This game got dumped on in Steam Reviews part of my car, my Google doc here.
So according if steam DB rankings are to be trusted for roguelike games that released in 2023 darkest dungeons to rates just below.
48:10
I didn't know either.
These two games existed Rings just Fat sheep crisis and just above sex with Hitler World War Two but okay, so with that in mind, did you play those games to make?
If we get enough interest from our listeners, will put it in the in the to process q.
48:30
But I think at the moment, a Tunes listener.
Yeah yeah.
Fat sheep crisis, they stay tuned.
And a half starts with Hitler, I don't know if that, you know, I think we have a standing rule of no hentai games in here.
There's surprisingly lot of Rogue like hentai games that excluding from our to cover list.
48:49
But anyway, that's where 2069 incredible.
Very positive, it's only $3, it's not $40, but in that same interview I think they were addressing like, hey, this game came out, on Steam, it kind of got dumped on with reviews and their their defense, whether you believe it or not, will something of like, you know, No, we're making the game that we want to play.
49:15
We're not trying to win any awards.
We're not going out there for like this wasn't like a monetary or otherwise.
I don't believe it kind of thing which $40, you know, right?
And you know if if that's true then they made the game that they wanted to make for them and that's perfectly.
49:34
Okay, I think it's okay for them to make a game that doesn't apply doesn't appeal to everyone.
I don't know how that's going to impact future sales of games in the darkest dungeon universe or oh, yeah, that's the engines are DLCs.
But it's not just as all Red Hook.
49:51
I mean, at this point, they've I mean like if they do hold, no, I don't know about that.
I mean, honestly 42.
Like it just it just it blows my mind.
This is what happened.
They had a really good first game and they just decided, hey, let's just crank something out.
50:07
It doesn't matter what it is.
Just as long as it has the same name and I mean, I did this all the time and like Game Dev tycoon or whatever that game is, like we're like making sequels of games.
Like is it easy way to cat, grab cash and maybe ideas that were once they have the cash, they'll be able to make the thing they really want.
50:22
But you know, that's not how I want my I don't want games to be.
Like that.
This is a bad way of going about it.
One thing that really bugged me about this so $40 pretty steep.
I think like there are instances in which like and love, you know, let's be clear like, you know, games a while ago, like the that's 60 dollar game hasn't really liked stayed with inflation.
50:45
Budget should be like what closer to 90 dollars now.
But anyway, like $40 not the end of the world, but like most roguelike games are priced somewhere between like 15 and at most like, $30.
So like to go well outside of that and again like 2D to 3D jump, there's a lot of I feel like I mean honestly like I understand where the 40 dollar it feels like the Polish level of a forty dollar game in terms of, they put a lot of work into the graphics into the like look and feel of the game.
51:23
I mean, we played a lot of games that feel like one, dude.
Made it and it's still a great game despite that but like wow, we really like fun.
Hmm, I started Valley as well.
When I was calling out there.
Well, there's really just started Valley is a good visual game despite that but no like we played a lot of games that are Like objectively don't look good but are still fun to play because like the gameplay is good.
51:53
This is the opposite of that right?
It works very well.
I mean honestly I don't even I think that the battles look pretty good.
Hmm, the wagon sequence stuff.
52:09
I don't really like the look of at all.
I don't really like any there was no part of the wagon stuff that I like not a single.
I hate every single part of it.
I hate the design decisions.
I disagree with the decisions they've made, which is honestly, it's one of the first times that like we played a lot of games where I say, oh, you know, I really Lee, you know, they didn't quite get there, but I really applaud them for like, what they were trying to do was overly ambitious and like, you know, like I want to like this game but it didn't work out kind of thing.
52:46
This feels like they made decisions that are contrary to what I want in a game that I'm playing.
And then they just like made that game as best as they could and to like, oh a fully polished version of a game that I don't want to play. hey man, you know I'm not Particularly like I don't really like the whole Dark Souls stuff like I did, I haven't really enjoyed that.
53:19
Genre of like very punishing game.
So there's like I'm already starting off with this probably is in the genre that's perfectly aligned with what I'm looking for in a game but boy and I I just want to bring up a list.
53:40
Last game of can because I think this is the one that I know has been talked about in interviews especially with like the creators of of course, lay the Spire.
But I like when I think about like these kind of spectrum between monster trains latest fire and an darkest dungeon to with like specifically regarding how you understand what monsters are going to do, how the end, what the enemy's going to do in slay, the Spire the original before they actually showed you.
54:04
The intent of all the creatures was to have it be a mystery so you didn't know if they're going to attack if they were going to defend and they found out very quickly.
With a that's not fun, if you just don't know what they're going to do, it makes it so that your decision making is very much like a feels more, like random like, oh I will, I don't know if they're going to attack.
So I don't know if I should block sort of a thing and so that was one of the first things they implemented and so that what you have to learn about them over time as like, okay, well you go into fights, you're still you can still like even if you don't know anything about the monster, what their capabilities are, you can still kind of get through it pretty well later.
54:35
You learn that 0 when this than the blob is doing like the, you know, has this specific sort of the these Going up sort of a thing, you know, is going to put like five slimes in your hand.
And so that's something have to learn.
And so there's like that's the one way of doing it and then you have Monster train, which is like now, here it is.
All spelled out for you.
54:50
That the only do one thing, they attack you and attack you for a mom that we're very specified.
Or, you know, it's very specific.
They don't do all these block things, all those other crazy things.
And so that's another way.
And then you have this one, which is like you approach it.
And it is that slate Aspire like before they got rid of them before they get shows.
55:06
You intense, you don't no idea what they're doing.
And so you enter the game and you can actually was at the old Under whatever.
And you can like you actually have a library of moves that it slowly builds up over time, but in the beginning, you have no intent and you have no idea what they're going to do.
You have no idea who you should be targeting?
55:22
Is the one in the back.
Is he going to do more days going to do AOE is like you just have no idea.
And I think honestly like this one mechanic right here could solve a lot of the early feelings of like, I don't get it.
I don't understand like how to approach this because all the the feelings of synergy like, you have to learn All the different you have to learn all the enemies, learn all their different abilities, learn how that meshes with your teeth like it's just way too much and I just think that like between these three I think monster train and slay the supplier or kind of like they're both doing the right thing which is an imprint and then you have this one which is just this bastard child which doesn't know exactly what it needs to be and which is just tremendously unfun.
56:03
Yeah.
Is that about right?
I mean like I think I think that's a good way of kind of dividing these up but like is intent doesn't matter like understanding the intent of the enemies are there.
Good games that exist where you don't understand what's going to happen?
I think there are I don't think we've gotten to them yet, but they're in like I'm kind of like spacing on like one that comes to mind immediately because it's been so dominated in that genre of games that have figured this out of like, oh, it is more fun to have combat.
56:31
Be a puzzle that though the enemy's plan.
Doing this.
How am I going to use my player agency to mitigate it versus like?
Okay, like it's just like really disheartening from a new player experience in darkest dungeon stew.
56:49
We're like I was I was totally baffled by the initiative order system again for what?
Yeah, went once.
I figured it out, I'm like, okay, I kind of get it now but like you jump into a fight like your units are like, are all stressed out.
They have low help you jump into a fight with the Cultists and they're just like, they take like one turn at the start like before any initiative you're like, hey wait a minute and then they take another turn and you're like, hey don't we only get one turn per unit here.
57:16
People what's going on there?
Just like no turn turn turn.
What you gonna do?
What are you doing?
You can't hit me.
Hit me, just like, oh my god, really again.
New play.
Like you get through act one and if you're able, you know, to sustain it and you're just like, okay, finally, get what they're trying to do.
57:33
It was not a really elegantly implemented way of getting about it but kind of in that Dark Souls, Ian way of like, okay I'm going to run around this corner and then like giant mushroom punches you in the face and you're dead.
You're like, well, that was dumb.
I don't know why this game is so great.
57:51
I.
But like, the next time you come around that corner like okay, I'm ready for you Mushroom, Man.
Know that until like Dodge and then another mushroom punches you, and you're dead.
Okay?
Like trial by error figuring out like all the ins and outs of this.
Yeah, where every trial is two hours and said, yeah, I got time to take some Dark Souls.
58:07
Like so two minutes, my last, my last real criticism of this game is that there is a literal like not a tooltip but they have like the Encyclopedia of all the tips and whatnot, where they're like, oh you even if you're pretty sure you're going to lose this run.
Got to keep going cause you got to get them candles.
58:25
I can't abandon your run, blah, blah, blah.
And so once you start you have four people.
Once you start losing people, you cannot beat the run but you can continue.
You can keep dragging along for quite some time.
58:43
And it's just like cool.
So now I'm playing a game that I already know is lost what?
20 more minutes.
That's almost the entirety of a darkest.
Dungeon one run that I'm playing them like well this is a lost cause but I guess I want to get some more candles.
58:59
Like I, you know, I got to the last fight with the cultist with two people and I think it is literally impossible to beat it with two people because they out healed my damage.
Like, if I had both my people, Their highest damage they were out healed.
59:15
I did they the the cult has ended the fight with maximum HP, huh?
And more like buff, like they were stronger at the end of the fight, then the start of the fight, but it still took like four minutes for me to lose that fight.
Yeah, yeah.
59:31
I mean, I was before we were recording this, like, I was setting the couch on the steam deck, like again, I'll give kudos to this game, but he's pretty well in the steam deck for not being natively supported on it.
It does choke super hard.
For those wagons segments, that kind of, like, Amanda was sitting on the other couch, and she's just.
59:48
Here's like the fan start worrying on the steamed egg.
And she's like, is that you?
And I'm like, yeah.
She's like, what is, what is doing that?
And like, it's this wagon segment.
She's like, okay, like Sitting there and I was running through the Pigman sewers and yeah, I was just got too greedy in a fight like one guy died and another guy dying.
1:00:10
Like, okay.
I can see where this is going.
Not going to like survive this fight, but like waiting for them to die.
It was going to take like literally just five minutes of watching Pigman squeal at me like again, like maybe pretty funny but like I could just hit that abandoned button and just start a new run.
1:00:28
I'm just going to do that.
It's like oh you're going to lose 20% of your candles like all right.
I don't really care.
I was really motivated at one point to try to fire up cheat engine and see if I could like cheat my my way into like four hundred candles but like, surprisingly difficult.
I'm sure some people have figured it out but I think like the candle drop rate, feels okay.
1:00:49
But what's missing is some like big candle drop sink of like, okay.
If I go here and like fight the mini-boss of this act, that's going to drop like 50 or 100 candles like all at once.
Like, bam, that would be great.
Like, I really want to unlock like this, what we want to go deep into this one, unlock tree but I don't have to play four five or six more hours to do.
1:01:11
So if I just go like, you know, test the odds and you know go and fight this optional mini-boss for the act like that's a whole other topic in and of itself we have to like fight through one way of enemies than another way of enemies.
Then a final boss super punishing at first but like once you kind of get it you get it.
1:01:31
If those guys dropped Like 50 to 100 candles, that would be such a really good magnet.
We're like not only do you have to fight those guys, eventually to get to the mountain in later acts confusingly laid out in the game's encyclopedia.
But that would like, I think really helped to unblock a lot of metal progression with those.
1:01:57
Yeah, I'm adjusting my rating.
Given you everything that we've talked about here is the new number one, adjusted it down, because thinking about it made me more Angry.
Yeah, no.
And I looked at like, you know, Dungeons of Dredmor, I think I had, I had given a five and I'm like, you know what?
1:02:15
I think I'd prefer playing that game actually, so that yeah, okay, let's that's another.
That's another kind of an anchoring point.
Yeah.
Who wants to go first?
Well, I already gave my like kind of where my high-end.
I'll start.
1:02:31
I'll start.
Yeah, we're talking about a valley without wind.
Hmm, I have it above this game.
Whoa.
Wow.
Wow, I have this game as 19 out of 24.
I was actively annoyed while playing this game maybe it was because like you know, I didn't have to, you know, a little bit of annoying day at work when I played at the last time, I got home, just like this game makes me angry and upset and I'm having anti-fun.
1:02:59
I'm like after I'm done playing it.
I wish that I had just sat doing nothing.
Like it's the first game that we've played during this podcast where I can't give them any like, They're only one person or like, oh, they just don't have enough money to make a good game like, every other game that's below.
1:03:19
This are is like, either like a very low production value game or Realm of the Mad.
God was just a fucking wild ass game, but all the other ones are like, oh, you know, there's just no production value.
1:03:34
There's, you know, not very much money went into.
It was a four dollar game like this is I just fundamentally disagree.
Agree with.
How they think Games should make you feel.
1:03:51
And I don't want to play it.
Yep, absolutely.
Well let's have you go next.
I'll all end on maybe a more positive note but then we don't have the the shit sandwich methodology.
But we're following were following the darkest Mantra of starting out as dark as possible.
1:04:10
And ending the light is at the end of the tunnel where we're going to get there.
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, so yeah, like I said, five was a, the kind of the upper limit.
But yeah, I have it coming in at a four point five out of ten which on out of all.
Games that puts it tied it with like three others essentially in 15th Place so close too close to call ins ranking.
1:04:33
And I think that if we were to like normalize these with like by dividing by their price tag, then this would be the worst game.
I think that's a way of thinking about it is.
Yeah, absolutely.
Because all the other ones yet they're like one, two, three, four, five dollars is really cheap.
1:04:49
This is just yeah.
For the for the price it is this is unacceptable.
This is 2023.
We know what makes good game mechanics now and they just decided to look at everything exists and say no we're going to do it wrong.
And so yeah that's I will ever buy another Red Hook game again.
1:05:12
So, I wish I wish that you all out there.
Listening could see Scott's face and how uncomfortable he has right.
Now, with our love will never want to fight me that.
That's good by me.
That's fine, I don't care.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna beat that boss of Doubt here, and I'm going to put this at my, my new number eight out of the 24 games that we played which is just going to put.
1:05:35
It just above Loop hero and just behind hand of Fate too.
This game could have been like as high as my new number five, which would have put it above monster train, and just behind Binding of Isaac but we'll get we'll get to why in a minute here.
1:05:52
I think like darkest dungeon to call and I think you nailed it feels very similar with Loop.
Hero of like you have this kind of ethereal nature of like going out on a run, you got some boss fight.
You have like kind of borderline irritating amount of grind that you got it.
1:06:10
Do but I think like it's maybe a little less grind even Loop hero.
I think I like them about the same but like really wait hand being at getting ahead of myself here with my with my good and bad thing of the Google Doc.
Here we go.
1:06:25
Okay.
Start with a bad first DUI is capital B bad and what I mean by the UI is like the the individual like the art of the UI is really good.
There's just like a baffling design procedure of Like, why can't I Mouse over these things?
1:06:42
Like, when I'm in a choice encounter like why do I have to hold the alt button in order to figure out what the symbology of the bottom means, like, oh, I forgot I forgot.
Another weird thing that I hate.
Why do you have to hold down the button?
Yeah.
Whenever you're making a choice, like, how are you going to map that to a controller like good luck for the console release?
1:07:00
You just have to hold it for, like, two seconds.
Look, why?
I know how to click a button.
Uh-huh.
There's so many times already.
Like going to click a button and then I'd be like, sitting there waiting for something to have him.
Oh right.
I have to hold it.
Yeah sorry continue like until will told me you have to hold down control on the keyboard in order to see like the the saddest tooltips, I'm just like really like that's like I was like furiously like hovering over the little icons like trying to click in like I guess I'm dumb.
1:07:34
I guess there's something wrong with me like That seems like a fixable problem, the new player experience again.
I think like calling nailed it with or moves a colander.
Well, it said like make it like the Ascension levels were like, as First Act.
1:07:52
Yeah, like first act like make it more new player-friendly, second act, add more stuff, third act, add more stuff.
Then, by The Fifth Act, you know, the Super Final Boss.
You have all these compounding factors like, okay.
Now like, it feels like really weighty and heavy and you know that feels more appropriate.
1:08:10
New player experience is bad but fixable wagon driving, totally unnecessary but fixable just like don't make it.
There's there's made the I don't know what the answer is but there's a way to solve for it.
I'm sure this feels like a Triple-A Early Access game without being labeled as such.
1:08:30
I think like it's a good one.
It's well-polished.
There were like basically no bugs that I encountered it kind of crawled a little bit but I feel like it just needs.
A little bit more of like a Nintendo style polishing, run on it, fixable right?
The for the 40 dollar price tag, I think is too much and when the game first launched, this is what really dropped it, like five spots on my ranking, the game first launched like, yeah, I was $40, but if you had dark intentions one, like it was 30 bucks, like, okay, like that feels like what the real price for.
1:09:04
This game should be at full release $30, feels right?
I'm not a marketing guy.
Like I can't run there.
Business Biz Ops for them but you know, if they're not in it for the money price at $30 risk of rain to is $25.
And I think that is another like bamboozling, you know, 2.5 3D game that probably had a lot of production value put into it but like They got rid of that option, they got rid of the option to upgrade.
1:09:32
Like if you have dark dear, a fan of darkest dungeon when you got in your library, you can't get Argos engines two for $30 anymore.
It seems like a minor thing, but they actively time gated that and got rid of it, huge mistake.
I think that is just kind of like a slap in the face to their darkest.
Dungeon one fans just completely unnecessary what they should have done is like they launched this game in Early Access on a Epic game store, nobody played it.
1:09:58
They didn't get any feedback, they should have relaunched it in Early Access on Steam, get player feedback at a low price point of like 20 to 25 dollars, increase it to 30 once it's like Envy 1.0 and I think people probably have a lot less Guff with it.
1:10:14
I know.
Like that's I think my biggest thorn in my side with this thing and I don't know how big's about that is.
I don't know if like they can say Mayock oppa and say, okay, we're going to April Fool's.
We're dropping the price point term.
Permanently the 25 without walking, the back significantly.
1:10:30
But okay, the light at the end of the tunnel, the goods, art style music animation, this game, all great, I really like them.
I think they all work coherently.
It's a really pulse-pounding experience.
Once you get into it, the general gameplay Loop once you grok it, I think is pretty good.
1:10:49
It's not perfect, it's not the best gameplay Loop I've ever played, but it's pretty good.
I think it's in the / Echelon of, I think it's in the top 25% of the games that we played so far.
Each run, I think feels pretty different once you get used to it.
1:11:06
There's like, and by that, I mean, like, okay, and this run, I'm going to focus on just getting candles on this run.
I'm going to focus on beating this mini boss, the little character side objectives, I think help to diversify like what you should be focusing on and kind of sprinkle out like things that you should do that, that feels okay.
1:11:24
The boss fights I think are well done.
What do you like lose to them at least once and you're like okay now I know what to do.
I've watched a guy, I don't know if that's totally necessary for everyone, but like it beating a boss, feels satisfactory like I feel accomplished by doing so and then once like you have all of these like complicated European board game systems under your belt, it for me it does have that kind of one more run feel to it.
1:11:53
I feel like that's kind of like a major hook for roguelike.
Game.
So yeah, this is Gonna Roll in at number eight, for me and our overall ranking for this game is going to be our new 15 out of 20 for putting out as down from like 12 of 24 that.
1:12:10
Yeah, podcast.
Yeah.
Putting it just above Dungeons of Dredmor just behind hand of Fate 14.
It's its final resting place here.
Cool.
That was dark as dungeons 2.
1:12:30
I'm sad that I'm outside the refund period because otherwise, you better believe I'd be uninstalling right now and getting my refund.
Got a nice bottle of whiskey.
Right.
Get so you don't remember this game, right?
1:12:48
Yeah.
I'm gonna put that in the zoom chat on awful.
Say it on the podcast though.
But anyway, yeah.
So that that's gonna do it for our darkest dungeon to show, here are email if you want to write into the show, I'm sure the devs will send us a bunch of hate mail to To our e-mail Grog pods own at gmail.com.
1:13:10
We're going to lose a lot of followers on our Mastodon, Grog POD at Game Dev da plays and we're definitely gonna get ddosed by all the DD to fans at as ddot's darkest dungeon, original sin.
Maybe Grandpa dot Zone where you can find all of our rankings.
1:13:28
You can find a previous episodes that we've done our next episode out of our random grab bag between Armored Commander to desktop dungeons, not burkas avengers, but desktop Dungeons and it's rewind counterpart and shattered.
1:13:44
Pixel Dungeon will you you are interested in having us play shattered, Pixel Dungeon, I'm am only one who voted.
It looks like in our little system here, but I said, absolutely no two armored Commander has that just looks like a cog.
Mine's a variety sort of game looks like cock my.
1:14:02
I mean I mean it it is it is a like built with the same Rex pain.
Ain't you?
I yeah.
And it was was World War Two Rogue like tanks calling just as a shit I was thinking of different game.
I should have I should have read your messages more closely.
1:14:18
This looks great.
Do we have?
Should we do a coin flip off what?
No way home.
Oh wait a minute now Collins.
No no no.
I want to I want to do the pixel on.
I want it.
I'm interested in doing a mobile game.
I think it's a like that's that's a an entire territory.
1:14:35
We haven't even looked at yet.
So I think that be Yeah, that's interesting to me and it's a traditional roguelike to and the other one was the was it dungeons that will just wanted desktop to?
And I think I played the first one because it was like available through your steam library and I just uh I just hated it and this is like the rewind of it.
1:14:53
So another maybe is this is the case where sometimes the sequel gets better, unlike what we've just seen but I don't know, I'd rather go with something, completely new and on a different platform.
So, try out a mobile game.
I've never done that.
Actually, I don't really do any mobile games at all.
So, So I'm curious to see if I'll hate it or like it.
1:15:10
Yeah, we were talking about this offline a little bit.
There is, there's a pretty deep amount of roguelike games that are that are on Steam that you can play on mobile.
Most notably magic survival, which inspired the whole vampire.
Survivors craze is mobile only and you can't find it basically any rails.
1:15:27
But like the the database for like trying to find, like just tell me all the roguelike games on on Android or iOS like disturbingly difficult to I'd like it is not easy to find that big list of games is more.
Almost kind of like Word of Mouth.
1:15:43
Yeah.
There's like a good amount of them.
And yeah, I am also excited to try seeing how this kind of dungeon diving experience will work.
Don't you guys have phones on my on my phone here?
So that's going to wind up our darkest episode yet.
1:16:04
Maybe Valley with that one's darker, but I like Valley with That wind, it was a stupid game, but I liked it just a little bit more than I liked it.
You know, 18 x 24.
Well also to play out this episode is going to be a battle against Madness nihilism and hopelessness itself as podcast episode that is.
1:16:27
If all of those things took the form of demonic keychains and a disembodied, pulsating break.
