Greetings friends, and welcome to yet another episode of the Grog Pod Roguelike podcast, wherein each episode we roll the die on a rogue game and then complain about it for 90 minutes.
And then afterwards we we rate them and we compile all that scientific data and ratings and put them in a in a bloodbath tournament to the death at the end of the season if the game is is ranked high enough.
1:01
I am your host of the podcast.
No, wait, no, that's not right.
Undo, undo, undo re roll that I'm your host of the podcast.
That's much better.
Scott Berger.
And with me are my 6 sided Co hosts.
Oh wait, what's that?
1:19
I don't know if we have the chronicle.
Will has returned, of course.
I'm sorry to have stepped in front of you.
Go first.
Oh I'm the the very right hand side X always turns up when you least need it will.
And I am Andrew the Slicer Dicer Meister Harshman.
1:38
And I'm calling the cute little cat that must be protected at all costs.
This week we are playing the DND Beyond Combat Dice simulator.
Slice and Dice released June 16th, 2021 on itch dot IO and about a month later on Android and iOS and only just recently this year, 2024, coming to Steam on March 20th with a big three-point O update.
2:05
It's kind of launched it back into into the public consciousness in a way.
Slice and Dice was developed and published by a developer who is is famously reclusive in oxymoron Tan TANN, who I think is is even more reclusive than the the bilatro developer.
2:28
And we have we have art done by a three UM pixels slice and dice rolls in on our stat sheet on with our #400 and 60th most popular rogue glade game on steam with 13128 total reviews.
2:47
If we go back to its itch page and look there, it only has about 639 and I thought this was wild.
This game you're.
Looking at the mobile stats.
Yes, I'm looking at the mobile stats 'cause I had to pull it.
We'll get to in a minute, but this game is very popular on mobile.
3:04
On iOS, it has 372 total rankings.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Android 17,300 Total Reviews.
Over 1,000,000 downloads.
Yeah.
I played it primarily on mobile.
Oh, really?
OK, This this.
Will be I'm I'm gonna, I'm slowly becoming the, the niche niche weirdo who's playing the games on mobile.
3:26
Zelenials these days, am I right?
Gen.
Alpha kids Your average player of slice and dice has about 24 hours of logged gameplay time in it.
Will you have just picked up the tier 6 curse of having to describe in one sentence what one does in slice and dice?
3:44
I was.
Afraid you're going to pick me?
Let's see here.
I have nothing prepared.
Let's see here.
Slice and dice.
Look at the one sentence.
One sentence.
Slice and Dice is a rogue lot rogue light game.
Who would have guessed?
It's a rogue light game where you are going through a series of 20 fights and you're doing oh God, it's a run on sentence now, but 5V some number of enemies and each of your your your dudes has a unique die with a bunch of moves that can change.
4:16
And obviously there's upgrading and whatnot over time.
This is the longest sentence ever.
There you go, that's what it is.
Hell yeah, he's still got it, folks.
Well, well put together.
That I think covers it.
You know, when we were doing our, our Doom RL and Jupiter Hell double game extravaganza, I was, I was having a hard time because the intrusive thoughts of slice and dice was slowly creeping in to my play time there.
4:42
And I was like, OK, I know like I had, I had a different game scheduled for the slot and I thought, OK, well, I have to bump it because I have become cripplingly addicted to this game.
And I can't think of of a better pure judgement game for for Will to unleash his opinions on than than this game.
5:06
Well, I I mean it's it's a fine game, a game as well.
We'll find in the very end here, but it's not going to it's not going to top the charts.
And I can appreciate, you know, why you might think that I would really enjoy this, but it definitely it has its its drawbacks.
That said, for devices like mobile devices, I think that's, I mean, I I'm, you know, why not play it on APC if you have APC in front of you?
5:29
But if I ever had to use a mobile device, it seems like I think this would be probably the best mobile game out there.
I mean, I'm not aware of the quality and the the the variety that are out there right now.
I just kind of put them all into the shit tier in general unless it's chess.
And so this is like probably on par with the doing chess puzzles.
5:47
And so that means it's the best out there.
I mean, that seems reasonable.
Yeah, I mean, that's the reason why I, I actually bought it twice.
I bought it once on Steam and then again on the phone because I, I, I was, you know, in the line for the ferry waiting for two hours doing on the stupid ferry.
6:04
And I was like, man, I want to play that game that I started playing.
And then I beat the demo and I was like, oh, it's only 12 levels on the demo for free.
And like, fine, I guess I'll buy it.
And then I put the rest of it on there, 'cause I'm, you know, I've been traveling around and it's in your pocket.
And imagine that, that temptation to play on your computer.
6:23
Imagine if it was in your, on your pocket.
You have your phone with you all the time.
If only they've kept the 12 round model right?
Exactly.
I mean, that's that goes into one of the long list of or not the the somewhat short list of extremely negative qualities, but.
Scott, I I want to sorry real quick, do a little modification if I may on the this is like one of the best mobile games out there, best mobile games out there.
6:46
If you have a 95 minute bus ride commute, I think is about is about perfect.
These runs are they're they're a little they out stay they're welcome.
I think overstayed rather.
Agreed, but Scott says he's addicted and I'm addicted like where you know it it I've I've definitely had that pull while we're playing another game for the podcast and I'm just like, I'm really enjoying this other game and it feels like it's you know, I I divert the time into the other game.
7:14
But Scott, what what was doing it for you here because.
It.
Didn't get me that.
I didn't get the hooks.
That's a good question 'cause I think like I can sympathize with the with the feeling at first because when like I I saw that the big three-point O update had come out and I was like, OK, I finally don't have an excuse to be avoiding the itch dot IO version.
7:35
I'll buy it.
I know that I'm gonna like play it eventually and it's 8 bucks.
It's it's fine.
Buy it player, noodle around with it and on the on like the Super easy difficulty mode, I'm like, OK, yeah, I, I can, I get it.
I think I understand why people like this.
7:53
And then it just, it kind of like sat in the back of my mind for a little bit.
And then I thought maybe I'll, I'll just play one more round.
And that's how they get you.
That's how they get you with these, with these mobile games these days.
Just one more round, man, Just one more.
And then you see this drip feed of achievements that comes in like, oh, you've unlocked this new little goodie to play with.
8:14
Don't you want to go play with this new little goodie?
And I'm like, yeah.
And then I started learning about all the other modes in this game.
And we'll get to all the all the stuff that's in this game in a minute.
But like it just kind of got got its hooks into me slowly and then just kind of didn't let go.
8:33
And I think I'm, I'm kind of hitting a plateau moment right now for like skill wise, but I've put in like, I don't know, 40-5 hours into this game.
And I feel like my third eye is only just starting to open of like, oh, like the the play space is, is out there.
8:51
And I feel like I'm just leaving the kindergarten playpen right now.
I mean, I will say I've I've also got the itch a little bit.
I've been jonesing.
IO if you will haha.
I, I, I, I feel like perhaps I'm going to reach the plateau slightly earlier than you, Scott, but I have very much enjoyed playing it.
9:12
I think it's like it's got a good like being able to chest puzzle your way out feels really good if you get it right.
And there's also like I, I, I would say that normally rolling 6 sided dice kind of randomness is not what I like, but there is between the re rolls and, and you know, you can roll the dice up to three times for each of these characters trying to get like the side you want.
9:44
So you can use that action.
And I feel like usually you can get something, but then there's that little bit of like, all right, I'm going to push my luck like this isn't exactly the one I want.
I'm going to roll it.
And getting the thing that you really did want to like let you let you win that fight or keep you afloat really does feel good.
10:05
So.
I mean, I'll agree with that for sure, but it's just like, you know, hey, I've got an hour before bed.
Oh man, I really want to play that.
Oh, wait a minute, an hour.
That's not gonna be enough.
And what's gonna happen?
And this did.
Happen is.
You're gonna stay up until like, you know, 1:00 AM and you're like, fuck, I just lost on the very last level and now I'm angry and I have to go to bed and I'm not gonna get enough sleep.
10:26
It's it's terrible.
Yeah.
I don't lose.
The what?
What's interesting about this game compared to some other like deck builder question mark games that we've talked about is is this undo mechanic, which I think is is sort of the core conceit here where yeah, you're you have a number of heroes, you have a number of enemies and it's it's very straightforward.
10:52
You just you roll your die, you apply what the die do, but you have a certain number of re rolls that you can do.
And this is kind of like your experimental play space and where I think this is where it really it locked in for me versus something like Bilatro.
Where you in in Bilatro, it felt like to me that OK, you have this puzzle in front of you and you have to figure out what the solution is.
11:16
And you have one shot to figure out what the solution is.
Obviously it's not like make or break for that one shot, but you know, you have to figure out the math in your head ahead of time.
Be like a simulator.
Obviously.
I think this is I think this is the answer.
And then you hit that go button or you discard your hand accidentally like me.
11:35
Oh, you hit that go button and you're like, OK, did that give me the requisite number of points that I thought it did?
OK, it did great.
I think I know how my engine is running versus here where it's like you, you roll your die and you have a, a set number of of dice faces and you're like, OK, well, what can I do with this?
11:54
Can I do anything interesting here?
Maybe not.
I'll, I'll undo and maybe I'll try a different sequence of the dice.
So like it's very order of operations heavy.
And if none of that works, you're like, all right, just give me another roll of the dice here.
12:09
Maybe I'll get some better dice faces.
Maybe you will.
Maybe you'll get that that coveted right most blank side that totally torpedoes your whole strategy on the final boss, which has happened to me numerous times.
But that I think is what is what hooked me as like, oh, this is this is an interesting and different approach to this kind of, again, I keep wanting to say deck builder, but it's not really it's not.
12:36
It's not even really a dice builder per SE.
It is.
It is this unique approach to how you solve this puzzle that I just haven't seen before.
And it was very fun to play with.
I agree.
Are you playing every role?
12:52
Because it sounds like you're, you're really trying to get the most out of everything.
And I know for me, I'm probably about 90% of the time I'm really only playing the last role after I've kept ones and I've rerolled.
And then I I'm kind of left with the either you have one role left and it's like this is decent, or I'll find I'll just do the last one most of the time.
13:10
I think I'm mostly like and again, I I don't know if if a lot of the strategies that I will be talking about are actually good or not because I have a one for eight win rate on normal.
So I think I'm actually objectively bad at this.
13:27
Game well and you can't you can't one play.
You're not replaying the roles you're replaying the once you've rolled and locked in your dice.
That's really like the thing that that I feel like you're, you're, you're playing around with, you're like, OK, I've got these five dice and I need to attack these things and I need to these, these events to happen certain sequences and the enemies have certain things that happen.
13:50
Like you hit.
If you defeat a skeleton, it causes the things next to it to do one damage or to take one damage.
So you're like, OK, so I need to beat them with this guy in this order.
And then these abilities on our side proc you hit.
And they're like the combinatorics of that.
14:06
You can actually like with the same 5 dice, you can get vastly different results if you apply them in a different order.
True, but if you if you get a sequence of five dice from a roll and they're all blanks except for one that's like total garbage, then you know that you're just like, OK, this is this.
14:25
I'll lock in this one dice here and then I'll re roll it like it's I feel like there are a lot of cases where you can kind of tell that like, yeah, I'll just re roll this, but not always because there are sometimes where I'm like, maybe I'll experiment with this one.
And I find this very like subtle order of operations combined with all the the wacky items that that does a thing.
14:46
I didn't quite expect it to.
And like, oh huzzah, I won with the thing I didn't expect to and I I didn't want to wound up having to to re roll.
I will say like a vast majority of the time, yeah, I am just like roll OK, which of the these dice seem good for what I need to do for this enemy grouping?
15:04
Lock in that dice, re roll OK, lock in this one.
Re roll, lock in this last one.
I've got like two extra dice that don't do anything, then try to puzzle it out and then the enemies attack and I die and I get mad.
Did you, I mean, one of the kind of categories of things to talk here are the our heroes and our enemies.
15:22
And I, I think I can really appreciate the variety of the heroes that you have to select from.
And the way it works in the game is you start off with A5 either selected at random or this kind of preset configurations of I think it's like five base classes or, and then there's like an extra bonus one, I don't remember in particular.
15:41
But basically it, it goes out.
I think you get 4 for the starting class at level one.
And as you go through, you know, there's 20.
And so you're at every four levels you or, so I think you, or what's the, it's every two levels actually, I, I forgot, but, but, but by the end of it, you have these all upgraded to Level 3.
15:58
And so levels two and three, you get 8 characters per class.
And so there's a lot of variety.
And as you upgrade, it's always completely like a random selection from this, from this group of 8.
And so I, I just really like to the, the, how much variety there was there.
16:14
I like the names of the characters, their move sets are all very interesting.
The Magic played really well, I think.
Yeah, there's a lot of synergies to be built around just the unique combinations of these these teams.
But that also made it so that like, if you aren't, if you don't have a guide or something and you, you have to play the game like, I mean, probably at least 20 to 40 like runs before you get a sense of like, this one's just universally bad.
16:36
This one's good sometimes.
And like it's, it's like, and then you have to know all the items too, because you have to be like, Oh, this, this item is more likely the one that takes the right hand slots that you know.
So therefore, if I have a character that has that more likely to be open, it just it's a really a frustrating thing to to realize that you have to dedicate a lot of time or use a guide and using a guide feels like cheating.
16:59
And I I just didn't like that.
I did because I just.
I want to, I want to ask how so you, you're the Bellatro master here.
I want to ask how, how did you puzzle out all of the synergies between stuff and Bellatro?
Because that was something that I felt similarly overwhelmed because I'm like, you know, gosh, there's so many like interactions between stuff here.
17:21
Like, I don't quite really know like how to experiment with things.
Like, were you for Bilatro?
Were you consulting like a wiki?
Were you just watching?
YouTube streams, I built everything from the ground up for that.
That was all like I, I, I went into the wiki I, I, I was actually typing because it was difficult to like parse out and just directly pull into a spreadsheet.
17:40
I typed the names, I typed their abilities, I typed like what does everything.
And then I had like A-150 by or 150 grid or so.
And I was looking for synergies between them.
And it's interesting.
It was a time consuming, but it was a a labor of love.
17:56
Yeah, well, yeah, there's there's no shortage of stuff in slice and days like, I mean like you were talking about a minute ago.
You have your your five different colors of heroes which correspond to the to the different classes like assassins who do high damage, low defense, yellow warriors, good all arounders.
18:14
You have your Gray shield guys, your red healers, your blue spell casters and green special heroes that you have to unlock doing certain stuff, but there is there is 128 different heroes in the game, most of which you get from from just like upgrades and stuff as you go along.
18:34
There's 67 different monsters that you fight there's 472 items in this game a varying tiers from like Tier 1 to tier 9 and all that as you progress through through a run.
There's 191 total keywords, 465 curses and 133 total achievements that you can unlock.
18:58
Now this might all sound like, Oh my God, there's so much shit to unlock.
Like there is a very handy dandy that's great.
Unlock all this for me now please button and I don't know that did any of us hit that?
I didn't.
Nah.
I wish I would have been hindsight but and.
19:15
I think another one of the things that I that was kind of crippingly addicting for me is like, I think the drip feed of those achievements of like, oh, if you win like 50 rounds or yeah, like 50 battles, then you unlock a thing.
If you unlock 7 or if you beat 75 battles, you'll unlock a thing.
19:32
Like it just unlocked it.
Just this kind of perfect drip feed pace for me that it almost didn't feel necessary for me to hit that unlock all button.
But I can see, like if you, you know, had had bought the game on a separate platform, you're just like, yeah, I don't want to grind through all that stuff.
19:48
Unlock now, please.
And moreover, like, there are, there are a lot of modes in this game outside the kind of standard loop that we were talking about where, you know, you fight through 3 battles, you fight a mini boss, 3 battles, you fight a mini boss, and then up to level 20 you fight the mega boss.
20:06
That's your kind of standard loop.
Easy, normal, hard.
There's curses involved at higher difficulties, that kind of thing.
But there are lots of other wacky modes in this game.
There is.
There is classic Unfair, which gives you even more curses.
20:25
You have to pick from a pool of like 10 curse points To make you run even harder.
There's Raid mode, where normally instead of starting with five heroes, you start with 10 heroes.
No items.
I thought that.
I thought that mode was actually pretty fun.
20:42
So long.
And oh, and worth noting, the enemies are also doubled as well.
You have a generate mode, which all the heroes we've been talking about so far have have preset dice faces that with abilities.
20:59
Generate is the Wild West.
All of the heroes are randomly generated with random abilities that are obviously specific for their character classes.
But it can get pretty wild with how crazy those characters can be.
21:15
You have if you win 195 fights or battles in this game, you unlock easy mode and you might well OK, heaven mode.
There is an easy mode, but heaven mode is like come break the game at your will where it's it's basically like easy, very easy.
21:36
Yeah.
But like you, you can pick from a pool of like 20 blessing points to be like I want to start with an extra character and I want all the enemies to start damaged and they start poisoned in all this so.
I I played a a heaven mode game yesterday and one of the options was use all these 20 points and it's whenever one of the monster dies it does 5 damage to the monsters next to it.
21:59
And so you're basically just like it's just win mode until you get to the boss, in which case then it's not as good.
But.
Maybe that's the, you know, night time quick run mode that yeah, it's just.
Like I just want to watch the monsters.
Die.
Yeah, It is worth pointing out there is a shortcut mode that starts you at like level 8 or 12 or something.
22:20
It skips like a good chunk of it, but but it does, it throws your build out the window because it's like, all right, well, we're just going to start you with random stuff.
Good luck.
And also important to note, there is an instant mode which is a literal everything is random, one single battle and you just, you fight literally one fight.
22:39
And there's no, obviously there's no leaderboards or anything for it.
But also there there's a speed run mode, which people the speed run mode limits you to 15 minutes.
If you can beat the game in 15 minutes, you get up on that leaderboard.
22:57
Some other modes.
It is, it is worth pointing out, a a major draw.
So like all of the all of the pros for this game bounce between classic, hard, classic unfair and the cursed modes, I'm pretty sure.
And the cursed modes are let's see standard cursed.
23:16
You unlock that by by just beating one round with anyone curse.
And that is where like after after each boss you accumulate a curse.
And this begins a big thing in this game called like looping where you go through A20A20 round sequence Hooray.
23:32
You start back at the beginning and you continue the loop and you try to see how many loops you can go infinitely blurst is the same idea, but you start you start with a tier 3 blessing and then you accumulate curses after each boss.
23:49
That one I thought took forever.
Cursed hyper where you you start or yeah you gain a curse after every single battle and then beating a boss you choose a blessing to balance it out which is interesting.
24:08
This is too many modes.
This is too.
I haven't even it's a.
Lot of modes but I feel like most of them are you you try them once or not.
If I may very quickly read from the Steam description page, it says here features 128 hero classes and then parentheses plus 99,999 question mark, which real quick sidebar.
24:32
I hate it when games do that.
Like Borderlands was the first to do it.
It's like we have 1,000,000 guns and it's like, yeah, right, you did the math.
I'm like, it's like, here's every single possible premeditation and like, it's like, you can't really say that I'm I'm glad that they put in parentheses as kind of a goof.
Anyway, 120 the 8 year old class is 73 monsters, however many items and quote too many modes.
24:55
So like they they, they're even aware of it.
I will say that the the bounty of modes in this game does seem like a lot, but it feels like there's kind of something for everyone here.
And I know that like this game, like, you know, there, there's aspects of this game that I think a lot of people gravitate towards certain things and not everyone gravitates towards the same thing, which is super interesting because like if everyone like I think the slice and dice subreddit, their favorite mode is Blertra, which is blessed cursed Ultra mode, kind of combining all the stuff and it it it, it has a little warning when you pick it says warning long.
25:40
Yeah.
And interesting the I think the appeal there is like how long, how long can I keep this run alive?
Like how many wins can I go?
People getting like 999 wins to cap it out on on the top of the leaderboard.
Very impressive.
25:56
Not my jam because like I think I'm kind of in agreement with the rest of the of the pool here.
This game seems like it takes a long time for for I think at our skill level.
When I watch streams of people doing this like they're somehow like blasting through this game like 30 minutes, which seems crazy to me.
26:14
But again, I think like I.
Want to see how fast I can do a normal run after you guys.
I mean, I was trying a heaven run this morning to see if I could, if I could beat it again on my on my bus ride, about 30 minute bus ride.
And I think I'm still going like 45 minutes and I think I'm like a 2/3 of the way through.
26:32
So I don't think I'm gonna I don't think I'm gonna get under an hour, but but it is impressive to see just how how fast people play this again, coming back to like to some other like heavy hitters strategy games, like in the same vein, I feel like bilatro feels like the same length to me.
26:55
Is that true?
No shaking heads.
No, Bilatro is much shorter.
Much shorter.
Much shorter.
Really it's, it's what is that that's about AI want to say it's an hour.
It's been a while since I played it, but I, I feel like it was 50 minutes to an hour.
I think 'cause I think Spire is like similar time.
27:11
I remember like, you know, there's the, the peak perfect time is like 45 minutes to one hour.
And I think they were.
And like, unless you get to the like, you know, some kind of super hard motor, you're actually trying to kill the heart.
I think my my normal and hard runs were around an hour or so with me kind of like half paying attention to it on on the couch on the steam deck.
27:31
But like, I feel like when I was playing bilatro it was taking like a similarly long amount of time, no?
I guess I think.
Bilatro is slightly faster in my opinion.
You.
You, you, you, you, you tend to die like, not just like at the beginning or the end.
27:48
You tend to die like pretty much at a, well, not uniform.
It's very much like in the beginning.
I would do like lots of roles to try and get a good start.
And then it's a pretty like uniform distribution about where you're going to lose in the process.
Yeah, maybe that's, I feel like this game, you die a lot on the last box.
28:03
Exactly.
And that is which is frustrating fucking problem for this game because it's so frustrating and it's just such a huge time investment just to like the the the scaling of difficulty needs like some work there, because that's not fun to to have that that the most deaths you have is at the end.
28:19
And so you're obligated to like go all the way through the end.
That's a big difference.
One thing that and again like people, the slice and dice pros that are listening to this and are like slamming their cars to a stop on the freeway like these guys are totally wrong.
Again, like we are we are not that skilled at this game at this point because it it feels like this game requires a lot of investment into the symbology and like language of the game.
28:47
Like I am.
I am not good at slay the Spire at all because I have no idea like what any of the of like the artifacts synergies do really.
And I know that like, oh, if I put in that time investment into that, like, yeah, I could like blitz through like an ironclad run in like 20 minutes because I have like all this stuff memorized.
29:06
But with, if you have your game with like like 400 plus items and like all these different synergies and keywords and stuff, there's a lot to take in.
Like I can understand why, you know, your typical player of this game has like 20 plus hours because that that feels like that's about how long it takes to come to come to grips with like the order of operations, how things interact with each other and all that.
29:29
And where was I going with this?
Something about skill.
I mean, I think I just, I think we're going with it is that like, yes, at this point, I mean, I'm 24 hours in and I can see that like in order, like the skill level is much, much higher than my ability and I I won the first round or the easy first try, normal first try.
29:49
Like these are kind of games that I get.
But I, it's clear to me that like in selecting heroes and selecting items in particular, like there is a lot that you, you basically have to have the memorized because the item selection is not just based on the character that you have now with a certain dice configuration.
30:05
It's about the possibilities of what that can turn into in the future.
And so you have to factor in like right, you have to memorize all the heroes, dice and essentially.
Oh, this is a great this is a great item for my hero now, but he's level one and he's about to become level 2, so all those blanks are going to go away.
30:22
So this item is going to be good only for like one round.
Right, or you'll, you'll not even this that you have to do that for all of your characters to keep them bad in mind because oh, it'll probably work for this if it gets this, if not, then this one.
But this one's already been, you know, level two.
It's about at Level 3.
This will be much better.
Like it's all, it feels like it's a, you know, if you have good play at this level, you're, you're and you're, you're doing probably about 70% of what you would be doing if you were like a maximum tier.
30:53
And even things like selecting curses, I think if you add that in there too, selecting all these like selections of one of hundreds, is it maybe it's maybe or maybe like right now, maybe I'm like at 60% of what I would be if I memorized everything and had a sense for it.
But.
31:09
One thing one thing that I thought of to as a suggestion for the developer.
I have AI have a a four point O slice and dice wish list here and one of the items on it is like, yeah, 100%.
I share the pain with the final boss because there's a handful of different final bosses here that are very hard.
31:31
There you have your standard dragon, which shoots poison and big fireballs and is it kind of does what it says on the tin, but there's some other bosses on here that can just like straight up a hard counter.
Lots of styles of play.
And it's it's like it reminds me of that scene in the Matrix where the guy jumps on Neo when he's when he's plugged in, he's like surprise asshole.
31:52
Like that's what it feels like with the boss fights sometimes where like, oh, I've got like this really great build going and then like the boss comes in and yeah, like I know that there's a one in four chance of that boss coming up, but how like I don't know it, it feels it feels not fun when that happens.
32:11
And like at least Bilatro, you have like a warning that like, OK, in this next anti, like yes, this is what the boss is going to be at that time.
Like you don't have much time to prepare lone.
Star has the same thing where you can see the you know in each like 3 boss phase you can see what the boss is at the end so you at least have like a couple rounds to decide your build.
32:35
Me like, oh, I can't do this.
Play Aspire 2, it's like on the you always see the bosses and so like otherwise, yeah, I'd say it is bullshit because if you are doing like a maximum draw and you get to the dude who's like you get 12 cards draw and then you're done for your turn, you are 100% hard countered and it's terrible.
32:51
But you get you get like one act to try and curve into something else.
But there's always a surprise in this game.
Yeah, yes.
Just lower the difficulty in general or give more.
Hexia specifically the Hexia boss is pretty she does the whatever your mana cost for your spell is does that damage to the lowest character.
33:11
It's like, oh cool, I've been doing a everyone build mana based build and now I just lose because oh also I do whatever damage done to me I do back.
So it's like cool, I was doing mana and healing.
33:26
It's like, well, cool.
Yeah, like that, that was my exact play experience with the last normal run that I did where like it, it felt like, OK, I have like I I failed a whole bunch of times on hard.
I'm like, OK, well, I'll go back down to normal just just as a breather and normal mode, it can still be like pretty devastatingly hard at our skill level.
33:51
Well, don't, don't, don't bunch me in there.
With that, I mean Mr. One, Mr. One for one here.
But yeah, and I think the solution here is as after each fight you have like this little very basic map of like, oh, you are, you are progressing through, I don't know, stages of hell or, or through into the demon world or something.
34:13
And you know, it's like diamond, diamond, diamond big skull face for mini boss fight, diamond, diamond, diamond, big skull face.
And it's the same big skull face for the final boss fight.
If that was like a different symbol over the like the main like Uber boss, like if you're going to fight the hand or if you're going to fight inevitable or the dragon, like at least give me some warning that like, you know, right.
34:36
You should be able to.
You should be able to hover over it and see what that boss is.
Yeah.
And then like it doesn't, it doesn't Telegraph it at the beginning of the run per SE.
And I don't know if this is something that's kind of like hard coded into the game.
I could totally see that.
But like if it if it was just like that symbol was, you know, dragon shaped, I'd be like, OK, I know I have one mini boss and three regular rounds to fight before I know the Dragon's coming, so I can kind of get my head space into that again.
35:04
I would love to know how people who have like crazy streaks in like hard, unfair or the cursed modes like it had figured this out.
I'm sure they have were like, oh, I'm just going to plan for every possible contingency and then it just happens to work.
I don't know that we have quite grocked that yet, but it feels like that That would be probably the top of my wish list for the next major update.
35:30
Yeah, I agree.
My or maybe this is somewhat unrelated, but I'm thinking about like, you know, you're, you're trying to make your builds all synergize up towards something at the end.
And I feel like that also can be something that's in my 4 point O wish list is that some of them are some of the the pics are not are are are objectively worse than others for the characters.
35:59
And like you can kind of build them into your build, but it's hard to like if you're, if you're like a tier 3, some of them are just bad.
And it it you're like, well, I don't want that one and I know it's tier 3, so I'm not going to get another chance and I could just skip it.
36:17
Then it's just like, cool, my dude's just worse now.
I think that and then also you still don't know what you're building towards.
So like it could be that some of those characters have really niche uses where you're like, oh, this one character that's bad is actually good if you're fighting this boss, but I don't know that boss that I'm fighting or.
36:39
If I have like the right item combo 1.
Thing or if you have the right item combo.
Yeah.
And, and so one thing I wanted to ask the group here was that like, you know, there, there are published tiered lists for heroes and stuff.
And I had been following that as like my Bible for for all.
Of my peer reviewed, what do you mean published?
36:57
Published in so far that it is a Google Sheet.
That in the way that a blog is published, In the way that this podcast is published.
Yeah, got us, Got us.
Yeah.
And so like, you know, like what Colin's talking about, you know, if I have a choice between.
Let's see a level A Level 3 Orange Hero fencer is labeled as Big Happy versus A Level 3.
37:20
Labeling system.
Good Lord, just give me the numbers.
Big happy to big sad.
What are we?
Who?
Who would you pick between Orange 3 Fencer and Orange 3 Ludus?
Who is ranked as Big Sad?
Yeah, Ludus is bad.
Ludus is so boring.
37:36
But but here's the thing.
And so like this is this is kind of the conundrum that I was asking myself was like, well, am I just like, hey, I don't really know how these rankings are formulated.
Like I can kind of, I can kind of get like, yeah, like I can see the utility of this one versus the other one.
But are there?
37:54
I feel like there are instances again coming back to like Bilatra and Slay the Spire where you don't want to always pick the S tier option because based on what you've accumulated throughout your run, there might be like a synergistic reason why you would want to pick Ludus.
38:11
Well, OK, so I can give you exactly the the thing there is item.
There is an item that is for like every side that is just a straight normal sword add like up hip and something.
If you got him who has six swords on these things.
38:29
There's like this item fucking rules for this guy.
I would never pick him except I happen to have got this item before and now this guy is going to become bonkers.
But you could you, but you don't know you're going to get that.
Like you can't build towards that synergy like all of the weapon or like all of the item choices are here's two, pick one.
38:53
There's no way to like bank them for the future or like buy something from a larger like list of something.
And I know this is a criticism that Will had when we talked about it before is that it is just battles.
39:08
There's only there's 20 battles in a row and then you at the end of each battle, you either get an upgrade or you or every character or you get an item.
There is nothing outside of that.
And I think otherwise the game would be called Slice and dice in shop then.
39:25
Well, I mean, it's not called Slay the Spire in shop.
All.
I mean, I'm pretty sure this applies, but I think the, the town experience, like as a general, like metaphor games where you're, you're doing something hard, you're really engaged and then you come back and you have your respites.
39:41
You're kind of like that's what you're doing, your tinkering or whatever your else is doing.
You have to have the back and forth.
And I think that, you know, I, I don't know how many points you assign to each of these categories, probably more for the battle side.
But yeah, if it's just battle after battle and you're like the whole the town experience is making a choice of one of two or one of three, that's not enough.
40:00
And I know it's latest fire because we have to, you know, talk about it every single podcast.
Yeah, you, you do have some back-to-back fights sometimes, but you have events.
Oh my goodness, the events add so much to the variety of the game.
And it's not just events, it's the campfires.
40:16
It's.
The well don't worry will this does have events.
Some events such as replace this hero with a random hero, which I've never used because I'm like well how do I know it's not going to be worse?
At least I know that the items I have for this here I've built for this.
Like I mean, if you want to consider that events, I mean.
40:32
They call it events in the in the the way they do it I'm putting air.
I shouldn't put air quotes around it like events.
Yeah, that's just a bad game design right there.
And I think that's one of the reason it's not going to.
It didn't hook me.
I think a better comparison is like like bilatro doesn't have an item shop purse.
40:51
Well, I.
Guess no, it absolutely hasn't.
Well, OK, it does, but not in the same like like story sense, I guess.
And I'm also, I'm thinking also along the lines like luck be a landlord where like luck be a landlord is just go, go, go.
It is just the, you know, spin the the slot machine every time There's not like, yeah, I feel like I I would want I I feel like for slice and dice, I don't want an item shop like sleigh the Spire.
41:22
I want something that's maybe closer to Bilatro or luck be a landlord where it's like a very light, a light touch of maybe some more options than just yeah, you have to pick one or random.
There should be a dice based option, a dice based shop.
41:42
Like put in an item and then you get an item back and you get to roll it three times and it's one of these six things or something you.
You turn the items to AD 6 and you have to roll it first.
Yeah, no, literally it's like here are the six.
It's like you click on these things, you can buy one of the dice, you roll it and you get the item that's on the thing or something.
42:01
I don't know if you want to lean into the dice based theme.
But or options between, like even just a simple like just to add like the nodes are all a, it's a single line of nodes right now.
But like if we broke it up into two 3-4 options, different lines.
42:18
And these options are maybe things that you either choose directly or that you can like apply a weight to a dice roll or, you know, to use the theme.
And then, and maybe these nodes then are like, Oh, this is the Wolf Pack.
This is the, these are the slimes and trying to like basically steer in a direction which is more geared for your archetype of a build or even just items, you know, maybe these items, you see an item on the map and you're like, I want that I need to go that way.
42:47
I think that would help tremendously with like because right now you, you like you said, there's how many items 400.
Like there's there's over 400.
Of them it it's just like so you can't have you have no sense of what you're about to get next and I feel like having some.
Of the plans.
That's the problem.
43:03
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
But I.
Don't care how you solve it, just give me some way to slightly steer my course in the future.
Is is there a risk of like 'cause I like, I think I generally agree, but at the same time, like if every rogue game had the the FTL style node traversal or like bilatro item shops, like they would all just be the same, right?
43:33
I feel like this game is is interesting with how like pared down it is and maybe maybe it is better suited on like a mobile form factor because of that.
Because yeah, I like, I don't know that like, I don't think this game necessarily needs a lot of story or lore or needs options for like map traversal or things like that.
44:03
That's kind of why I'm saying like, I don't care what the form that you give it to give that that future stuff.
Like I, I kind of agree with you in that the IT is nice that you just your choices are you go down this line.
That's that's fine.
44:18
I just want at least a little bit more way of steering the build.
I think that's really what it is.
It's it's, it's not agency in like the path you're going, but the agency in like what?
What does your final build look like?
Yeah, so I think this, I think this brings us to curse mode because the reason why I think this is so popular with people who play slice and dice a lot is because I think this is where that agency comes from.
44:46
And it's less about like traversing like decision space of like I'm going to go left into the the Knoll camp and fight knolls here or right into the zombie camp and fight zombies.
It's more of, I think I feel like it's more subtle than that where you have your decision space of like, OK, I have these blessings that are going to give me a benefit.
45:13
How do I like make those better along with the heroes that I'm investing in and balancing out these curses that I'm picking up along the way.
So like blurs where you start blessed and then you accumulate curses after each boss.
Takes a long time, but it feels like like that that felt like it was getting its hooks into me.
45:33
And I was I had this goal of trying to unlock the cursed ultra mode where you do so by accumulating 7 distinct in all caps curses where which means you have to fight through seven boss fights and you have to accumulate curses after each boss fight.
45:52
And I felt like, oh, this is interesting because like even even at my skill level, like classic hard feels really hard to me because I don't know all the item synergies, but it feels like the curses and blessings I get more easily.
And like that balancing act there in cursed mode feels like something that that I can kind of grok a little easier.
46:13
And I made the deadly mistake of upgrading one of my curses, which means that is not 7 distinct curses.
So I had to play longer and I had to get like eight or nine.
And then I eventually died.
And I was just like, you could have you could have made this clear.
46:29
So I eventually unlocked cursed ultra, but it again, it was like I was I still felt motivated to come back to that mode to be like, all right, well, I'm going to get you this time.
Cursed ultra unlock the mode by by just grinding through.
And it is that one feels like very like punishingly interesting because you you accumulate a curse after each fight.
46:52
So you know the run is doomed unless you are one of these savant players.
But like, but this is one of those things where it's like, OK, I know, I know I'm going to pick up something that's just going to fuck me in the ass.
But how long, How many more battles can I win with this like a loss of weight on my ankles like that I feel like presents an like a more interesting challenge to overcome than surprise asshole boss fight at the end that just hard counters you.
47:21
Yeah, I no, I can see.
I agree.
Maybe Angie, you've been quiet here.
Yeah.
Well, I had AI played this game for somewhere between 6:00 and 8:00 hours and I had a completely a much shallower experience than the rest of you.
47:39
So much of this that we've been you have been discussing I have very little knowledge of at all time.
Just to give you a little idea of my experience.
So I beat it on easy normal.
47:56
I think the furthest I made it was like level 16 or fight 16 I should say.
Y'all are talking about the tears and everything.
I didn't even realize that I was like upgrading my party members.
I thought I was swapping them out with like party members who were better and.
48:16
I mean, you are.
Effectively so I I guess I, I didn't understand the fluff, but I didn't realize there was like a connection like, Oh my, my, my lazy.
Which real clear, Let's talk about, I want to talk about just the names of the classes.
You got all the classics here.
You got the hoarder, you got the lazy class.
48:32
You got the lost class clumsy.
I'm talking about the classic Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dabbler class or the Wall of the Trapper.
What about the?
Twin.
The twin.
Yeah.
Whose twin?
Who knows?
Very exciting.
He comes.
With his own twin.
Indeed, indeed.
48:48
So that's, that's a lot of fun, but I didn't realize that like, oh, you know, the, the lazy, for example, like tier one has a possibility to turn into, you know, like something, something else.
And like, every time I picked up an item, like I gotta tell you, 50% of the time I get an item and I think, Oh yeah, this, this seems OK.
49:05
First, first of all, I was never like wowed or excited by any loot that I ever got because part of the reason what, what we were discussing earlier, like, you know, I was not I don't have a very good sense of all the items because there's so many.
I don't have a sense of because there's, you know, so much content and I was not referencing the wiki mistake.
49:25
But like 50% of the time I would get an item and then I would realize, Oh, wait, it, it doesn't doesn't seem to do anything for any of my any of my guys that I have right now.
And I'll just have this collection of like random.
It's like shiny rock, the four leaf Clover and I don't know, the the the the blood marble and and it's like, and every time I'd get a new party member, I'd be like, well, maybe they just do something here.
49:51
No, they don't.
So I mean, a lot of this is, you know, is is on me, of course, but just just to, you know, set the scene so much, much more shallow experience.
That being said, fairly positive experience of this game, the as someone who doesn't quite, you know, understand the systems and everything, I kind of feel like the wealth of of modes is in some ways it kind of feels like a cheap way of getting out of having to like fine tune a good core set of modes.
50:27
It's like, well, here's just a bunch of them and like people can just kind of find whatever experience they want and that that kind of feels like the easy way out.
But you know what, What, what do I know?
What's it?
What's it the blurst mode that everybody loves?
So the the slice and dice subreddit likes likes blurtra.
50:45
Blurtra or no I think.
I think it is blurst, I forget.
So perhaps so perhaps this is a good thing.
There's just, you know, so many options in the community is kind of, you know, decided on one.
So so yeah, you know, it's pretty, you know, positive experience.
Like, I enjoyed playing the game despite their, you know, my lack of understanding.
51:06
But a real important thing.
I mean, this we haven't even discussed.
It's right in the name of the game.
It's the first word.
It's not the first word.
It's the 2nd.
It's the third word, Slice and dice.
Oh, all right.
It's right in the title.
Dice.
OK, we need to talk about the dice rolling physics, the animation of the actual dice.
51:27
These are wonderful, wonderful dice rolls quality, fine quality.
I don't think these are some of the best these six I've ever seen.
If I may really quickly, there was years and years ago, I remember there was a like a proof of concept for like a touch screen, a giant touch screen that you would play used.
51:48
The idea was you could play dungeons and Dragons on this and everything's digital and like you could move around your your tokens and your monsters and stuff.
And like, it was a pretty, it was pretty cool, except everybody got hung up on the fact that when you went to roll your little touchscreen D20, it was just the most God awful, crazy Roly Poly spinning D20.
52:08
And I was like.
That looks ridiculous.
And even now, this is an issue.
There's still plugs even now.
D&D Beyond, you know, official way to play dungeon Dragons digitally.
Awful, awful dice rolling physics, but they managed to nail it and it took them, maybe it took them three versions, but I, I really appreciate that and I commend them.
52:28
And I'm half joking, but also half pretty serious.
Like, you know, it's, it's, it's, this is one of the main things you're seeing on screen and it's, it feels good to roll them dice, roll them bones.
Except for when one dice gets stuck on top of the other dice and you kind of shake your phone trying to get it to lay flat and it doesn't do anything.
52:45
Oh, interesting, you act.
Do you actually shake your phone?
It doesn't do anything.
No, it doesn't do anything.
But your dumb monkey brain can't stop but help it.
Like, come on, just just get off the top.
Like a map, forget a way to you know, Telegraph what you know what what the next boss is or what the boss is going to be.
53:04
We need the shake rolling system for mobile.
And I will say that would look like an actual crazy person, but like just rolling my dice pull in my game.
The number of times on D&D beyond that I've, I've had a dice like get stuck in a corner and just like sit there like, well, I think that's a nine.
53:27
Like never have.
Well, yeah, other than what Colin's describing with the overlapping dice, like generally, like, I don't think I've ever had an issue with like how the dice roll.
And like, the more that I've looked into it, the more that I've realized, like the programming for that is really hard.
And that's, that's like another thing that I really like about this game is like an underappreciated aspect is how well programmed this game is.
53:50
Because this game has like quite the wacky modding community to it, wherein everything in this game is basically a text string.
And you can you can edit those text strings in really goofy ways where you can create new heroes, you can set how much HP they have, you can set what items they start with, you can set what color they have all that normal stuff.
54:16
You can set this game to be an auto battler, as it turns out, just with this spring editing mod stuff.
And so so this is called text mod where you can just like mod the game just in like a text editor effectively, and then share that with just like copy pasting these strings and just auto importing them from other people, which is like, it's a genius way to kind of like play around with the game's programming and just like just have fun with stuff like, you know, forget streak scoring class or classic unfair.
54:47
Like, yeah, I want to play as Brezhnev the mage and my party of Marxist allies to fight the dragon.
Like, yeah, sign me, sign me up for that. 100%.
Yeah.
There's all sorts of like wacky stuff, like even in the pace mode.
55:04
Also, you like, you can copy your game state into a text string and then share that out to be like, oh, well, I'm I'm stuck on this, this fight here.
I don't quite know what to do Share that text string out to the community that here's the sequence of stuff you need to do in order to beat this boss fight.
55:20
And you're like, ha, I've cracked the code.
This is how people are streak scoring.
Classic unfair.
But the yeah, basically.
And the, the the slice and dice subreddit also has this like, I think it's like a scenario of the day.
55:35
I wish this is another thing on my four point O wish list is I wish there was like a like an instant mode or like a short like sequence of battles for like a daily leaderboard of like, you know, fight through this and then however much damage you take is your final score, whatever.
55:51
But like the slice and dice subwriter has this thing of like, oh, here's like the puzzle of the day to go in and like work as a community to try to like unstick or or solve, which is very interesting.
And I believe it relies on this pace mode to generate it of like, ah, you have this battle set up.
56:09
You can import that into your game and like fumble around, like throw the dice and like play the game from that scenario, which I think is very, very unique and interesting are.
We good for ratings?
Is there anything else that any other major points that we're missing here?
Well, let's see everyone look over their notes here.
56:28
Music pretty good wait comments?
Oh yes, actually music there is the weird thing they're fleeing monsters flee if they run out of hit points or something.
I don't understand if like like do you want to turn on auto flee, yes or no?
56:45
Yes, the answer is yes.
And if you turn like, there's no like.
Why is it even allowed to be a a switch?
Well, my last run I was, you know, I was, I was trying to prolong the battles as long as possible so that I could like res this one guy that I had dying to generate mana.
57:01
It doesn't matter though.
No, it does.
It does because I found this out crucially where if you have like basically a party of all mages or people who don't do like direct attack damage.
If if you encounter enemies that like are immune to spells and you cannot use spells on them.
57:23
Like one of them in particular is this thorn monster that like it will do like 5 damage to a hero if you direct attack it with like a standard attack thing.
But if you are like me and are trying to break the game by running all summoners or spellcasters then like you physically can't hurt that enemy.
57:41
But it that enemy will flee.
I believe the the people angrily honking their cars on the freeway will correct me.
They will auto flee if your party has more.
Than 10 times.
Yeah.
And so like if, if for example, you know you're going up against.
58:01
This like this is a vitality then or something?
Well, this was this was quite, quite the wild solution here.
So there is there is one Summoner who I hate called Scroll Scroll scroll called Meddler who summons a skeleton on 1/3 of their dice rolls.
58:20
Yeah, they're really bad.
And I was like, there can't be any reason why this would be useful other than just making me aggravated.
And the and the subpertinent solution here is that if one of your all summoners is this meddler, it's summons an exploding skeleton on the enemy team.
58:38
Yeah, and.
You use that as like proxy damage to blow up those basically invulnerable enemies.
And so like so you have the flea system.
There is like a backup as like.
No, no, I'm not saying that the flea shouldn't exist.
I'm saying that it's dumb that they let you turn it on or off.
58:55
No, no, it has to be.
It has to be there because if you're playing it and you don't understand why it's running like you're about, you're ready to take the next turn and suddenly the turn's over and you didn't understand what just happened.
It's good to have like that experience once and then see the dial and then like turn like.
It makes sense to me why you'd want to have an explanation for why they're running away or.
59:14
You can just or you.
Just have a dialogue that comes up and says when enemies get to be less than 10, when they when you have 10 times more hit points than the enemies, they flee.
Yeah.
That'd be fine too.
Like there's no perk for actually beating all of them.
It's just like a thing that it's just weird.
59:32
I don't get it.
Yeah, I think some of the verbiage in this game, like I think the the amount of verbiage that's in this game already is a lot.
And I think for the most part it is very well done once you get it.
But there's a lot of very rules based stuff.
59:49
I I fear for whoever has to translate this game into another language because it's like when this thing does this thing, then this thing does this thing and this thing does this thing and it's, it's very sequential and programmatic and this and like all these dependencies and stuff.
Once you get it, like, OK, yeah, I get it.
1:00:07
But you have to like, like give yourself over to to like the the verbiage.
And I yeah, like the first time that I saw like the auto fleet thing, I'm like, yeah, I guess I'll turn it on.
I'm not entirely sure what it does.
Maybe more verbiage would be useful here.
1:00:24
Question mark.
But yeah, I think that like this, this game really shines when you break it and it's hard to know how to get those wacky game breaking combos.
I think at our current skill level, I think a good way to do it is maybe to to like beat or like playthrough run on easy mode, playthrough run on normal and then maybe just hit that unlock all button if you're struggling.
1:00:52
And then go play heaven mode where it's just like you are just like rag dolling the game around getting your revenge of like, oh, Dragon's going to come and get me, huh?
Well, not this time, you know, throttling by the neck kind of gameplay.
And I feel like once you get a few of those, like, OK, I finally got my revenge on the game systems a few times.
1:01:14
Then it feels like you are you are then graduated up to taking on hard, unfair or cursed modes from then on.
Because I I feel like once you know how to break the game systems, that's where the the fun factor comes in for classic, hard, classic unfair, cursed to find that survival fun in a way.
1:01:38
I will say.
Yeah, yeah.
The, but yeah, the music, the music is all it's, it's all like prearranged stuff.
But I think it it's, it's a a good playlist.
I've had it like running in the background of my head while I'm making dinner or something.
It's just like, it'll just pop into my head.
Like that's fun.
1:01:54
I think the, the pixel art in this game is, is done really well.
Yeah.
Yeah, game looks good, absolutely.
Y'all are nuts.
Returning, leaving the music on I I say this every time because what you do is you turn the music on or off, and then you put Seinfeld or, you know, some other show on the other half of your screen.
1:02:10
Because the game does need more slap bass soundtrack too.
Yeah, well, if you could, you know what you could do?
Yeah, you could mod it to be on the Seinfeld.
Part quick, let's start editing those strings.
Come on.
And the last boss would be Newman, of course.
Yeah, let's jump into rankings.
1:02:30
Andrew kick us off with with rankings here.
All right, let's see.
I think I described myself at the beginning as Andrew the slicer dicer Meister Harshman and and it has been revealed that I am in fact only a slicer dicer shyster.
1:02:47
I'm not very good at this game, but I I had a pretty good time with it.
I would, you know, I guess give it a sort of recommendation to most the average gamer, like, you know, sure, give it, give it a go if you but I would, but I'd spend about 10 minutes talking about how great the the nice physics are.
1:03:08
So for me personally, it's it was kind of, I don't know, a, you know, slightly above average experience And let's see, it's coming in at #13 out of 27 games on my list.
1:03:26
So it's in the top half of the rankings.
Slice and dice, fun pun name.
I like it.
What's your rating?
Oh I you know how my rankings are rating 5.5?
What do the numbers mean?
1:03:42
Will you're up next with your number.
Right to the point here, it's a 7.5 game.
It's a it's a decent game.
I in I could see like I I any game that like has me staying up past my, you know, my bedtime.
Essentially, That's that's that's doing something.
1:03:58
Let's let's get into the seven at least sevens.
I I had it 7 initially.
I feel like it's somewhere between because of the like the games I have that are sevens and seven point fives.
It's like, well, it's a little better than these.
It's worse than these, but the fact that I didn't get a spreadsheet out, it means a lot.
1:04:14
It means that it cannot be an 8 unless I get a spreadsheet out unless it really compels me.
But I think that the, the, the two hour, you know, and in some cases longer if you have to like look things up and be like, well, let me really scratch my beard about this.
I just can't be, I can't be doing 2 hours.
And and the fact there's no, it's just all cognitive load.
1:04:33
I guess you could say that's like a chest puzzle, but I'm do like 50 chest puzzles in a row.
I do like 3 and so yeah, there needs to be the the town experience, the the respites and so, but still, like I, I did I tremendous amount of items and variation and I can see why people get super into it.
1:04:50
And I can see, you know, trapped on a desert island with this game.
I'm going to have an OK time, you know, for a long time, but I'm going to play other games.
Give me a choice.
Colin, I give it an 8.
I thought pretty good.
It's it's definitely got some flaws that keep it from being like more than that, but I found it to be a very good like I'm sitting on the couch just on my phone playing it very casual in terms of like there are many decisions to be made, but also it's just a linear thing that you go through.
1:05:32
It's a little bit frustrating if you lose at the end, but not like you, you haven't spent that much time.
I don't feel like you ever get like super, super invested and that's fine.
I really like the pixel art.
I just thought it's a nifty little game.
I think it could maybe you could get up to like an 8.5 if you made some changes.
1:05:50
I doubt it could ever be a 10.0, but it's it's a good game.
I like it.
I would probably be an 8 if I was on mobile.
Like I think I feel like if I was doing it like in that sphere, because the average is so much lower, I feel like this would just be automatically higher.
And I was I was playing between doing workout.
So I really appreciate the turn base.
1:06:05
Like I can just do a sets come over here and then like that's another thing that helped boosten up a bit.
I, I played in my car while I was waiting for the ferry.
And I will say that that was actually like quite a good experience because, you know, I had to every couple minutes move my like the car ferry line went forward and I had to like pause it and I could do that.
1:06:28
Like, it wasn't like Vampire Survivors where that felt like that would be an instant death move.
I could just, you know, move my car forward 15 seconds later go back to scratching my beard.
All right, well round us out here.
I'm going to give it 8.7 nestled on my rankings just behind Binding of Isaac and just ahead of fraternal.
1:06:48
I think these these are a slate of games that like feel good to play.
I don't know that I can play like a 40 hour like single sit down session of them per SE, but they're fun to play in short bursts.
Sometimes the randomness can kind of get to you.
1:07:04
But yeah, I think like slice and dice, I was a little lukewarm on it at first, but definitely grew on me over time.
And I could see, I could see like playing more of this throughout the year before our Omega Bowl tournament at the end of the year.
I feel like the, the drip feed of unlocks is like very, very well tuned.
1:07:25
I definitely felt like the fact that you can see like, oh, you have this upcoming achievement coming and I just got to do with these little things more.
I'm like, yes, I do I, I, I must master.
I must unlock those extra achievements for the thingies.
I this game is, is not supported per SE on the steam deck, but it's somehow plays amazingly well with the combination of like the touch pads and the touch screen.
1:07:49
It just, it feels like it was almost made for the Steam Deck.
I could see how, yeah, if you're playing this on like an iPad or a phone, it would be really good on that interface.
What else we got in here?
Yeah, like finding those broken combos is great, but I feel like the game needs to hold my hand a little bit more for how how to find those.
1:08:10
Otherwise, I'm just going to be watching 2 hours of item tier ranking YouTube videos, which I'm halfway through.
Yeah.
So I think like even after I put like 40 hours, 45 hours into this game, like I'm I'm still having fun despite A1 for eight on normal.
1:08:27
Maybe, yeah, maybe later this year I'll actually have a hard victory under my belt.
Wait, you haven't you?
You didn't get hard.
I beat, well I technically beat hard, sorry about that.
I technically beat hard by I don't know if this is cheesing the game but I did a choose party hard victory where I had all all house cats in one mage and the the trick with the house cats is like they can't level up so all of the leveling goes into the one character and I had a level 10 mage who who would do like 142 damage at once.
1:09:00
Yeah, that's not that's not going to count.
You say you say you won with a a childless cat mage.
Is that?
Is is you and I were the official actual hard winners.
Hey you.
Know I I think, I think you.
Smack Party.
I think choose party hard is a perfect.
1:09:18
I think all of the modes in this game are equally valid.
Well now the real thing is I have to be classic unfair because I only beat it on the oops all mages.
So now I have to see if I can prove myself as the true the true champion.
Classic is that's that's the true test.
I mean, the other ones are fun, but they're not.
1:09:37
They're not a a pure test of skill.
Oh yes, I rolled my random roles skilled me into another victory this time.
Haha.
Well yeah so OK so some similar games here for for something more to explore.
1:09:52
Dice games have been kind of gaining some traction in the rogue sphere recently.
There is something that's like halfway between this and Slay the Spire called Astraya 6 sided oracles that I played the demo for, which is very interesting.
1:10:10
It's very much more of like your dice.
Our cards question mark die in the dungeon is is very fun.
I feel like it is it is, I think more of kind of what we're looking for from slice and dice in terms of like node node traversal options and like Respite's from pure combat.
1:10:34
But you know, there's there's a little less going on there.
Circadian dice, which is is interesting for multiple reasons.
A lot of people are losing their mind over spell rogue, which looks fine.
Question mark.
Maybe it's just like, hey, what about sleigh the Spire?
1:10:51
But just all that just dice.
I'm guessing we talked a little bit about Luckbee landlord.
I'm throwing that in here because it it seems like, and it seems more relevant here than it does for something like Dumarel in terms of similarity.
1:11:08
So I think like all those, there's one coming up soon called Rogue Roll out.
Emphasis on the roll that also people have some buzz about, but give those give those games a look should they roll your way.
1:11:27
Let's see how many more dice ponds I can put in here.
Snake Eyes starring Nicolas Cage.
If you want to send in your DND dice related stories of the D20 getting stuck in the corner, you can do that at grogpod.zone@gmail.com.
1:11:43
Our Mastodon with me posting pictures of playing slice and dice on the deck on the Steam Deck with some deer in the background.
You can find that at Grog Pod, at Game Dev dot Place, and Grogpod Dodge Zone is where you're probably listening to this or looking at our objectively pure rankings and our data sets and all that other nonsense.
1:12:03
Grogpod Dodge Zone The website will.
What is the next game that you have slated for us?
Oh, I've got a good one in store and I know this because I've got 32 hours into it and it really it fits that to the category of we were playing a different game.
I started playing this one.
I'm like, I don't want to play the other game.
1:12:19
I don't know.
So yeah, this is I know that's Colin and Andrew.
You haven't played and and Scott, you've only played for an hour.
So you're going to find this to be a treat.
This is dot age.
It's going to be a a city builder, a rogue light city builder.
I don't think we've actually had anything.
1:12:37
That's it's that's, I mean, I think we placed like parts of like buildings and that kind of thing.
But like, I guess this is yeah.
This could play that one against the storm, which I yeah, I guess that is truly a a city builder, but.
Yeah, this is, this is a very, very different game in fact.
1:12:54
And that's really why I think it's going to add to this is that I don't think we've anything done anything quite like it.
And I think it takes the rogue concepts and it really applies it well here.
And this is a very light.
This is not at all a rogue light game or rogue like in the sense that yeah, it's not yeah, you're not doing movement hexes and then enemies moving with you.
1:13:14
It's but it is very fun and I and I hope you guys enjoy it.
I'm looking to try some of the other characters out in the second time.
Right on.
Well, that's gonna do it for for slicing and dicing.
Stay tuned for dot age, dotage, dot age coming up.
1:13:31
Dotage I think.
I think it's dot age, but I think it's supposed to be a pun on the village elder like dotage.
Oh.
I see.
But yeah, I think, yeah, I'm, I'm super excited for that one.
But yeah, it's gonna do us for for slice and dice and to play us out from this episode.
1:13:51
Well, don't despair, you're not cursed yet.
Listen to some some happy, fun, bouncy main menu music to reset your your roguelike palette before jumping back in for for just for just one more run.
1:14:50
The.
