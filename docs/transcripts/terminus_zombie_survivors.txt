The.
Greetings friends and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast where each episode we ransack the shelves of the abandoned video game digital distributor for a high value roguelike game and then rated against all the other games we have in our survivors pack sorted by value.
0:53
I am Scott Berger and like all podcasts hosts I am a mindless brainless rotting corpse that is joined in the APOC post apocalyptic hellscape with his Co host.
This is will the zombie in the quadrants of the map you never visited.
1:12
Hey, Andrew Harshman.
More like Andrew Rage virus man.
And it's me calling.
Unlike these other guys, I'm also a a zombie.
Classic, the classic zombie.
1:28
Well, it is a it's a Thrilla night with Terminus zombie survivors that we're covering today.
Originally released in early access March 1st 2021 and one point O just recently, August 19th, 2024.
1:44
This is APC exclusive so far as I can tell with the Steam and Itch releases.
This was developed by Korean Dejon Korea based Long Play Studios and Terminus rolls in on our data set of the 250.
2:03
Shambles.
Shambles.
It walks it.
It goes onto the onto the data set into the rankings 258 3289 total reviews so far and your average player of Terminus has about 10 hours of gameplay in it.
2:20
Take note, Will Colin.
On that.
Face.
You were disgust from.
One you have you have scrounged up a book titled One Sentence Description of Terminus Zombie Survivors and you only have one action point remaining to read it.
2:37
Turn based zombie survival simulator where you read books in a library and press space to figure out where the zombies are coming from, but not really.
But may I?
Not really.
That's how you want the conclusion of every.
2:53
Here's the summary of the game, but not really.
Well, you don't really ever learn where the zombies are coming from.
I I've.
Fairly spawn points according to Will, but I didn't know that.
They, they're just cropping up.
They're just spawning left and right.
I, I I have an addition to to give to this this one sentence description if I may.
3:12
This is a game that exists so that Will can act out his urban survival fantasies.
Urban based urban survival fantasy.
I you know what I would do really well in that in this exact scenario, yeah.
No, we as long.
As it's turn based.
And that is why if you.
Accumulate more than like 100 bullets.
3:30
You are like, you're totally set.
And so it relative to real life.
Oh yeah.
You've already won.
We're.
Talking ten 10s of thousands, I mean we.
Would have to accumulate other fellow survivors so.
Yeah, that's a big problem.
More than more than two.
3:47
Well, I've got at least you, Colin.
I know, I know.
You're a recruit.
Well, no, because I died trying to get to you.
I.
You know why for sure I'm I'm the I'm the athlete where I can just run real fast.
Then you know I can't carry things.
No, I I'm not even an athlete anymore.
4:04
Is there just what's the what's the most normal profession?
You see, the humans are already turning against each.
Other student maybe?
The the bookworm class that you can pick I'm I'm gonna sit here and read some books while the zombies eat me.
Yeah, I think this is this is a game that the description is its title in that there is a Terminus, there are zombies and survivors.
4:28
And as far as I can tell now, I didn't I didn't.
I don't know that I've seen everything and will will definitely correct us as we go along here.
But is that it like that that kind of seems like everything sort of on the tin where this game, yeah, like we've you know, we've mentioned it's a zombie survival game, but turn based and OK, here's a question.
4:56
Kick, kick it off.
Kick kicking it off right off, right off the bat here in order to do our end of season rankings that we do, I judiciously try to force these games that we cover into some sort of bin or bucket that, you know, like more or less categorize them so we can have them fight to the death at the end of the year.
5:18
I have this game labeled as a traditional roguelike.
Pretty accurate.
False.
Oh, false, but.
True depending on settings.
The the default setting is to allow as permadef is off.
True.
With permitted on then yeah there's no.
5:37
But the only meta progression that helps you is when you start the game and you have many runs completed.
Then you get to select very high tier perks for your dude.
I think 25 points or something to the point system.
Good point or good things cost more and at some point you can like activate very useful perks that you don't get access to early on.
6:01
So in that sense it's not a true, if we recall the from the definition, I believe it was that each run is started, you know, pretty much equal to all the runs.
That's something where that is violated with this meta progression.
I do not find that well yeah, that's true.
6:18
Also, I did not find that the you get reloaded after you die thing did not particularly help me.
It just meant that I died over and over again on the same day because I died from either like starvation or being surrounded by zombies in a way that was unavoidable.
6:38
It's almost like when you die, like just before a quick save and then you just, oh, you quick load it and then your oh, Master Chief is still falling down that Canyon again.
Oops.
Oh well, But yeah, like I, I was on the fence of like, well, OK, is this isn't a a well, clearly it's not a platformer.
6:58
It's not a shooter game.
It could be a top down shooter, maybe.
It's not a solo dev game.
It's definitely not a deck.
Builder.
Are you sure it's not a solo dev game?
Yeah, it's well in, in that there is like 1 developer, but they're like that developer's not doing the art or the marketing or like handling like the entire operation just by themselves.
7:22
Also, I feel like that's a bad category.
In some ways, yeah.
I mean, they're all bad.
But that's that's the joy of of riling up all these.
Games, I think it is.
I think it's it's it's a traditional rogue like.
I think it's a it, it, it fits in the category in, in, in law, but not in spirit in some ways.
7:47
Because the other allegory to this game that famously almost made me physically I'll while playing, which I will say after playing this game in a good way, has elevated my opinion of is our when we did our cataclysm episode.
8:04
And like that, that is well also like a traditional rogue like asterisk in the sense that it's like, yeah, like the gameplay that you're doing is very traditional rogue leggy.
It's graphically presented in such a way that fits the the spirit and law of the letter more or less, but whether or not if that's an actual game question mark starts to spread thin a little.
8:30
So but yeah, Terminus zombie survivors, I thought was was quite the interesting pick because the second you boot it up, boom, unlike cataclysm, it is here is your game objective.
You are.
8:45
Wait, what does it say?
It says infected zombies are attacking people.
Surprise, your house is still safe, but electricity and water have been cut off and there are few supplies left.
In your last communication you learn that the surviving people have gathered in terminus, arrive at the terminus to safely to survive.
9:03
Pro tip, you can get a radio and listen to the broadcast or follow the railroad tracks to find out where the terminus is located.
And that's it.
Like you are dropped basically like into presumably your own house and your goal is to go from the South part of the map somewhere up to the north, find Ye Olde terminus and going from node to to node in what I originally thought was an FTL style map, which I was very excited by until I realized it's more of like a spider's web of of almost like municipal gosh, who was designing this city?
9:44
It's just a node based map.
Yeah.
I feel like FTL style implies you can't go backwards.
No.
Well, you can, but there's just like that, that big wall of like the rebels are coming.
You probably, like you, are not incentivized to go backwards.
Boss.
Well, no.
9:59
No in in FTL.
In this game, you are incentivized to go to wherever you want.
Yeah, which, yeah, I feel like is is interesting you are presented with.
I was.
I was glad Will posted his screenshot of exploring every possible little nook and cranny on his on his latest play.
10:19
Because you want a total volume of of locations by category, right?
Well, yeah, you have provided the histogram of.
All right, what, what, what town or city can you think of that has five electronic stores, 5 clothing stores, 5 churches, a railroad that goes right through the middle of it, 5 libraries, 5 pharmacies, 4 parks, 3 fire stations, 3 gas stations.
10:48
I could see three gas stations, three police stations.
Seems a little egregious, but it.
May be that like perfect like American city that Disney created you.
Know it's Seattle, obviously.
Of course.
Seattle, with its famous helipad and military base right next to the Research Center.
11:08
It's a video game city.
It's.
So I'm sorry, I might understand that every city that's generated has five of these locations.
It certainly seems is.
That is that the algorithm balanced.
From from these kinds of things.
But yeah, we'll.
I, I don't have the data to support a strong opinion here, so this is just my guessing.
11:28
The, the algorithm which produces the maps has things it must do.
And those things are the terminus has to have one way into it.
And that way it's connected to a railroad and that railroad can bifurcate or not, I believe.
And, but all railroads lead to the terminus.
11:44
And then with the things like the military base, it's always, there's always a, a checkpoint which leads into the military base and a, for the, the seafaring individuals, there's like a, the beach, I forgot the name, which leads into the Marina.
And so those are like that pretty much the only like 100% if there's only one route in sort of things and everything else is just like AII believe it's, it's set up as a grid where I don't know the number of rows and columns off top of my head, but in total you're looking at approximately 150 or so nodes.
12:17
And it's procedurally generated such that certain conditions are met where the proximity and things are all probabilistic.
But you generally get some number of, as was discussed, fire stations, police stations, a grocery stores, restaurants, etc.
12:34
I believe that they can range probably in volume from maybe zero.
I've not experienced zero.
I've not finished many maps.
I've only finished the one map, but I would imagine that it's probably 1 to maybe five with the median value of like 3 per.
12:49
Map.
So that's my my impression with a lot of houses, fortified houses and all the things following a distribution of outcomes very similar to open up any chest or any, any sort of a thing in the game where there's a, when you open up a bookcase, there's X probability of every single thing within it.
13:08
And and that's just kind of how it works for the map generation.
Now, when we did our Sleigh the Spire episode, will you got very excited about how how the map generation in that was a thing of beauty.
And of course this game, this game is very different in that it is a in like this game is very different from like a lot of the other games that we've covered in that it's a an open world survival game first and foremost.
13:34
So it's not really like you are progressing forward.
I mean, like the narrative thrust is that you are supposed to be progressing forward in order to get to the safe house or whatever.
But you are you are given the option to like to go backwards and you don't have like this, this like tidal wave of zombies or a rebel fleet to like keep you pushing forwards.
13:54
It's it's more like, oh, you are kind of like exploring the town and such.
But like, I'm curious, well, from your perspective, like would this game how how would this game be different if it was that kind of like Slay the Spires style, FTL style, Like you can only go one way, but like here's branching events sort of deal.
14:14
Half the achievements would be nullified immediately.
Well, sure, it'd also be a very different game, but would like yeah, I was surprised at how engaged you were with it, like.
It it so it with the Bartell's play styles if we can recall back to.
14:30
That's that's the pharmacy that you go and loot, right?
Is it, is that even the right name?
I might just be like completely now that Bartell, I feel like Bartell is the right name.
We can look at that, but I'm not going to look right now.
You said if we recall and it's clear that we don't.
So, so the the point is that some players, like different players have different needs with a game, like with every single game, right?
14:52
And within this game, I believe that there are multiple play styles that are enabled by having the go backwards sort of ability built in.
And in fact, there are many perks in the game designed to make going backward more efficient, such as right now when you are travelling between nodes, it costs a certain amount of action points to do that.
15:12
But if you get a certain perk, it can cost half as much or even less than that with other perks to travel between these two areas.
And so that makes it so that, Oh yeah, if you want to go back, it actually is much more efficient to do that after you have these perks.
And so it's encouraging, encouraging you in some sense to do this.
And So what this means to me is that if you are a base builder and you and, and you want to have a farm and you want to have a safe place where you can get water and food and generate a sustainable life within the zombie apocalypse, you could do that.
15:44
Now, why would you want to do that?
Well, there's reasons related to things that are achievement based.
There are also reasons that are related to being someone that I don't know, doesn't understand that you know that you have to finish the game at some point.
I don't know.
For me, the really the only reason to travel back was to maximize my odds at achieving achievements.
16:05
Achievements.
I'm very driven by them, apparently, because that's why I spent 100 games, 100 days in a game, one entire game to to make sure I got that achievement and in.
Real life.
Yeah, in real life, in the last two weeks, 100 days were spent.
16:22
So that's all I'll say is that I think that if you're a farmer, if you want to do some weird achievements, then all that going back does is enable a different style of gameplay.
So it's a diversity of gameplay.
And if you're someone who wants to race the finish, as I did initially, my first.
Game was like do whatever.
16:38
Next game was how fast can I do it?
Next game after that was can I do it even faster?
And so and so it's just like it.
There's a a number of different styles that this supports and it just means that there's more play through attempts and more fun to be extracted from the set of rules and constraints and the game components, game mechanics and game dynamics that are built upon this foundation.
17:01
And that ability to kind of, you know, move around and go back, back and forth between areas is very, yeah, a very pronounced difference between normal, traditional roguelikes where normally it's like, you know, you're just going down, down a level and maybe you can go back up to the previous level.
17:21
But in this game, since it is a grid, you can sort of freely move between these levels that are all sort of arranged on the same, on the same plane, which is, is interesting.
And I, I found it, I, I was expecting the game to be one giant map cataclysm style, or a series of, of giant maps.
17:42
And I kind of appreciated that it's breaks up the world into digestible chunks.
That was a welcome difference between.
I'm shaking my head against me.
I I completely agree.
That eliminates so much boredom that Cataclysm and other such games fall victim to because you just kind of like, oh, here's the point of interest.
18:03
And then you go to the other one.
There's not the three days travel between the things or the, you know, hours or minutes of just like all right, walking between long distance now.
Going to the overworld and just walking along the overworld screen is either.
Overwhelmed.
18:18
Or it's, it's actually like in Cataclysm, you are, you know, there is that much space that exists and you're actually running the distances.
For sure, for sure.
It reminds me ever so vaguely of fallout ones over world where you are moving around on a on a large map but it but in this case you're doing straight fallout one.
18:40
It's a good game.
Fallout 2 also good.
Ever heard of it?
With zombies and crafting and and combat and all that.
One thing I was kind of excited about so this game dumps you into what I thought was at at first like the the top down GTA game from like GTA one and.
19:05
Two GTA two yeah yeah, for.
Sure.
And I was like, oh, this, this will be interesting.
Aesthetically, very, very akin to that.
Yeah, I'm like, oh, like this will be interesting because like the amount of mayhem that you can get up to the up to in that how much mayhem can we get into in this?
19:21
And the first few playthroughs that I had, I was like, I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong here.
Because I think like again, to to preface this, like zombie games or maybe one of like my lower kind of genres that appeal to me, survival games added on top of that are just like another kind of thing.
19:41
And whenever Will is very excited to test out a new open world zombie survival crafting game, I.
Have days to die, everyone. 10 out of 10, Everyone.
Needs to do that.
I have to be dragged like the human survivor away from my family like nails in in the ground clawing away.
19:58
Please don't take me.
Please don't take me to be drag kicking and screaming to to play these games.
So I was actually like kind of pleasantly surprised at how.
It kept me engaged even though I'd like.
Didn't really have any idea what I was doing.
I was just like running from house to house.
20:14
Loot, loot loot, sleep, loot, loot, loot, fight zombie.
Why is my hydration so bad?
Oh, I guess I'm starving to death now.
That's interesting because so I'm the opposite.
I'm usually one of the people, I've got one of your legs pulling you towards the crafting zombie survival game.
20:32
And I didn't like that aspect of this at all.
And I think like it hurts me to say this, but I think it's because it was turn based.
I don't know if I like the combination of turn based and survival crafting zombie stuff.
20:50
I think it ends up driving my absolute worst video game instincts, which is just hoard things as hard as you can.
And that is a bad way.
Like my my players were like so slow because I'm like I need to take every single object I need.
21:08
I can't drop things because I might need them later.
Your optimization function needed to be updated quicker.
I'm not saying that I didn't know that it was wrong.
I'm saying that it hurt me and it the decision fatigue from deciding whether or not I wanted to take something became that that function was larger than the fun function and it was just like, this is a chore.
21:34
This is where we diverge completely because what this presented to me was the opportunity to solve like what do I need to?
Keep.
How much weight should I have in order to make sure that I have enough ability to run?
21:49
Like these are all very important questions where I'm like, well, do I keep every weapon I get because, you know, who knows if I'm going to fight a bunch of things?
Or is there some kind of combination of like, you know, moving a certain distance and making sure you have like, you know, a certain amount of AP left.
And like all these considerations were very they're unsolved.
22:08
And what's great, and this is this is really probably what made this game super fun for me.
If you go to the wiki right now.
There's nothing.
Is there even a wiki?
There's a there's a there's a no, I think there's a semi official wiki with like nothing.
And there's like just other random shit, which is just like, here is one person's take on things, but I haven't yet to see like a complete repository of here is every item.
22:31
What it does here are like strategies and how to do them and that stuff that I love to build from with no knowledge of what other people have done.
And so for me, from my point of view, this is a I need to find expected values.
I need to like when I enter a house, a house point of interest, what is the expected value of hydration?
22:52
What is the expected value of nutrition?
And like how fast?
So basically, what is the rate at which I have to progress through?
The nodes.
Oh boy.
Well, the game there is a fun.
Oh, that is fun.
We have.
Mastery Mastery's fun.
See, the The problem is I have enough trouble balancing my own nutrition in real life that like having to having to like figure out what combination of crafting materials I need to just cook a, a damn fish in this game is just like, it's like, it's, it's like another recipe I have to commit to memory.
23:27
And I'm like, I'm I'm already stressing out about what I got to throw into the stupid Instant Pot in order to get dinner ready.
Like it, it feels like this is the kind of problem that I have with crafting games in general is like, yeah, like the hoarder mentality, because I never know when the thing that I have in my backpack is going to be useful.
23:44
And I was trying to think like, what's a crafting game that I've played that I actually really like?
And I don't know if anyone remembers the, the 2016 FPS game Prey that should have been called Psycho Shock.
But that game has a really neat crafting system because like you pick up junk and you're like, well, I don't know if I'm going to need 25 wrenches right now.
24:07
So I'm going to decompose that into like little like atomic cubes of some, I don't know, color or whatever.
And then later on like, oh, I've got like all this stockpile of like raw material.
I can reconstitute that into a thing that's useful now.
And I think in like the zombie, the open world zombie survival crafting genre as a whole has that problem of like, you know, like Day Z or whatever, the one that we were playing where we were like raiding all those other encampments.
24:36
H1Z1.
That's the one fucking.
Great game.
Like or, or the Forest, like those games, I'm just like, like I'm, I'm just constantly collecting and hoarding stuff and like, that's like I'm that's the behavior I'm trying to eliminate from my life in real life.
24:53
Like I'm trying to not hoard stuff and I don't know, it just it.
There's something about crafting systems that maybe it's maybe it's probably just a me thing, but it just doesn't feel like it works in that in like the Rogue ethos.
25:10
Maybe I, I think it works for this game and what it's going for, but maybe it just, it's not for me kind of a thing.
I really don't like durability systems in games where you have to spend a lot of time thinking about that.
What are these planks made out of?
25:27
Yeah.
Ultra would thing in this game is optimization for durability.
It's like all of your food is slowly rotting.
All of your weapons lose like 25% durability upon hitting.
You're constantly worrying about finding enough tape to fix them or finding new weapons.
25:46
It it was it's like.
I feel like this is rapidly turning.
To it and And I know Will Will's dying to.
To, to, to.
Break in and say This is why it's a great game, but like there weren't enough, there wasn't enough something else to offset to drive me to do that.
26:06
It's like cool.
Well, Oh well, at least it has got really good combat to offset that.
It's like the combat is like there is zombie click on head, did you hit or not?
There you go.
That's it.
That's law.
That's the entirety of the Oh no, I lost 50% of my long spear durability fighting this one zombie.
26:27
I guess I'll go look through the closets of someone house someones house.
And see if they have any long Spears in there.
Well no no, not long spirit.
Like I gotta look for the planks so I can shave them into normal Spears and then I can find two of them with a knife.
26:43
Like, Nah, okay.
Well.
I feel as if this conversation is very quickly turning into a review of the survival genre in general, but unlike.
That in other games, that's the thing.
Oh.
You like drawability in other games?
27:00
No, no, this the crafting stuff, I'm OK with that.
I I enjoy it.
It's the all of that hard work.
You're like cool, I made this awesome thing.
Oh it's broken now I got 6 swings on a zombie with it and it's like and I have to go make another one or I've got to find tape to repair it.
27:18
Well that's why you combine your your pipe with your whittling knife at your crafting station to make a super pipe that you can then swing at zombie heads.
Pipe with knife no.
You're all you're all wrong here.
This is why you just don't craft.
27:35
Yeah, honestly, I didn't engage with the crafting at all.
It's not a, it's not a requirement in this game like in fact crafting is only a requirement if you want to do a non terminus ending.
Maybe, maybe my problem was that you ran it too many times too quickly and then you got onto alternate.
27:53
No, yes you will.
You beat it too many times before I even started playing.
So you incepted into my mind the idea that a non terminus playthrough was the better thing.
So I I got to terminus once and I'm like, cool, I did that ending.
28:11
Now it's time to do the like pure ending where you have to like build up an empire or something.
So I'm like trying to figure out how to make like a sustainable life in my zombie hell land where I'm like, I don't know, building a base or something.
28:27
I'm trying to like get stuff and I don't know.
It just did not.
It didn't grab me.
Which is exactly what zombies are supposed to do.
MRI folks, so am I.
Is it perhaps that the intended progression is that you're you're not supposed to be doing a ton of crafting until you what, like unlock and a profession?
28:45
Is there like a crafter profession, a crocheter profession, or something that makes your stuff better?
There are maybe there are two routes in my opinion, that once you consider it when it comes to crafting and and all routes that are related to this are non terminus endings.
And so just to be clear to the audience, not that they, not that we have anyone who is listening to this or cares about these five different endings, but they're five different endings.
29:08
At this point.
They're five different endings.
Get to Terminus is just like go from A to B.
If you can get to B, then you you win.
And that usually that's on the opposite side of the map.
That's the easiest one.
And it's just, yeah, no crafting required.
You're just like fighting some things trying to stay alive.
Other ones are take a boat and drive and I'll go out into the ocean, take a helicopter, fly it, take, let's see what it was.
29:32
We got to reclaiming every single territory on the map by explaining completely and putting a flag down.
Holy moly that sounds incredibly difficult and only the most skilled.
That's what the flag's for.
The flat, yeah.
29:47
It's why you have to put a flag on every single points that you can.
It's only, it's only positions that have buildings that you can put down flags.
But yeah, if you do that, that's the that's the hardest achievement in the entire game.
That's the one that I fucking wasted.
Wait, wait, hang on back in a second.
Flags like I've won like 10 hours into this game and I don't like, I don't think I've ever encountered a flag have.
30:07
You ever hit the crafting button?
Craft.
Flag there's a crafting.
Flag and I was like I don't understand why you would need to designate use a flag to Disney at it as your base.
Flags give you additional action points per turn well.
30:23
Good thing you're.
There on one location.
I'm imagining Scott in the post apocalypse crafting a flag out of his Children Of Bodom like fabric wall scroll from his dorm room.
We have reclaimed this block of the city in the name of humanity, but only after.
30:39
Midnight.
Yeah, I think like I think when I was reading through the different endings available for this game, I was also very excited because I'm like, OK, this is this is very interesting because you have your standard point A to point B victory condition.
You have your oh, maybe like it's not just like top to bottom, but it's like top to some like middle part of the map.
31:02
And you can escape by sea by going in like repairing a boat or something interesting, like similar kind of concept with the helicopter.
And then I I was looking through how you, you complete the vaccine for for like attempting to save this town and the like.
31:22
These these were all things that were like ticking the boxes of like, yeah, these were all things I was complaining about with Cataclysm of like, you know, it needs to have a definitive ending.
It needs to have some kind of narrative thrust of gold, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I think the more that you try to explore the systems outside of just escape by getting to Terminus, the more this game just becomes like a TDM factory.
31:45
Whoa.
Where, and I'm willing to be proven wrong, but my hypothesis is that, you know, like if if you need to escape by sea or helicopter, like you can find these like like repair books, like, oh, learn how to like repair this thing.
32:01
And then you go around the map collecting wrenches and stuff and eventually find, you know, fuel to power these things.
And then, you know, you're flying off away from the city before ultimately it is glassed by the government as it should be.
But like I never, like I never even found the, the wherewithal to repair of a car in this game because it just felt so I don't know, like like dragging me down from like either either.
32:30
I'm like so focused from like all the other Rd. games that we played.
Like I just, I got to get to point A to point B and the concept of like, no, my objective is now this thing I have to repair and, and like that becomes the goal and I have to like defend that whole area with guns and mines and stuff.
32:47
Like.
Verb Well, I don't know, like I'm like that crafting menu is way too big.
And I'm just assuming, you know, if you can craft flags in there, why not?
Anyway, it just felt like like such a wild perpendicular, divergent from like the the normal thrust of the game that it it just didn't grab me.
33:08
It it just it didn't seem like and again, like Will's furrowing his brow here.
So he's like, well, how could you?
Because this is like, this is where all the fun is and I'm like, I don't know, like running from node to node and like picking stuff up.
No, no, no, the fun.
33:24
OK, so as we all recall with with another fun game.
This time it's not a question, as you recall.
Principle, which is a remember.
Lecture 75 The chart which it which which?
Plots on the X axis your ability and on the Y axis the difficulty of the game and in this channel that extends.
33:46
In a.
At a 45° angle from the, from the, the center points we have, it's sort of a fun zone.
So what that means is that when the difficulty of the game is within the range of your ability, but it's not, you know, not overly difficult because that sucks and not under difficult because then it's just too weak.
34:04
Like when you're in that Channel, it's fun.
And so when the the fun of the game from from the perspective of new players who want to get the Terminus is that, Oh my God, I don't know what's happening, but like, OK, I just survived that fight.
I think I learned like how that fight dynamic works.
34:20
And I think I learned how to travel between points.
Oh, oh, it's dark.
Oh, oh, I can't see anymore.
I don't have anything that produces lights.
Oh, what do I do?
Oh no, the things.
In the fight are happening.
I'm bleeding now I'm bleeding.
What do I do about that?
Oh, I have to craft a makeshift bedroom.
But now I'm infected.
34:36
How do I deal with infect?
I have to go to sleep.
Oh, but if when I'm sleeping I get it's this chain.
Of.
It's a chain of urgency.
It's a chain of wow, I had this life threatening problem and I solved it.
That's what it is.
And it's in this, it's it's almost razor's edge where if anything goes wrong, if multiple things go wrong in a row, then you're dead.
34:58
And you just feel this pressure and you succeed.
And when you get that success, it's like, that's right.
I managed to survive.
I managed to get to the next point.
And if you win, this is very deeply gratifying thing.
I agree with that in the context of of getting determinists, and I think that like that at least like, and maybe this is a thing that like the game maybe deserves more credit than it than we're giving it.
35:23
If that like, oh, it has this big open world thing that applies to Will's sensibilities of like going from point to point and like a collect a thon and it appeals to like my sensibilities of holy shit, I got to get out of the city as fast as I possibly can and just like Sprint to the exit.
Like appealing to those two ends of the spectrum is probably really hard to do from a game design perspective.
35:44
I feel like the thing that might be missing is some kind of ticking clock where it's either like, and I know that there's one that's like weather dependent, but that seems kind of lame if there's and again, will jump in, but I'm ready to jump in.
36:00
The thing that the thing that I'm missing here that I was watching lots of a lot of Resident Evil 2 cutscene videos for was some kind of like super mutant like ticking clock of like either you have like a an 8 foot tall invincible trench coat wearing man chasing you, or you know, you have that kind of FTL style like wave O zombies that's encroaching across the map.
36:26
That like when you start a game, there's like two or three like dangerous zones listed on the map.
Like these are dangerous zones.
Like you go there, you're going to get face fucked with zombies.
Great, but like.
There we go.
That's the one I was not expecting from you, Scott.
You know we did the danger zone.
36:42
Don't go that's.
Kind of what it, that's kind of what it felt like when I was fighting more than one zombie at a time.
So like, and it feels like, yeah, I could just like kind of camp out at this gas station for the next 60 years if I had enough fuel and cans of beans to do so.
Did you see and though there that's where the the ticking clock is constantly is your your food and your hydration and all that.
37:03
But I want I.
Want, I want the zombies to start like growing huge claws and like leaping from building to building overtime and like becoming more like of a threat instead of like this one's a fat zombie, this one's a scientist zombie.
37:20
He's wearing a trench coat or he's wearing.
No, he's wearing a scientist.
Lab coat.
The trench coat would be much more interesting.
So like again.
Sacrilege, but I'm like be more like Cataclysm.
Dark days ahead.
That's the thing.
It had this weird kind of push pull to it where like the more I was, the more I was playing this.
37:37
I was like, yeah, I'm having fun with just this Terminus ending.
I just wish I could do this.
I just wish I could do that.
And then I was thinking like, Oh no, I'm just wishing this game was more like Cataclysm, aren't I?
And so I think like, we'll get the ratings when we get to it, but this game has actually like elevated my rating of Cataclysm pretty significantly as a result, not not to any fault of this game.
37:59
I think that like this game is, is good by itself.
But like, I feel like if this game's like UI and the cataclysms like game like gameplay systems were combined, then you would you'd be cooking with something there.
But I.
Don't know what you mean by that.
Yeah, I don't think the UI on this game is good either.
38:18
Really.
UI could definitely stand for an improvement.
Is that what you mean?
Just UI improvements?
I don't feel like Cataclysm nailed.
That I mean, it's better than Cataclysm, but that's you.
Don't think Cataclysm nailed.
It No, I don't know.
That's why we didn't.
Do that, Yeah.
Cataclysm.
Awful.
Awful this game.
Much, much.
More playable.
I feel like this reaches the the bare minimum which Cataclysm did not.
38:38
Well, I like.
There.
I'll I'll say that this game's UI.
Word You can't search in Wait Wait.
It's not how we get that you listed in the crafting menu.
Before we get to UI, can I can I tell you the two timers?
Yes, sure.
OK, the two and I and I, and I will caveat this by saying I completely agree that the third timer, which we've seen in modern games that works as even the core component of the zombie apocalypse survival, is the one that was missing.
39:09
But in this game, there are two timers.
One is cold.
You don't know this because you haven't got 100 days into this fucking game.
But it only gets colder.
Cold goes in One Direction and it's only it's just always colder and so.
I get to like minus like 3000° out.
39:25
I think by the end of the game, I was sitting around like 15°F was the, the, the, the temperature.
And so basically, if you do not have maximum cold adaptation skills, book reading essentially, plus all of this gear.
39:41
And even if you have all the good gear on, you have to like not have a backpack on.
You have to not have these other things that are useful because you need more warm things on your hands that don't encumber you.
And so you end up just being like, you know, sitting there in this, the Arctic environment, like all shivering around and just kind of like, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a very strange thing that it only gets colder.
40:01
But that's because you're not supposed to play this game for 100 days.
Stupid achievement.
So that's one timer.
And so if you don't have, if you don't invest enough into book reading or getting a close or learning how to repair your clothes, you just die from the cold because it just rains for HP.
And the other one is, as you mentioned, every single location has a finite volume of things.
40:23
And that's not exactly true.
But for what we're talking about here, like when you go to it for the first time and you rate it completely and you drain a point of interest of all the things, that's it.
That's all the things you're going to get out of it minus like some like sticks will form overtime, dead animals will form overtime, but that doesn't matter for this.
40:41
So basically that's you are are limited on where your food sources and water sources are until you get to a certain point.
So you have to have some kind of ability to create food and water from the void.
And that's just like a park where you can get water at the whenever you want and and food, you just use baits, which is based on rotten things, which you can get from anything or from your, the plantations that you can, you can create like a little farm system.
41:08
And so that solves completely this second timer.
I guess the third might be like gas, but gas isn't really a timer.
It's just a very nice commodity to have because if you want to get anywhere, walking sucks.
And I think that they, this guy did a very good job of illustrating the value of transportation in a zombie like apocalypse.
41:26
Because, yeah, you just sit at a gas station with a fire truck and if you pick the driver as your main profession and you get -75% to your gas consumption, you can suddenly travel in the circuit around to all the trading posts over and over again in less than one hour.
41:43
You stop, you start at one place, you drive all to all the locations in the span of one hour, and you can just do all your trading.
And that's kind of end game stuff.
But and to be clear, this is more of like a fast travel system as opposed to like like having the thing move across cost like the the node tile map that you're on specifically.
42:02
Right.
It's instantaneous travel.
You just like click, I want to go here.
You spend a certain amount of gas to get there and then all your dudes, if you have multiple dudes because there's a recruitment system which, you know, we can talk about that or not.
But because now you guys did the recruitment, I'd take it because, OK.
I recruited a nice athlete.
42:20
There you go.
Nice athlete.
Did you engage him with some thrilling conversation first in order to?
Yes I did just I clicked on him and then I conversed because you don't actually do anything.
You just watch them slowly tick down AP conversating with each other and you're like cool, I'm having such fun now watching them.
42:40
Over in an instant.
I mean, come.
On No, it's not over in it.
Did you recruit someone, Andrew?
I didn't recruit them but I I I sat with someone to try to get better deals on trading for their apple juice or whatever they had. 5 seconds, I mean maybe I had the wrong things on but to get them up to 10 try so you could recruit them OK. 5 seconds.
42:59
I guess I didn't.
You're just.
Watching it for like multiple turns.
Five hours.
You just sit there for five hours.
Talking to them, five in game hours.
Right, which is like probably like two or three minutes.
Yeah, so you're basically just staring at 22 sprites.
43:18
They don't even have like, speech bubbles.
They're just like.
Well, they do have a speech bubble that's like that, that's just going like dot, dot dot wait.
Yeah, I will.
Say.
Like I think, I think I like the the concept of, but there's no pay off to in that.
Like I wouldn't expect there to be like bespoke, like handcrafted, like, oh, let me just tell you about my back story here, blah, blah, blah.
43:42
But like, I feel like if the, you know, after you talk to someone, if you learned more, like I feel like this is a good opportunity for like a lore dump or like the real, you know, oh, Fred's library, You know, like having having some kind of more character to the houses, more character to the the libraries or police stations and like fleshing out like the identity of this town would be something interesting.
44:09
I guess it's not really necessary for what the game's going for, but this I feel like Terminus has like some kind of like missing flavor element to it that's just like, Yep, you're in a zombie.
Apocalypse.
Go for it, it's fast zombies.
It has that but.
Faster.
44:25
But it has very fast zombies.
But I forgot to mention, and I mean, you can stop me because we're on this other thing now, but the third timer that we wanted, do we want to?
Talk about that.
Oh, zombie waves expanding out.
You know, Seven Days to Die, I think is the the model that needs to be replicated in this game to increase the fun by a huge margin.
44:49
Timer's right in the title.
Yeah, seven days to die.
As soon as you start the game, you have a timer it takes down, and seven days you have a horde that's going to visit you and you have to either establish a base or be able to run for a really long time.
And so this idea of like the base being something you need to build up and get ready for these waves made it so that coming back to one location is very important.
45:09
And being able to like essentially create a home was like a really big.
Element of the periodic spikes in difficulty where you knew they were coming and you had to prepare for them in some way rather than just a monotonous grind where and maybe I think there are spikes in difficulty in this game.
45:26
As you Oh, and another game that did that perfectly, of course, was dot age as we as we know.
Try to imagine, was that done perfectly?
I.
Don't know.
And then and then you can get to the node that has the the rebel shipyard where they're constructing the Uber zombie and you can whittle it down to half health before you eventually fight the Uber zombie at the at the gates of Terminus.
45:48
Or or even or just to your point earlier about the forest and how you hated that game because you're, you know, an idiot.
But in the forest there are certain like there were like elite level monsters that occur and they're you you've never seen them before.
46:04
And suddenly you have these like strange.
What's it the I'm trying to imagine?
I know there's one that's like a flying sort of like combination of mutant arms that like is AV shape and it's attacking you and it's just like, what the hell is this?
This first initial shock?
You don't get any of that.
He's like, Oh, it's another one by one grid zombie that what?
46:22
Oh, this one has a helmet.
Oh, this one.
There should be one that's like, oh, it's the mega zombie.
Like, yeah, the mega zombie.
You must leave the map now.
Or or fight for a good reward.
Sure.
So anyway, sorry that was the 3rd timer is that I think that they they really need, I don't know if it's as a seven days to die sort of scenario, but I think that's base building.
46:43
There is no base building.
There is a you you can build some planters.
There's no defenses you can build.
There's no real base building at all in this game except for fortifying windows and doors, which is just to give them extra HP so that if you're sleeping, something doesn't barge in and kill you.
But there's no like hey, here is like static defenses or or anything like that.
47:03
So.
No punchy pits.
Well, like the people in the fortified houses have somehow figured it out where another new location you can come by.
And I thought this was kind of interesting about this game where you come across like these fortified houses that are all bottled up, razor wire all over it.
47:19
You can't get in no matter what, but you can talk to them.
You can say, hey, can I go on some quests for you and build up some trust.
And you can trade on that trust level that you build up with them for stuff like requesting ammunition, requesting light sources, requesting food, that kind of a thing.
47:38
I tried scrolling through the, the list of stuff that you can do with them and I know that one well, I think one of the endings that you can get is by joining said fortified house.
And is that just like by virtue of like, oh, I've I've built up the trust level to 9000 or?
47:55
Something 100.
OK.
So yeah, but like I think.
It's the easiest after terminus to do that one.
Yeah.
And I and I think that like that's an interesting idea.
If there was like again, some kind of like, I don't know, you are aligning with this fortified house, but by aligning with this fortified house, you're pissing off the other fortified house across the street and they're going to start sending mercenaries after you to, to take you out or something.
48:22
I, I know that this game has a big NPC update coming soon and I think Steam workshop support.
So of course, like that, that will take care of all the criticisms that we have of it.
They'll fix everything in the workshop.
They'll they'll make NPC interactions more interesting and then then it'll be a 10 out of 10.
48:41
And I'll finally get my golden plank infinite durability plank feature that I so desire.
Well, that'll that'll be great for the game.
And it it just recently went one point O right.
And so lots of exciting developments happening with this game.
49:05
The combat is it in it is not particularly enjoyable to me.
Like you'd never feel, I mean, maybe will.
Did you ever feel powerful playing this game or did you only feel like you were able to master your environment and like get away better?
49:22
No, I I felt completely powerful.
I was a God by the end.
I thought the assault, I thought, I thought the assault rifle didn't exist.
I went through 70 days in this game never having found an assault rifle anywhere.
I don't know if you guys found it.
But like, like Will's personal hell. 70 days without.
49:41
An assault rifle.
I know, right?
I don't.
I don't shoulder a rifle like then.
I have found hunting rifles in the game and and and like pistols, revolvers and then like never having any ammo for them so I always usually just wound up going with a knife, knife, duct tape plus stick most of the time.
49:58
That's a good combination.
Yeah, the knife, the, the shorts knife, spear, best bang for your buck.
And then here's why you use the knife down to 1% condition or, you know, sub 10% and you take that terrible knife that's all beat up, you stick it on a, a, a, a, a stick with a, you know, and, and with some thread and suddenly you get 100% durability and you're ready to fucking stab someone with that same knife over and over again.
50:21
So it's infinite.
Money glitch?
Based.
It's amazing.
Yeah, that's a good By the end of it, I I went with a fire truck.
The fire truck in the game has the second most amount of capacity, the most being the military truck with 1500 capacity.
This one had like 13164 I believe or something like that.
Because you're just using it as a giant motorized backpack.
50:38
Right.
And I looked at, so I've got a bunch of calculations here because of course I do about every single type of vehicle.
It's a fuel economy, it's capacity and then the amount of fuel it has to give it the total distance.
And essentially they all follow a very, a very strict curve.
And and you don't get a huge significant different like if you go with the 0.9 fuel economy vehicle, which is the best in the game, yeah, sure, you can move much, you know, I think about 20 to 30% further and in total, but you have 90, you know, total capacity.
51:08
So if you want to have end game stuff where I literally I literally had this fire truck filled to the gills.
I got up to 100% filled.
And I tell you what, when you right click that fire truck and you go to store inventory, there's a 2 second delay.
Delay when it comes to like viewing the items in there.
51:26
And that's when I was like, all right, this is a little bit annoying now because I was just none of my characters, like I said, three.
It was just like a, the main guy, the two recruits and no one carried any water or food on them.
Nobody carried anything.
It was all stored in this thing.
51:42
We would land at a place and then just swarm out in the first turn and kill everything and then come back and just like, oh, you need some water?
Here, have some have have your MP3 player.
Yeah, we're just like, I'm feeling good.
Yeah.
Let's go on and like, let's party.
On the yeah, we were on the fire truck with our Bible, MP3 players and soda pop.
52:01
It was it was it was like extremely overpowered.
It was overpowered for too long.
It was in that curve.
That's, you know, difficulty and ability.
It was in the oh God I have to wait till day 100 to get this achievement.
Sort of a territory.
And so you were able to just like roll up into into one of the dangerous zones or like military bases and just unload on all the zombies.
52:21
Because I was looking at some screenshots of people who are like going into one of these dangerous locations.
And you have just like tiles and tiles of zombies where they are stacked 4 on top of each other, all surrounding you.
And I'm just like, you know, if I had to like go and shovel like 75 zombies in the head one after another, this would get super boring over time.
52:45
Where is something that I can just launch a grenade launcher?
You don't have a grenade?
Grenades.
There's grenades, there's molotovs.
I did not get that.
You can make molotovs.
You can find grenades, molotovs.
Molotovs.
The fire damage over time is insanely overpowered because you just enter a map, you throw some molotovs, which you can, you know, gasoline, which is free, empty bottles, which are, I think that's a limiting resource.
53:09
And then like a rag, which is you're very, very free.
And so it's just like, yeah, you, you show up, throw a bunch of Molotovs and everything dies.
Everything burns as as that as has been said.
And so that's, that's like the de facto way of taking out like these big hordes then I'm guessing.
53:27
And so and so that like also shortcuts the need for you to open up the zombie killing menu, Swipe, swipe, swipe, move to next zombie, swipe, swipe, swipe again another.
Kind of, though from a distance, though it does say instead of walking up to them, you're just like, oh, you're over there, you're dead.
53:43
Yeah click.
But yeah, I feel like the this was another thing that I was kind of like do I do I need to go back to Cataclysm and give that another shot?
Maybe not, but I kind of wish that that like there was some kind of better balance here because being able to if.
54:01
If you if you must, you go play Project Zomboid and tell me if it's good.
I didn't get into that one, which is funny because it it feels like that's this game with Z levels and like isometric graphics.
You know the there there is a game when we get to the similar games list.
I was testing out Neo scavenger like this has certainly got some interesting elements to it where it's like a hex based overworld that's procedurally generated, but you're using like, I don't know, borderline quasi fallout like interactions with systems of like, Oh, I'm going to use my my engineering skill to Get Me Out of this, this bind that I'm in by jumping out the OR like rigging, rigging something to have this window open that I can escape out of or something like that.
54:52
It felt it felt more interesting decision wise in just like the moment to moment gameplay that I played for like 20 minutes than like the the kind of workflow that you have here, which again, like I think like for for rogue games in particular, it feels like that subsequent playthroughs should have a decent amount of variety to it.
55:19
And even though that like, oh, you know, like all the items are the same, sure, but like in this instance that I'm playing, the variety is is like a completely different play style.
I felt like I was like maybe falling into old habits too hard with each playthrough and that I was just doing the same thing run after run after run in.
55:38
In other Rd. games I feel like you you can't do that, but in this one it felt like I very much could just do the old reliable technique I was trying to.
Figure out what the optimal strategy was and then perfecting doing that.
Yeah.
What was that strategy?
55:54
I just run into a building looted for stuff.
Is there a weapon in here?
If not, run away.
This is so there's so many details.
They're glossing over.
Like so you walk, you walk up to a a window sill.
It's it's locked.
You've got 5 AP left.
56:11
You don't have any vision of the thing to anything on your left on your outside.
Do you, do you spend?
Do you do you break that window open, make a bunch of noise?
Do you wait a turn?
Do you like these are all things that are like strategically, you don't know when you first play play the game what to do.
56:27
And it sounds like you've got this mastered.
So you're doing.
Well, obviously.
Is there a once you have gained some level of mastery, are there multiple play styles that are encouraged by the game naturally through what you've found as you walk through the the the map?
56:48
Yeah.
What you learn is is you learn how far you can push it.
Initially you think, oh, no, my hydration's at 0 or it's getting low.
You don't.
You maybe you don't.
You're just like so afraid of 0 that you don't ever experience that or, or, or it's dark.
I, I can't go out in the dark.
57:03
And you start to form these sort of like here, you know, these heuristics that maybe Scott has formed like this is the best way to do it.
It's dark.
You wait inside you, you sleep all night, you read a book before the dawn and make sure that you're using up all that time very productively.
And then you go out, you know, and this, but that's not necessarily the best way to approach it, especially if you have alternative goals or different levels of difficulty or your character as as strengths doing different things.
57:31
These are all reasons that you would approach these scenarios differently.
And I think the variety because there's in total, I think, oh, I don't, I don't have the exact number.
It's something like a 12 to 16 different like characters with different abilities.
And most of them suck, to be honest, but they all they all definitely have their own like a a a perks.
57:49
The academic can read a book twice, double the rates.
The soldier does way more melee damage and just each one of them has, you know, this is a reason, Hey, if you go out there and you, you find this, this, you know, as a, as an athlete and you, you just, you can, you can risk running out into a dark area where you don't know if you're going to see a zombie because, Oh no, there's a zombie.
58:09
You have a button, which is just like, Oh yeah, I'm going to run a little further.
And that's something other characters can't do.
And so, yeah, I would say that there is a, while it's not maybe the most intense set of like abilities that's make for divergent gameplay, I'd say there are definitely different strategies.
58:28
And as someone who's I think played five different characters or six different characters and beat them so far with no losses, by the way, just, you know, no, it's a, it's a, it's something that I can appreciate.
And right now I'm doing like Apocalypse difficulty, the very hardest difficulty with the Soldier because I was like, the soldier is the best everyone, I think.
58:46
I mean, like it has the most melee damage.
It's like that's the most important attribute you can have and the hardest difficulty.
And it's very fun to be like, OK, this is the hardest difficulty.
Can I make it to the finish?
And I know I love this, this kind of test of a can I do this weird challenge, especially when there's no guidebook for how to do this correctly.
59:05
Yeah, I think I would.
I would probably generally agree with all those points.
Maybe it's just that like the the theme is is not like my most motivating theme to like drive me to do that, but I think.
Yeah, I thought I was ready to play another zombie game and I was not.
59:25
I was dragging my feet kind of like a zombie to play this game.
I only got like 3 hours of gameplay into it.
One easy win.
Woo, where all these issues you're describing what many of the issues that are being described.
59:43
It's like I had no problem with I was not hoarding.
It was just I'd go to a location I'm looking for I'm looking for food, I'm looking for water.
I'm looking for a frying pan maybe or frying pan and I'm moving on and the the process of like finding an efficient route and like kind of navigating the map.
1:00:06
Overall I found.
Pretty enjoyable.
My, yeah, I, I, I agree.
The theme I, I think is not super exciting, but this game's been in development for a long time, you know, it's, it's a theme that still is entertaining to some people, so maybe it's just not a great fit for us personally.
1:00:26
I want to come back to the UI because we kind of danced around a little bit.
I played like almost my entire play session of this game on the Steam Deck on the couch as as you do, And I think that like it was.
I was impressed at how how well it worked in that context.
1:00:44
Like I feel like this is a kind of game that's very mouse and keyboard, you know, cataclysm, you have like 3000 different key binds for every possible action you can think of.
And I think like, maybe I'm thinking of like combination of UI and UX.
But like, this game felt so much more streamlined and simplified in a good way for me of like, I like, I just want to move over here, please.
1:01:06
Oh, like this is exactly how much it's going to cost me to do so.
Here's how many points I'm going to have at the end of that.
Great.
I know exactly what the risk of me doing this kind of action is.
And yeah, I think that like the the fact that you can play this game like fully with a controller also very interesting and welcome.
1:01:26
And I feel like if this game like released like this, this would be a very interesting game to see like released on consoles even.
Because I feel like this this style of game is not very common.
And if you know, if there's a big pool of wills out there who are only playing on Xbox and they're finally have an open world survival turn based survival zombie game, I think this will be right up their alley.
1:01:50
Why is the will out there playing on Xbox?
That sounds.
Disgusting.
Why I Why would you put me in that scenario?
He doesn't have glasses and he has an anti Mohawk where it's.
Bold in the middle and.
Flares out the.
Eyes is a Friar Tuck haircut.
Yeah, I think that like, you know, the, the EU is not like super colorful.
1:02:10
It, it matches kind of like the bleakness of, of like the situation you're in, in a way feels very like like militaristic utilitarian in some sense.
But I, I kind of like what it's going for.
I think it was very easy to to like navigate through all the menus and stuff.
1:02:26
Maybe it's just 'cause like, yeah, it goes in the set set such a low bar for accessibility that like, Oh my God, this game has a, has a menu.
Whoa.
And I can press a start button and pause it.
Oh my God, Mind blowing I think.
It's a turn based.
1:02:41
Game.
Well, yeah, I mean, sure, but.
The crafting menu is not.
Alphabetized.
Yeah, there's a there are many there are many problems calling you go ahead.
Yeah, 'cause I.
I mean, I know a lot of problems.
With the people you're going to hear about unforgivable.
Yeah.
1:02:58
The the crafting menu where you can't just look for a certain thing.
Why is the flag?
The flag is at the very bottom.
It's just, it's, it's like grouped by like it's sort of like the developer thoughts.
And this is my me trying to like, guess what they're thinking.
It's like, well, you're probably going to do one of the things at the top first and then eventually you'll do the things at the bottom.
1:03:17
And so we're going to put all the like the you're going to want to craft, you know, some here's a spear here are like, you know, makeshift fishing rod.
And eventually you get down to the things down below where you're getting more advanced technology, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense and it's not easy to navigate.
1:03:33
And my main gripe, and I don't know how the developer didn't experience this if he played his own game, his or her own game, is that you, you have to do some really annoying patterns in order to play the game in.
1:03:48
In a like for instance, there is a thing on the ground over there, a plank.
Here we go.
At last, we're getting to it.
The plank is on the ground.
I want to go there.
I don't want to pick up that plank.
I want that plank.
What do I have to do?
I have to right click that blank key walks over there.
OK, great, that's all makes sense.
1:04:04
Then I have to tap the the button to open up the ground menu.
That's the second thing I have to do.
Then I have to click on the thing that was on the ground to put it into my inventory.
Why is there not a simple one action control right click, move and take, move and take?
1:04:20
And that and then there you go.
Then you got to go all the way up to the escape key or or or.
Bring your cursor down the 4th, the fourth thing you have to do to hit escape.
Yeah, this is a game about looting, and the looting is pretty annoying to do.
1:04:37
So I want to wait so in the cooking menu which is also the.
Ultimate second crafting menu.
In the cooking menu, when you hover over a food, it shows you what foods you can craft it into convenient, good, nice.
1:04:53
In the crafting menu, which is basically the same thing.
If you hover over something, it doesn't do that.
So I'm like, what can this bottle be made into?
I don't know, I guess I'll Scroll down the list and hover over everything to figure out if I might need this bottle for something later or do I need, Oh, I just needed to, I needed to to RIP my rag into more threads and then they'll be able to craft like but it didn't highlight so I didn't know that.
1:05:18
Oh my God, yeah.
I was 70 days into that, the game I just did before I realized you can take a plank and convert it into sticks.
That for me was not obvious.
A stick resulting from a plank.
I I don't know, maybe it's some people thought that was into it.
1:05:34
I I realized the rags you could tear apart into threads early, thank goodness.
But in order to, so I thought the limiting factor in this game for progression was finding sticks on the ground.
I was like, well, Oh my God, I go into this new place, oh, there's two sticks.
I can get two flags so I can mark off 2 locations.
1:05:50
OK, great.
Oh, no sticks here.
I guess, you know, and I, I really thought that was limiting factor because of that same thing that what you're talking about is like if we go to a crafting menu and I say I have a stick, what can I make with this stick?
It seems like or excuse me, I have a plank.
What can I make with this?
The plank is so.
It's, I wouldn't be quite as angry at it, at it, if it didn't show that there was already the ability to do that in the game, in the alternate crafting menu, which is cooking.
1:06:14
Yeah.
It's like you've already demonstrated this system exists literally within your game.
I could.
I could totally see that the the cooking menu was developed afterwards and then the developer being like oh shit I've created this really good system but it's impossible for me to like backport this functionality to the inventory system without like removing this one line of code that like the entire game depends on for some.
1:06:40
Reason why are you giving him or him or the benefit of down here.
I feel like this is AI have who do this by the way, I want to.
I feel like I I do you know this person, Scott, you know the details.
I.
Mean, I don't want to be sexist, but let's let's assume it's a man.
Yeah, I mean like I, I feel like. 95% of yeah.
1:06:57
Well, yeah, I.
Mean of of turn based survival zombie simulation games.
I think each one of those.
Y'all are hanging out with the wrong women.
So this, I mean the benefit of the doubt, because obviously it's a solo dev, so we got to give them every single benefit of every single doubt possible.
1:07:16
Or a near solo dev, I should say.
Yeah.
So this issue that exists in these different menus in like there's so many buttons and like mouse movements you have to do to do simple things to to loot and stuff.
For me personally also extends to just the navigation, like when you are running around in the early game and it's a relatively low danger type situation and you're mostly just walking around and and going to different houses and looting stuff.
1:07:49
Like just the whole process of right clicking, right clicking, right clicking and then you right click.
So you can't right click no more.
And then you have to press spacebar to like wait for the turn to turn over, except there's no zombies around.
You're just sitting there kind of like waiting for a few seconds.
That's like it's, it was, it was a little bit tedious and a little grading.
1:08:07
And I mean, later in the game, once you get a run going, it's less of a problem because there's more happening, which is convenient, but still kind of annoying to see in in a game that's been, you know, refined, been in refinement this early access, you know, process for for for so long.
And ironically, interestingly, I realized that this, this whole issue of all this, like, you know, extra stuff and the, the, the, the, the lack of refinement to the looting and to the crafting and to the movement is something that doesn't exist in a traditional, traditional roguelike game where you've got both hands on the keyboard and you have learned those controls and you're just clicking around and it just have this beautiful flow that you get when you are traveling around and, and, and playing and really embracing like a traditional ASCII based game.
1:09:00
So I, I found that interesting that that fluidity was lost with this, this UI change.
I don't think it's necessarily something that's inherent to like having graphics, having AUI.
It's just that unfortunately this this UI isn't quite optimized.
1:09:16
There's no like hot key way that you can all of a sudden have like your fingers split like in going on and then just like, and then yeah, like, yeah, goes to the shell and having like, you know, typing it like 10,000 APM to be like, all right, yeah, like this is how I'm assuming people play Cataclysm at a high level.
1:09:34
In the first in the 1st 10 minutes, like I rebound everything because I realized, Oh yes, the inventory.
Yeah, you have to like if you're doing a waz sort of like you're expecting that, you know, movement or whatever, you're over there.
Oh no, you have to inventory.
But that means it'll look down because the eye when you're you just you have to look down.
1:09:51
You're like, that's no good.
And so it's it's the middle finger on escape.
And then two was to open the inventory, three open the ground.
The thumb could hit C for crafting and then Z for sleep.
And so with this setup, you could do everything because you're hitting escape constantly escape the main.
1:10:10
That's the main thing you're hitting in this fucking game.
And so that was a great setup called.
Terminus.
I believe if they had the button, which was go here and do this, go to this closet and open it up and take everything that's in and out, regardless of like that would be one thing.
1:10:27
Or go here, open it up, make a decision about whether or not you want the crap.
Like I feel like those sort of things would have like streamlined this game so, so much because it really is a chore to to do rating at all.
Or I mean to dilute anything at a certain point because you're like, Oh my God, I have to click so many buttons.
1:10:47
Now, now is this workflow compounded when you have multiple followers?
Because if you, if you recruit more people, you know, you, you're basically just like adding more players to the game effectively.
And but you're still going through that workflow, right?
1:11:03
Where you're like, oh, this person over here is going to go and click, click, click, click, use up all their AP.
Then I'm going to move over to Jenny.
She's going to go click, click, click it and like fish over on this side of the map.
Then I'm going to move over to Timmy and he's going to go click, click, click, click, follow, like all those exact kind of steps that you were talking about, right?
1:11:19
It it from my point of view having, you know, two and three followers.
It doesn't really make it more of a negative, it just means there are more tactical decisions you can make because you can send one person into the darkness to the to the edge of your visibility.
1:11:36
Have them stop there.
Make an assessment about does this person have enough action points to engage the things he saw or do I need to move another person up because he get an advantage in moving multiple tiles.
More tiles that you can now see that you couldn't see before in one movement.
1:11:51
Less AP, then you have more AP.
So there are more tactical decisions with with more dudes and with three dudes you really have it.
Is it it?
It literally triples the amount of firepower that you have.
And that's what that's what enables you to deal with very large military base scenarios.
1:12:09
The Research Center the Marina does. 3 pawns take three times as long to play per turn, yes.
I mean, you have to, you have to tell them what to do every single time.
That just means that your, your, your conception of like what, what, what is happening is that I, I, I don't believe that it makes it like hitting space and waiting for things to happen isn't when the fun happens.
1:12:31
And so it just makes it so that you appreciate different dynamics of the game.
So I guess I'm not going to hold it at a fault for when you have three players.
Three times more fun.
Yeah, it's only, it's only more annoying in the sense that like each one of them needs to have water, each one of them needs to have food and morale and for you to micromanage like every few turns.
1:12:52
Essentially, you're doing three times the hold, right Click to drink the thing, right click the right, you know, you got to find the right food item with the just the right amount of satiation to eat.
And so it's just like very much a frustrating thing that but but you do it all at once.
1:13:08
So instead of basically a sequence which looks like, Oh yeah, they're doing a thing the and then you have the annoying.
OK, maintain your human biostasis or, you know, you're and then you have do the things again.
Now it's do the things takes a lot longer and then you have three times the length of eating, drinking, etcetera.
1:13:27
And so the concentration of those things gets more noticeable, I think, when you.
Ask is there a solution?
Does there need to be a solution?
Should there be some kind of NPCAI?
Maybe this will be addressed in that NPC update.
1:13:43
It's hard to say.
I don't think, I don't think an AI solution because if there's an NPC that's doing something stupid, I'm going to be very annoyed, much more annoyed when they're getting themselves killed, which is what NPCS do.
Yeah, it's hard to say.
I think.
1:13:58
I think maybe an option where the NPC you don't have to navigate or you don't have to worry about their food and water, as long as your main character has what they need on them.
So they're able to just move and do whatever and they just live off of your main guy.
And it's just assumed your main guy is chucking out the food and water that they need.
1:14:17
Of course, that doesn't handle the, the dynamic of the adrenaline injections that you might need to have or, you know, X-ray P like there's a bunch of, Oh yeah, that's, I don't have a solution there.
That's that's tough.
It during a Chrome.
Yeah, recruiting, but but why 3?
1:14:34
Why not 4 recruits?
Why not 5?
Why not 6?
I think that 3 is more than plenty. 3 is probably more than enough I think.
I think.
I do think that literally more than three would start getting it would bog down, I don't think.
I think it'd be diminishing returns.
1:14:51
I think we know from this podcast that 4 is the absolute.
Optimal number.
You're playing Rim World right now, right?
I am, yeah.
What's the difference between having many pawns in that game?
Oh, oh, obviously, because they they eat on their own right and they.
Well I mean it's, it's, I feel like it's true for every game though.
1:15:10
Like at a certain point rim world becomes less fun.
If you had 40 pawns in rim world it would be a chore.
If you have 60 people aren't like can she?
Didn't you install the mod to like give you more people?
And.
It it becomes more work to manage all of it.
1:15:29
It makes you appreciate your next run when you have only one or three guys or five.
Yeah, yeah, like it.
It definitely games are optimized around certain numbers of of pawns and if you make it so that you have a very wide range of people, number of like pawns you can play with, it gets more difficult to balance it.
1:15:53
And both terms of difficulty and in fun, like you can't balance it.
You can't have a game where you can have like a good difficulty curve at 3:00, but also it's still hard if you have 30.
The difficulty would have to come from a different place.
1:16:09
They'd have to come from like food and then you have to balance it around like 2 very different like sources of difficulty.
And if you are a single male Korean developer, which I'm pretty sure is what this this game is made by.
I looked it up.
1:16:25
That's a lot of extra work.
That's what like another weekend worth of coding it's it's fine you.
Know well this all gets back to a fundamental property of video games, which is this ratio that is the active doing and thinking and calculating about what's going to happen versus kind of the home base upgrading, making sure that everyone's OK sort of a phenomena.
1:16:45
And in most games there is a what's the ratio?
It's probably like a 5 to one.
Thinking.
Thinking to not thinking.
It's not thinking, it's it's, it's thinking in a different like terms like in the fighting, sort of like I need to kill this thing, but I need to maintain my HP.
1:17:02
It's like a very certain set of constraints.
You're thinking about A1 problem structure.
And then when you get to the town sort of structure you're thinking about, oh, here's the social dynamic here is the I need to get this stuff to make sure that these people are prioritized for these things and that.
1:17:17
And so it's a, it's just like 2, two or more because there are different ways of doing this, but like you need to have a variety of thinking modalities and I don't know.
And that's often represented as the you're out fighting versus in town.
That's just like the primary 1-2.
1:17:34
That's kind of like very common.
But I think that the ratios and the degree of difference between the modalities is a very interesting dynamic, which I've never seen any research on this.
I don't think game mechanics in general have seen much research, but I would love to see engagement levels based on some of these factors.
1:17:53
So we think about games like Diablo when we think about, Oh yeah, you're out there, you're in this mode, you're modality where you're just, Oh yeah, is this the elite I can take?
And are we going to be able to do this?
Let's move here or there or whatever.
And then you're in town, you're sitting there slowly.
1:18:09
You're you're rejuvenating.
Essentially, your mind is fatigued from all that clicking.
And you're like, all right.
Do I want to gamble this thing to get that thing or do I want to do and so it's.
Once your beard has been properly scratched, you can go back out there and click.
Right.
1:18:24
Exactly.
And within the talent, maybe you could argue there's multiple modalities here because you're like, well, do I upgrade or do I buy new gear here or do?
I and I feel like this is this is where this game is kind of like trying to have it both ways, where I think like it, this game would maybe be better if it focused on one versus the other of like, is your goal to get to Terminus and survive the zombies?
1:18:45
Or is your goal to save the town and base build?
I don't know that this game works by like I'm I'm glad that this game does have both of them in there, but it feels like they're kind of competing against each other where like if the game was just like your only goal is to just get to the terminus and survive.
1:19:04
And if you just like built around just having that goal and then maybe like, Oh, actually, you can't do that.
This run and your goal is like, Oh, I've I've got to get to the helipad instead and survive that way.
Like it, it feels like to me that there's kind of like a competing aspect of like it wants to be a base builder, but not really because it can't go that full extent just because of the limitations of the game design system.
1:19:30
And at the same time, like, yeah, like I've, I've, I've gotten the most fun out of just like beelining it to Terminus, but that also feels like it's missing something of like a broader world element to it.
And so I'm not sure.
I don't like, I don't know where the balance is other than just saying like, yeah, just take this game to like UI and UX and apply it to Cataclysm and boom, we're done.
1:19:47
We've.
Solved.
I have an answer for you.
Oh yeah, you're calling right?
But the the the answer is the goal is to finish the achievements, specifically the hardest achievements which you know some people.
Again, as I was saying earlier, only only the most skilled, proficient, genius players.
1:20:09
Well, you know, I it's it's true, but.
What you have done if the goal, the achievement was to to survive 200 days?
Oh boy.
Or if there was an achievement to have as much fun as you possibly could, well.
That one checked that box.
What the achievements are empty inside?
Well, what's an achievement empty inside like with with the rest of life?
1:20:29
I mean, that's why wouldn't I just live my normal life then?
I, I think the achievement, the I don't know, I, I think the achievements have to be actual like tangible things in in the game and not just little pop ups.
Like having fun.
I'm on the other end of the inventory.
1:20:46
Why?
I I mean like the didn't you do the scenario wherein like you had to reclaim the entire city or something?
Yeah, it's one of the wing conditions there.
There are scenarios which are different, but yeah.
I see it's a different wing condition.
OK, never mind.
Well then then that's great.
That's what I want got.
1:21:03
Outlined all the zombies.
Let's let's.
Break these games, are we there?
Oh, sure.
I mean, like any last words before the rating.
I know we're coming up at, you know, an hour and a half here.
Yeah, let's let's let's jump into ratings.
How about we have Andrew kick us off?
1:21:19
All right, well, over the weekend I had the the fortunate option, the opportunity to really get into the mindset of a zombie.
I was at the airsoft field and we played a a zombie mode where well, I made it halfway across the field and it's a big field before I got zombified, meaning I got tagged by the the zombie team and in 60 seconds I turned into a a mindless zombie.
1:21:49
The benefit in this game mode was that as is a mindless zombie, if you get, if you get hit in the head with ABB, you're, you're only dead for 20 seconds.
So in effect, you know, immortality.
So that's great.
And that was, let me tell you, pulse pounding.
1:22:07
I'm running through the woods with my MP5, doing my best hunk Resident Evil cosplay as I can.
And who, boy, when, when, when a member of the zombie team came sprinting across this open field towards me.
And I'm going from my gun trying to get him in the head and, and I did at the last moment, collapses on my feet.
1:22:27
Super exciting.
Basically, this is all to say, you know, it's not so much the the material of the setting that's that's an issue for me.
It's an issue that I'm an FPS meathead and I got I got to have that action.
I got to have that real time action for this type of a scenario for a zombie type video game or I need to have like really exciting like bombastic turn based combat like in like in last spell that has like just a whole bunch of crap going on, you know, magic spells and super specific special abilities and fancy animations and sound effects and and a metal soundtrack doesn't hurt.
1:23:06
So basically what I'm saying is this.
This game isn't really my type of game.
In fact, my my partner came up to me while I was playing this and was like, oh, what game is this?
She said, Oh, this looks like the type of game that Andrew doesn't play.
And that is generally true, but it was my impression that the, although this isn't a game that is quite suited for me, it, it seemed very competent and seemed like it was doing a pretty good job at at what it was trying to do.
1:23:36
And I didn't find it overly frustrating.
The UI issues that I was describing were more or less kind of annoying and and a little bit baffling.
Like why?
Why the simple thing wasn't wasn't better.
Anyway, this game's coming in at my new number 23 with a rating of 4.55.
1:23:56
And originally I was rating it as like 4 point something else a little bit.
I was rating it a little bit lower, but then I realized that would put it right behind Void Bastards.
And initially I was like, well, I think on average I have more fun playing Void Bastards.
But the question of, of, of, of how competent the game design is, is, is what sort of did it for me.
1:24:22
And Voidbasters like falls on its face in so many like super simple, basic ways that I just found super baffling in a lack of like boss enemies last, lack of boss and errors, etcetera, etcetera.
Whereas this game feels much more competent and, and, and complete.
So yeah #23 sorry for the low score.
1:24:42
If we were, if we're reviewing it based purely on like traditional, how good of a fun traditional rogue like this is, it would be quite high.
And because it is, you know, such a competent and, you know, well put together traditional roguelike, I think we'll probably see it in the Omega Bowl.
1:24:59
But I don't know, I haven't looked at everybody else's scores.
Colin, you're next.
I'm going to give it a 6.5.
It's dead in the middle of my pack of games we've played.
Boo.
Boo I I think I found this game too much of to be too much of A grind and there were a lot of there are too many like nagging things in the back of my head.
1:25:25
I am a chronic, like I'm a chronic hoarder in video games, which is very surprising to me in some ways because I'm not that in real life, but it's the like, and I think I've gotten better at it in video games.
But this game just brings out that worst part of me of like, I want to have everything.
1:25:45
I wanted to do all all the things, but everything's always rotting and my things are falling apart and it just kind of dragged down my fun having ability and it didn't have something else to offset that.
1:26:02
I got to terminus.
I enjoyed my first run where I won and then the void of like, OK, what now?
Like, they didn't have enough fun that I was like doing that same run again, but faster doesn't really appeal to me.
So I'm going to try whatever Will's doing, which is like trying to conquer the whole world.
1:26:21
And that quickly became like, oh, this is not enjoyable to me at all.
So I I get where the appeal of this game is.
I get even like optimized through it, but it just did not grab me.
So yeah, 6.5, no music arts, OK, but nothing crazy.
1:26:41
Yeah.
No music, I guess.
I'll go.
I'll go.
Next, I can't remember if there I I literally can't even remember if there were music in this game or not.
So obviously the music didn't grab me.
I'll go next.
I'm going to give it a much better score than Colin instead of Colin 6.5, I'm going to give it a 6.6 in that.
1:26:59
Yeah, I think like, like putting it on par with with Stacklands where like I think this game, like it felt it felt engaging to me in the moment while I was playing it.
But I don't know, like what was it?
There was a game that we were playing recently that was like someone had mentioned this is a game that's fun to beat exactly once and then never again.
1:27:19
I think that was a will review.
And I feel like that that applies to me here where like, yeah, it was fun to like learn this game to like beat it for the Terminus ending once.
And now that I know how to do that, I'm like, maybe I'll wait for like a big update or something to like really kind of spice up the gameplay.
1:27:40
I will say this game does have a, a soundtrack to it.
It's very muted.
It does kind of like fall into the background pretty well.
I think it's pretty appropriately spooky for the, for the time of year, the the Spooktober that we're recording for right now.
1:27:57
But I think that like the combat felt super samey.
It didn't feel like there was any sort of specific system here that felt like, oh, this, this is the thing that's like really pushing the genre forward and like super innovative.
Like which is fine.
1:28:13
Like not every game needs to be like a Titanic like reinventing the wheel scenario.
But like, I don't know, like it.
It just kind of like open world survival crafting games are not like my cup of tea to begin with.
But there was something about this game that like while I was playing it, I was like, Oh my God, I have to hide from the zombie.
1:28:31
They're get, they're right outside the door.
And I was like getting kind of into it and kind of excited.
So and I guess like the more that I was playing this game, the more I was like, maybe Cataclysm actually wasn't as bad as I thought it was.
So a I'm booping, I'm booping Cataclysm up from a 1.2 to a 4.2 and then yeah, giving Terminus the 6.6 for the moment.
1:28:56
I don't think that's why I.
Don't think you can.
I don't think you can change historical rating without.
Oh yeah, you're right.
I can't because it's it's chiseled into stone.
You're right, I can't do that.
I can't just go into this Google Sheet here and just type in a different.
Number I think in the the same way that slave aspire gets mentioned every episode.
1:29:11
Scott like mentioned by the way, yes, thank goodness Ding that Scott mentions that we can change the score at any.
Time after we had already mentioned slightest fire this episode so I.
I was aware of that.
I'm glad that you caught that as well.
Yeah, so yeah, I think like this game, I'm I'm glad that it's it's gotten to one point.
1:29:32
OI feel like this game still has more stuff to add to it with some content additions.
It'll be interesting to see what the what the big updates and like Steam workshop add to it.
But you know, for playing this game for like 7 to 10 hours on the Steam Deck, perfectly enjoyable experience.
1:29:49
Yeah, we'll kick it over to Will.
So I mispronounced it.
I think I said Bartell Bartle, taxonomy of player types.
That's that's what was the intended phrase.
And in each quadrant we have these socializers, the killers, the achievers and the explorers.
1:30:08
Where?
What am I?
The lady Killer.
Oh, sorry, you have the floor.
I'm steely.
The Zomboy.
With this chiseled, you know, no, I I'm a explorer achiever, and exploration is highly appealing to me, especially.
1:30:28
I mean, as I mentioned early on, this game, the Wikipedia basically doesn't.
This is not, this is not a solved game.
When you play chess, yeah, there's an engine.
It's going to tell you the exact perfect move.
When you start this game up, you have no fucking idea what the best thing is to do.
1:30:44
And that excites me in a way that apparently doesn't grip you all.
Where I want to know things I am so driven by.
How much food do I need to get?
How much water?
What is the rate at which I can travel safely?
1:31:00
What are what if it's this time of day?
Given these conditions, I I need to know this stuff.
I started collecting data on A at a pretty intense level.
I did not take this to the level of other games.
I have many guides that I've written for other games which are the most intense detail about the most of my the smallest minutia to optimize gameplay.
1:31:25
This game, I beat it early and easily and so I am not that interested.
And right now I must say it's 8:13 PM and right after this I am midway through a soldier playthrough of Apocalypse, the hardest difficulty, and I'm excited to beat that game still.
1:31:47
So I think with that I probably won't do it anymore.
So.
You put in 70 hours into I think you I.
Think you've earned 76 hours in two weeks?
So this is my full time job with this fucking game.
Many a night I've been up till 2:00 AM knowing that I have to get up at 8:00 AM.
1:32:07
So yeah, it has captured my attention and it has made the passage of time evaporate.
You, you know, cheeks, cheeks sent me high researcher on engagement.
Anyway, I'm going off on a tangent here My, my rating is 8.5.
1:32:25
I'm extremely engaged with this game.
I, when I'm playing it.
I have not felt the passage of time and I, I just, I'm very curious.
I've been very curious about how to do things, how to solve things, and I have made strides and steps towards those solutions and I feel very accomplished by having made those strides.
1:32:45
So I 8.5 seems about right.
I think there's a lot of room for improvement, especially with the UI picking up thing.
Doing multiple actions at once is a incredibly important thing for this game to do.
But I think there's a much more as related to the third timer that needs to happen.
1:33:03
And yeah, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm surprised that I'm the outlier here. 8.5 this is the, the second best game of the year.
My friends, we had Balatro and then we have Terminus.
From my point of view, every other game is that's, they're all, that's just the ordinary bullshit.
1:33:23
These two games have stood out in my opinion.
So there you go.
There you go, I guess this.
Is worst in two point O.
This is what's happening, Yeah.
So real quick, because Colin was pointing as watch similar games, I talked a little bit about NEO Scavenger.
I think will once you beat your current run with with that, I think you should definitely check out NEO Scavenger.
1:33:44
I think you would you would get some interesting enjoyment out of that.
Colin had mentioned Project Zomboid.
I don't know if that's actually a roguelike game or not, but I'm going to include it here anyway just because I think it fits the theme pretty well.
We talked a lot about Cataclysm Dark Days ahead.
See our previous episode.
1:34:00
Obviously not very good on the review scale at the time.
I think my my opinion on that has maybe changed somewhat, but I did boot it up.
I was like, yeah, maybe I should try it again.
I was like this interface I'm I'm putting a game on here that's not a zombie based game, but I feel like this is ultimately what every zombie having to rebuild like society type game evolves into is Unreal World which is a Bronze Age open world survival rogue like game.
1:34:31
I literally have that open in one of my tabs in case you didn't mention it.
Yeah, I feel like that that would be almost kind of like the sequel to this in a way of like society has crumbled.
We got to rebuild everything from the Bronze Age.
Bronze Age.
Bronze Age Finland.
Yes, there is a a game, I think I don't know if it's come out yet.
1:34:50
I think some of these are on the upcoming list.
One bit survivor has a very interesting art aesthetic.
Z zone, I think is supposed to be another wild top down game and they don't sleep.
I think that's the one that hasn't come out yet.
Are definitely wants to check out for sure.
1:35:06
And then to satisfy Andrew's FPS meathead mode dark wood.
I've heard good things about and I I think a game that kind of meets all these criteria of like open world crafting survival games is Don't Starve.
I don't know like.
1:35:22
Hey, there's a good game.
I'm giving that two thumbs up right now.
That's a nine out of 10 game.
Boom.
Yeah, so, so give those a look real quick.
Yeah, you can reach us on our e-mail grogpodzone@gmail.com on Mastodonic, Grogpod at game dev dot place and Grogpod dot zone for the website with all the stuff.
1:35:41
OK, all that out of the way.
Oh, I got a quick plug actually.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Go ahead.
If if I may on Thursday, October 24th at 6:21 PM Pacific Standard Time, I'm going to be on old Danny Rue 17's twitch stream.
1:35:59
Danny friend of the show Danny Rue, Danny, Danny Rue again twitch.tv/danny Rue 71 pardon me Danny Rue 17, Danny Rue 17 and we're going to be doing a a Pokémon smash or pass list, which is going to be a riveting time.
1:36:17
Going to be reppin the podcast and my views and opinions do represent the entire grog pod now right?
Now when you say smash or pass, this is relating to we know the attractiveness of Pokémon.
Indeed.
I see.
Yes.
Not like how much you want to like destroy.
1:36:34
Them.
Well, I'm sure we're going to be talking about a lot of stuff.
Destroy them?
Metaphorically, yes.
But until then, yeah, yeah.
And also previous previous episode guest as well where where Danny Danny Rue was on for our holo cure.
1:36:53
Episode yes indeed, which is save them fans.
Which is a great time.
Colin, you have our our pick for our next game.
Where where we blasting off to?
Oh, we're blasting off the heat signature, which I'm hoping Will is going to get high up on that list.
1:37:09
I think it's got a little bit of something for everyone.
I've already played like 10 or 12 hours of it.
And then I paused because I wanted to wait because I knew I was going to play it on this.
You know, I was like, this is we got to play this for the podcast.
It's got it's got everything.
1:37:25
It's not turn based, but you do pause and you beard scratch, you're flying around in spaceships, you're launching out of stuff.
You're you're pondering things, but also you're shooting at stuff.
It's it's you pause and then it's real time.
So it's got a little bit of everything for everyone.
1:37:42
I really enjoy it so far and I'm hoping everyone else will too.
Yeah, I'm excited.
Well, that's going to do it for our Terminus episode and playing us out from here is yes indeed, there is music to the game and it'll be playing us out here with some Spooktober ambiance that will be will play in the background for our our fortified haunted house.
