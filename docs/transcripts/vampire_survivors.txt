Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of the Grog Pod rogue like podcast where each episode we get surrounded by thousands and thousands of rogue like games but then have to choose one to add to our podcast belt and see if it reviews well enough to fight the megazord of grim reapers at the end of the season.
0:49
I am your head vampire host of the podcast Copper and in the coffins on this near infinitely big episode are my Co hosts.
Oh, Oh yeah, I guess that that makes me.
I am your survivor in a different vampire, in a different coffin, as it will, Wright.
1:07
Hey, and it's Van Hexing Andrew Harshman the vampire hunter.
Howdy.
And it's me, Colin.
I'm just a regular bat.
Yeah.
And this is joining us.
Yes, yes, well Woody Saskowski ano special Vampire Slayer.
1:24
So I want to start right now.
Is the is this game made by an Italian guy?
How could you tell?
Better believe it.
OK, I didn't this game, this game is so janky.
Like there's so much that like, I don't know what is some sort of complicated inside joke of like all the characters have like Italian names versus like something that actually has some kind of merit, like in reality, which is.
1:47
That half of the creator Castlevania references and half of it is like carbo macchiato unlock.
Yeah, and it's, it's very confusing.
It's the the list, the list of characters in this game.
There's like what like 30 at this point, like 30-40 characters to unlock.
And it's like reach an achievement to with this character and then I just have to look through the list 'cause I have no memory what any of their actual names.
2:09
Are like, oh, it's a dog.
Yeah.
That farts flowers.
Yeah, and the and the dog and the demon, they all just have people names like.
If we were European, I think we'd understand more troll touchstones and everything.
You know, the floral dog, Farter and all that stuff, I think.
2:29
Somebody told me if we were European, I think we would understand things better.
I would.
I would have many dollars fine.
Well, at the very least we don't see any dogs farting flowers.
We might understand the metric system.
But yeah, if if you have clicked on this podcast episode and somehow didn't read the title of what of what you're going to do, you're listening to the game that spawned a whole sub genre within a sub genre.
2:54
Vampire Survivors, maybe you've heard of it.
What's the name?
What's the name of the sub genre?
Or I guess the sub sub genre.
Well, from I guess, yeah, exactly.
Sure, because everything these days has to be a blank like and all creativity is meaningless.
But yeah, Vampire Survivors released, if you can remember this way back in the previous year zone, December 17th, 2021.
3:21
Early Access released one point O the following year, October 20th, 2022.
And this is a game that not only can you find everywhere, it's more of like, what can't you find it on 'cause it's on Mac, Windows, Xbox, Android, iOS, Switch.
It's on Tesla cars as of September last year, but I I guess crucially the one place you can't find it right now is on PlayStation PS4 and PS5 is coming sometime this year 20. 20.
3:51
Wow.
Well, they had to prioritize Tesla cars first, clearly.
Think of all.
Think of all the lines and lines of code they need to port.
Like.
Think how complicated this game is to port compared to Like a God of Wolf.
Yeah, I don't need.
To be able to point a direction and shoot.
Yeah, exactly.
4:07
Well I mean there is a lot of screen to fill up with like absolute seizure inducing sure.
Color flashing.
I, I once went to a week long game camp at Digipen, which is like the Nintendo sort of training college when I was much younger.
4:24
And we just like we were programmed a very basic game and I kind of made like a Smash TV Robotron knock off where we just move your mouse and sort of shoot your gun rapid fire in different directions.
And I couldn't sort of figure out how to continually like amp up the game.
So I they, they taught me how to do particle effects.
4:42
And just like every time you killed more squares, like the particle effects would just increase over and over.
And eventually, like, it got to the point where there was just sort of like fireworks shooting all over.
And I realized like I was totally ahead of the game on this.
4:58
And I missed my chance to become a millionaire by just having more flashing colors.
Like, gameplay doesn't matter because like the last, the last episode I was on with you guys was Balatro.
And like I I playing them sort of or talking about the back-to-back has made me realize the sheer power of having numbers get bigger and lights flash more.
5:21
And and.
Sounds get higher 'cause this this this does the same thing as Balatro when you open a treasure chest and like more treasure comes out.
Yeah.
Progressively gets squeakier and you're.
Like, oh man, here I'm going to show a picture of my phone to the camera.
5:38
This is like me playing yesterday and it's just a flur of colors and lasers and I'm looking at it on my phone in real life and I still don't understand what I'm.
Working at, we're looking at kind of like what it would be like to read an eye chart that was also tie dyed.
5:54
But you're like hanging out the side of a speeding car trying to read it like.
And you just.
It's pretty rough.
Yeah, and, and of course, that was, I assume, Colin, a engaging and exciting gameplay experience, eh?
It was I got over a level 200 which is.
Hey there you go see I what I find amazing about this game is that it so easily could be a disaster.
6:16
This is a recipe and it could so easily be unfun or just like too discombobulating to be enjoyable.
But it manages to, you know, strike a balance and they they found this this great sweet spot where it is still playable, but still wacky and over the top at higher levels.
6:37
Yeah, I think we have to give a lot of credit to we hinted at it before, but the Italian developer Luca Galante, who has has expanded from a solo dev effort when this first released into a a 15 person studio running Vampire Survivors.
Now real quick, some extra stats on here please.
6:55
But where I was curious like, you know, when we first started playing this game ages ago, you know, I kind of picked it up and put it down.
But I was, I was kind of amazed running the stats and seeing that your average player, Vampire Survivors these days, has about 50-6 hours of gameplay in it, which kind of boggled my mind.
7:13
But the more I play it, I'm like, OK, yeah, I can totally see it.
This cranks in on our popularity charts as the number sixth most popular rogue like game with 227,179 total reviews.
And then finally, Woody, you're gonna have to describe Vampire Survivors in one sentence before the Grim Reaper quickly embraces you at the 30 minute mark.
7:36
OK, walk around and watch numbers get big.
That's it, that's the game.
It's a 0.
It's a 0 button game like.
Well, you have to press a button to accept things.
That's true Lecter up and down is it?
I guess a a thumb stick is not really a.
7:53
Button.
A thumb stick is not a button Yeah this game needs to except like breath input so I can play it on my steamed I can breathe into the microphone to accept this.
This is.
Neural link would really, I think, work well with this 'cause there's not a lot of like complex inputs, you could really just be plugged into it I think pretty easily.
8:12
This game was.
Very well timed to sort of reach it's sort of a wave of popularity right around the time that the Steam Deck was coming out because this game was like very designed to be played in that way.
It feels didn't didn't any of you guys play this on a like it seems really weird to me to play this on a computer or ATV.
8:33
With a heat screen out.
Yeah, OK.
But since then I've been playing it on my phone.
Exactly what I think it's actually better on a phone than.
On a, that's what this is like the.
Opposite of James.
Cameron filmmaking where it's like, I'm going to make this on the biggest possible screen and like if you watch it on your phone, you're not getting anything untended here.
8:51
It's like, OK, this is basically designed to be played on a tiny square because.
Like.
That is what you are seeing.
Like, I don't know.
I think it's very telling in terms of what people are looking for from a lot of their entertainment that this game is as successful as it is.
9:10
And to be clear, like I like this game.
I've played this game a lot, but like this game asks so little of you.
It not that it's not like quote UN quote challenging, but like compared to so like the other games that I've talked about with you guys that really kind of as they go on, like you get, you have to be more engaged with what's going like the bosses get way harder in Dead cells.
9:38
Like I, I just finished a run of Balotrol where I had to literally break out the calculator to win by like 50 points and 'cause I didn't want to sell an extra joker.
But like this game, like you literally just walk around and like pick stuff up and I'm not.
9:54
Trying very low barrier to entry.
Yeah, I remember playing this game like upside down after I had like I was, I had like twisted an ankle or something.
And so I was like trying to stretch my ankle against the wall.
And so I'm like, hmm, what can I do while I stretch my ankle on the ground?
10:10
I know I'll play Vampire Survivors and it's just it, it's really the penultimate, like brain dead game.
Well it's not even like it's not even brain dead in the sense that like you, you lose brain power while playing it.
10:27
It's more like it's, it's such a Zen state game where you're like your brain is.
A nicer way to put it.
And I would say like deceptively, deceptively thinky as you get more into it because there is, and I'm I'm sure we'll get into this, but like item synergies and like arcanas and like you.
10:47
Know I, I don't know, I don't feel like those are necessarily thinky in the sense that like I never feel like I'm strategizing with this game.
I just feel like I have memorized a bunch of like item combination.
I feel like it's a parabola of, of thinking.
11:02
Like at first you're not and then you're like trying hard to figure out what the things are and then you've memorized all the combinations and you're back to not really thinking that much.
Or your meta progression gets so strong that you can just like at the beginning, like enemies actually kill you when you walk into them.
11:19
But after you've played this game for like 56 hours, as Scott said, is the average amount of time.
And like put all the little check boxes in the meta progression.
Like you can just walk into enemies and just sort of like eventually you just start healing more damage than anyone does.
11:34
Especially if you're the elderly fellow who smells of onions or garlic at all times.
I assume it's onions and garlic.
It's gonna.
Go.
It's like.
Dungeons and Dragons, they're always together.
Yeah.
I feel like.
So I'm curious, how many of us, in preparation for this podcast, started a new save game.
11:53
I I I made perhaps the mistake of not making a new save game.
I think it probably would have been.
This game's a worthwhile experience.
I didn't.
I didn't have the guts to actually want to delete my save game, so I was trying to figure out how to essentially like maintain my old save file and start a new one and that they do not make that very easy.
12:14
I restarted playing it on phone so I I mean this was during the eclipse so not that long ago so I didn't feel the need to remake that but I was starting to scratch.
It, I mean, it is a very, very different game, like starting fresh versus like being in the end game.
12:33
So yeah, I I'm still kind of in the old the end game, but I did realize, I think this is maybe DLC as they've released these things called adventures in there.
That's standard.
Yeah, no.
Oh, it's standard.
I just started doing the adventures 'cause I was like, I just beat it again.
And then I was like, all right, what's the adventure all about?
And so.
12:48
Yeah, which is kind of a nice way to restart your game without actually losing all your progress 'cause it's just like a it's like a capsule game built into the main game, but like some of the characters are removed and you're starting fresh from there and they're.
13:04
A little more yeah, it is a restart where where you still have access to all the things you've unlocked in terms of like the not the weapons and everything, but like that's a meta progression thing.
You can put points into reroll, for instance, which is something you have to unlock in the main game.
So I don't know it it was like a what am I doing here?
13:21
I've already beat like it just feels like this is a, you're really trying to squeeze out like a few extra hours of engagement from people where it's like, oh, OK, well.
But there's the deep lore, there's the, there's all the story of the.
Story.
There's no lore.
There's the.
One find out.
When the TV.
13:36
Show comes out the TV, it's getting ATV show at some point in the next two years.
Wait, nice.
Like, can't we play the video game adaptation of that TV show?
Wait, are you?
Are you you you are you messing with this Colin?
No, I, I I read that also.
13:52
Virus.
Survivor video game.
It works at the animated television series from Story Kitchen.
Oh man.
That oh man.
There's no other information about this, so I don't know if.
That is pretty ludicrous cause like this game very much feels like someone was wanted to kill some time and like pulled a bunch of art assets from the Castlevania pack and just sort of it's like what happens if you run around and then like wait.
14:18
Just hold on, hold on.
I need to, I need to read you this quote.
The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started in this little indie game that I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show, says Ponce Palm Clay, founder Gallant of Whatever.
14:34
The guy who made it, I can't disagree with him more.
I know he made the game, but the least important part of this game is the story.
He's.
He's not.
Stupid every act like it must be.
This game's presentation is so cheap feeling like, I, I mean, it's fine.
14:49
Like it's, he put, he put his time and effort where it mattered, but it's just like the names and like characters and the fact that this game is called vampire survivors.
Like I, I don't believe there's any piece of like theming that has anything to do with things being vampires aside from like it is pulled from the Castlevania art pack.
15:12
Like one of your one of your pickups is garlic, which is supposed to like, feel vampires.
Essential.
That's essential.
Grim Reapers.
They could be vampires.
Vampire Grim.
Reapers, you know, I, I feel like the at least the choice of setting and theme is pretty important.
15:32
I, I, I think it's, I think it's a very good choice.
Is.
What I'm saying?
All of the power.
UPS and.
Everything make make a fair amount of sense like you can you can ring so much like content and ideas.
It's like like let's.
Just say they're all ripped from Castlevania.
15:48
You already.
Know.
A dagger and a cross and holy water because you're like, yeah, I remember how.
This works.
I could know.
From any game that could be from Armored Core, that could be from, you know that.
Armored Core game which you bought Dracula.
I want to play in.
A big mech.
He's like what is a bad?
16:04
And then you just blew him away with a barrage of missiles.
Sign me up.
That does sound pretty good and there actually is a little bit of that in the recently released Contra DLC which I picked up and tried out.
And I'm happy to report that the gameplay still works in a sci-fi action, shoot em up sort of a situation.
16:24
Happy to report, happy to report.
But like, just for example, when, when it comes to like the enemy types, it's like this game has to have a ton of enemies.
And the choice of like Castlevania Hammer Horror, like Universal horror as like the general library to draw from is great 'cause there's just like so much content and there's so many options.
16:45
And they, they, you know, the game doesn't run out of monster ideas, say for maybe the floating eyeballs are a little overused, I don't know.
But generally speaking, it's like there's just, there's so much to draw from and it's like a great but.
17:02
By level 50 you can't even see the enemies, all you just see is screen effects.
Well, I mean, sure, but you had to play, you know, 10-15 minutes.
Or so that that would be great.
That would be great for the animated cartoon show, where like as the cartoon show goes through an episode, like more and more stuff starts getting on the screen.
17:20
It just becomes like an epileptic nightmare by the credits.
Oh lordy indeed, indeed.
So this How much did this game, how much does this game cost at the moment and how much did it cost when it first came out?
I'm going to guess $5 and I'm going to guess it's always been $5.
Talk about a bargain.
17:37
I it start it, it started at $3.
This, this I know.
I don't think it was it when it first came out.
It was not five, It was three.
I'm.
Pretty sure it's.
Free on the phone, but you get an ad you get in in.
AD stuff.
Wait, OK, here's a real question.
17:54
So when you guys die, do you get the option to watch an ad to get an extra revive?
Because.
I do a great mechanic.
Yeah, it is. $5 right now on Steam.
If you, I mean, you could just choose not to do that because most of the time if you're if you're dying, it's already too late.
18:13
But yeah, you can also watch another ad after you're fully dead and you can get a little bit of extra gold.
So, Scott, incredible.
Do you know anything?
Like can can you tell us the actual story of this game because it's apparently so important.
18:29
I think like so there there's lore with like some kind of bestiary that you go into the game.
You can see like the lore behind let's see, like the skeletons and I'm I'm just going through the wiki here.
18:44
I'm trying to find yeah.
And they're like each one has kind of like a little bit of text snippet to it.
Like effectively there is no story to it, but there's like there's fun like little flavor text here and there.
And I think I think this game is better without like any kind of story stuff to it.
19:01
At first I was kind of like, what am I doing here?
Like what's the point?
And then I realized, oh, it's just like watch number go up.
That's the point.
OK, great.
I've had, I've had many existential moments playing this game where I'm like, what am I doing here?
What's the point?
Because it yeah, it's just like just this morning I'm like, think I'll play some Vampire Survivors and I'm like, I should really go to work.
19:20
And I'm like, no, this number's getting bigger.
Well, yeah, so, so our our story begins a segment is that there is no story.
Just like, you know, Bellatro, you, you open it up, you hit the go button.
And I think like, you know, the the developer was saying like he wanted it.
19:37
He wanted to make it so that you just press a button three times and you're in the game.
And I think like that it's the whole menu system when you boot this game up to start with looks very mobile gamey, almost like in an off putting way you're like, oh, I don't know if I wanna get into this in a.
19:54
Very off putting way.
Yeah, like I, I feel like there's gonna be like in in game paid loot boxes and blocking.
Paid revives.
All that nonsense, but it there it isn't because it's like I was thinking about this earlier.
20:09
It's like, what if you had all of like, those uncomfortable elements of like, of like predatory mobile gaming, but they were used for the forces of good.
And you have Vampire Survivors more or less where, Yeah, like, we kind of talked about it.
20:25
Like, you start a game and you're just like, you pick a character, doesn't really matter.
And you are plomped into the middle of what I thought it the first time that I played was an infinitely big map, which is not the case.
And then no.
Like they're just quite large, but they are not.
20:41
You can get to the end of any side.
Or I've never been to the end.
Whoa, Yeah, they are.
Commonly big thing I could try to do.
And, and in in later levels, that kind of becomes a necessity or like maneuvering around this huge map is suits various purposes.
20:58
So you know you, you spawn in and the first time I played this I was like, what's the, what's the hook here 'cause it, it feels very slow.
The first time you play this where you have one character, you're shooting something very slow.
There's like 3 enemies on the screen, all lumbering very slowly.
21:16
And just to be clear, like the only thing you can do is move and whatever weapon you start with just auto attacks sort of in in some different direction depending on what it is?
And then the snowball starts happening where like the the Hall of the Mountain King song, it just starts getting faster and faster and the like, the number of enemies on the screen start getting more and more and you blink and oh, crucially, there's a timer up at the top that is counting up to 30 minutes.
21:46
Once 30 minutes hits, basically your run is over.
We'll maybe get to that in a minute, but as that timer is going up, it is just getting it to be a crazier and crazier experience.
And it is.
It's one of those games where for you know, when we picked this for the podcast, I was like OK, booting it up for the first time, yawn fest for the 1st 5 minutes.
22:08
The next 10 minutes were like OK, we're starting to get here.
And the last like minute of this game, the 29th minute of this game is like the most sweat induced, like trembling.
My hands are shaking.
I'm trying to dance my tiny little character in between this maze of humongous skeletons and undead nights and things on the on the screen to the point where like, you're like, you're holding out.
22:35
You're holding out for a hero for that 30th minute.
The clock strikes 30 and then the Grim Reaper shoots in at turbo speed from the side of the screen and then eats you immediately.
Yeah, in step fun fact about the Grim Reaper.
So for most things they've got, you can knock them back.
22:53
The Grim Reaper actually has negative knock back.
So anytime you try and knock it back, it actually pulls you in it in closer.
That's part of the reason it gets to you so quickly.
So this game, like people, I think this game is safe to say it, it exploded far beyond like what the developer had ever anticipated.
23:13
Again, similar to like Bellatro is like, yeah, I'll put out this, you know, game for $3 that I worked for a few years on by myself and it just became this sort of phenomenon.
And like, yeah, the idea was OK, I don't know how to make the game progress past 1/2 hour, so I'll just have death come and kill you.
23:31
Like people figured out like that they could kill death like in the game, like they sort of were able to glitch it.
So like death was stuck in sort of against some terrain and then they were able to like kill him and then the developer's like, OK, if people are going to do that, I will make that a part of the game.
23:51
And like, I think that's been a big part of this game's enduring success is like, because it is such a simple game, like the developer can just add is just constantly adding stuff and like new content can come out really fast.
And like, the game is very flexible and like it it, it is a substantially different game as you go on.
24:14
And like the unlocks get weirder and weirder.
Like there's a whole sort of arcana system that gives you like magic tarot cards, which totally changed the way the run is played.
And then like Scott was saying, if you sort of walk all the way around some of the levels, you can get these rings and different arms that allow you to become like super powered with combined with certain things.
24:41
And then you can like consistently kill death, kill the Grim Reaper and your reward is a new Grim Reaper kills out, comes out and kills.
You and this one is like not even it's not a thing it's just sprayed on the screen that just is like UN untouchable.
It's weird to me that like this game sort of has an like an end game.
25:03
And if you do like this confusing run of like levels in a certain order and it unlocks levels that only appear like once, but like every time you go back to it, there's I don't know, it's just I'm I'm just very caught up on the idea that like there's going to be a show about this game because it's just like this game so staunchly refuses to have any kind of narrative and it's just like, OK, we're at 1/2 hour show.
25:28
At the end of every episode, death just comes and kills all the characters.
Like that would be.
Awesome.
You know, if it worked for Itchy and Scratchy, it can work for the Vampire Survivor's TV show.
So.
Yeah, but like a a monster of the week, except you're the monster and you die at the end.
25:43
The the only explanation for like why this show is being considered to be developed is that they're counting on like the name recognition and like getting garnering views from like people being like, I know what that is.
I'm gonna watch the show.
Do we think that's gonna work?
26:00
Is anyone here interested in watching?
AI mean I feel like I feel like with with how much effort and style the developer has put into something that like on the face of it, we would we would like rank this like pretty low in terms of like a game that's like I'm I'm trying to think of like the things that rank really high for games with us are like thinking games, things that like are very turn based and slow and methodical.
26:32
Like it has all the things going against it.
And then like, there's just, there's so much like, weird, interesting, fun flavor that the dev has put into this that if it wasn't there, it would just see, see our commentary in our previous episode, Brotato, for like, you know, a game that's like, it's competently made.
26:53
I just don't think the aesthetic is really what we're looking for.
And this is like all kinds of weird aesthetic, like, yeah, it is.
It leans into what it is.
Yeah.
And so I think that, like, you know, a, you know, Dead Cells is getting an animated cartoon show.
So like, talk about games that basically have no plot, you know?
27:11
Sure, but like Dead Cells has at least like a charming a like a charming graphical aesthetic that looks, I don't know, to some degree like there there's there's much more lore built up in the world, I don't think.
Let me put this out there, OK?
Yeah, The the Castlevania, the show exists.
27:27
Have you seen it?
It's a good show if you haven't watched it.
Yeah, watch it.
Have you?
Seen it?
So.
That that has a story.
Like how good the game is, and the aesthetic of the game is almost entirely unrelated to how good the TV show is.
Arcane.
Excellent, amazing show.
27:44
Do not want to play League of Legends.
I, I think what's so surprising to me about the the TV thing is that it feels like aside from the branded recognition, it feels like you wouldn't have to license it.
Like the idea is so generic expect we are going to.
Make a film.
28:00
Right, right, right.
That, that I guess that's the key difference would be like with with Castlevania, it's like, well, you can draw on, you know, things like that.
And but it's and, and with Dead Cells, it's like, well, at least I can imagine what the script would be like.
OK, it takes place on an island.
OK, the main character is a guy with a flame head and, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
28:21
But yeah, well, I I wish him luck and I hope the even goes well and that the animation studio doesn't melt too many GPUs.
With all, you sound very sexier.
No, I, I, I just that sounded like I was shitting on him.
That'll that is.
28:37
That is very interesting.
Hey, I have a question for the assembled persons here.
Vampire Survivors.
We were just talking about it.
I've heard of it.
What?
That might be the theme of this podcast.
What is?
Previously I had said that, you know, I didn't like the term bullet heaven, but then I found myself using it and so maybe it's grown on me.
29:01
What what, what is the preferred terminology for a Vampire Survivor's?
Like, is it bullet heaven?
If is, is it one stick shooter?
I think so.
What do we got?
The the least creative but probably most prevalent one right now is a survivor like quote, UN quote, which I think is is pretty lame, but I think I like one stick shooter a lot.
29:22
Yeah.
I think that cause 'cause that gets across like yeah, that.
Different stick.
The whole point that like you're not using that other stick to to aim at enemies.
It's all done for you and you're just like maneuvering around which like, you know, there's parts of halls of torment that require you to aim stuff and there's a toggle that you can set to like add you just do it for me.
29:44
But like that aspect, I'm like, oh, I felt betrayed of like, oh, I thought this was A1 stick shooter and now I.
Have to you do have to aim stuff in this game.
That's not there are certain weapons that you can lean into.
I I do like that it gives you the option to be a little slightly more engaged.
30:00
Like if you really go into the directional weapons, you can be like, all right, I'm.
Gonna most of them are bad.
Aim my stuff.
But I clearly, I think I've, I, I'm playing it on a, a different, a, a lower level than all of you because I, I don't think I've seen too many screens where it's like illegible, like what's happening.
30:17
I do think.
I did fight that super grim Reaper with like the whole like boss segment 2001 a space odyssey realm and fight him which I have no idea how I triggered that.
Can anyone tell me how I trigger?
I mean, like all of the sort of narrative, like like like the way you actually sort of quote UN quote progress in this game is so, so opaque.
30:39
And that's the weird.
I don't know.
That's why I'm surprised to hear like that this game has sort of been taken on by this fifteen person team and like now it's been around for, you know, three years because it's like they've added a lot of content, but so little effort has been made to like create a sensible progression.
30:59
Like there is like there is progression, but like you don't really go from level one to level 2 and like they're like, OK, find this obscure item in this level and then go back to this other level and it will trigger this thing.
But like, I don't think the game gives you any hints of that.
31:16
This is very much like look at, just look it up on the wiki.
Like we're going to put stuff in, but like, we're not going to bother.
Like having you try and figure one of the characters you unlock by like typing in some sort of nonsense code in like the options menu that is just kind of a weird joke and they're like OK, well just look it up in the wiki I guess.
31:37
Yeah, I remember being very excited, like, oh, I almost, I almost got to the the final stage of stage 4.
And then Will was typing back to me the Discord and saying, oh, my sweet summer child, you have so many more stages ahead of you.
And I thought, well, well, what are you talking about?
31:53
There's only, there's only four stages of this game, but then there's bonus stages and then there's single, single stages that pop up once and then yeah, there's like, so OK, so yeah, I, I wrote down kind of like a sequence of what you're basically supposed to do here.
So yeah, like when I first booted up, like, what is, what is my goal?
32:11
What is my mission objective?
And like you're saying, Woody, it's not very clear that like, oh, the end goal of this game is to do this.
Like this is your like your focus for what you're supposed to be doing.
You know, effectively you're just booting it up to just slay monsters and watch number get bigger, which is clearly been successful.
32:30
But in theory, I think the the overall end game of of the game now is to beat the final boss that you encounter in the final level.
And the way that you get to the final level is collecting relics across each one of these stages that you unlock.
32:48
And these relics open up things like like adding, adding these new meta progression systems, adding like music players, basically they're, they're like a, a, a trinket defined on any given map that unlocks something permanently.
33:03
And it can be meta progression, it can be something else.
And in some cases that just involves you like walking to one end.
In some cases it involves you fighting a Katamari of of skeleton bones that just gets bigger and bigger.
33:19
And in some cases having to fight a aforementioned Megazord of Grim Reapers in in the 2001 Space Odyssey sequence.
And then crucially, making sure to pick up that relic unlike me instead of walking off screen.
33:35
And then realizing that I missed it and then the the death Sprite came in and got me and I had to do it all over again.
But but once you get all those relics, you know you'll have a final stage that you can go to.
And the spoiler alert, I believe the final boss of this game is the developer.
33:52
Have you all not done it?
What is wrong with you all?
I have I have not got it I.
I, I didn't realize that I was collecting relics.
To that end, I I just thought like, oh neat.
Will we haven't all put How many hours have you put into this?
I don't know.
It takes a fair amount of time.
34:08
Now, to be fair.
Beating the bone ball Katamari bone mossy is actually quite difficult.
Yeah, that total pain in the ass like that boss, I mean, I played it like a long time because.
I beat that level, but I didn't beat the boss on that level by the time I try.
By the time I got down there the boss was like almost as big as the screen and maybe it's 'cause I'm playing on mobile but like I literally couldn't hit him with most of my attacks because I was pushing him off the screen and he was getting larger or faster than I could hit him.
34:36
So he got to go in front of him.
You were clowning on the you were clowning on the on the directional weapons earlier, but like I was I was playing this game like mostly cheesing it with the the garlic man, my my buddy PO your.
Old man by the way, D tier like.
34:53
Legit, you are, yeah, but.
Early.
On garlic or PO.
Or both.
This is PO he's talking about, OK?
He's a very slow old man that can take only maybe like one hit.
But the the the key, the kicker is that you have a a you're you start with garlic, which is a circular damaging zone radius at the more garlic you get, it gets bigger and bigger, does more damage anyway it.
35:14
Takes a passive to evolve, but Oh my anyway it's.
Like I'm not I'm.
Like listening to a child talk about his his favorite juvenile toy.
No, that that garlic toy got me through like 60% of the game and it got me to the Bone Zone stage.
35:30
Great name.
And you know.
That's another nuanced Italian like concept, an idiom that you know, we us cretins over here in the United States, we don't understand it.
Should have been a poetry.
I'm sorry.
I'll be alright, Scott.
35:47
We keep.
Interrupting you see it got to the and this is this story is highlighting like how you know the game is more sophisticated.
Right 'cause I was just like rolling everything over with this garlic, like blastazone radius of my old man slowly caning at these skeletons and killing them.
36:03
Get to the bone zone and like, oh, clearly garlic will work this time.
And the giant skeleton Katamari, that's like rolling around like I can't get close enough to really damage him.
What if I switch to lots of projectiles?
And boy, this game has projectile weapons up the wazoo.
36:22
Where you got you got guns, you got axes, you got fire wands, you got like a machine gun level of daggers that you can throw.
And when you get all those cooking at the same time, that giant circular snowball of skeletons won't know what hit them.
36:40
And like I, I ran around the map, I collected a couple relics needlessly like a fool.
And then I wound up and I'm like, OK, I'm gonna go and attack this giant skeleton ball.
But I was playing with a turbo mode on, which still gets to the 30 minutes, but the clock counts twice as fast.
37:00
So really it's only a 15 minute run.
And I don't think I had enough time to really power up.
So I wound up losing that run.
But I'm like, OK, I think I've cracked it.
Go back to a full 30 minute session, Gives me the time to like get all of my power ups and ducks in a row and like get these synergies going.
37:17
And I just had this like, like completely chaotic, you know, playing this game on the bus on the Steam Deck and sitting next to a, a person who's never seen what's happening before.
I'm sure they're looking over and they're just like, what in God's name is that?
37:32
Just like pulsing, flashing the ball of.
Bones.
I mean, I do feel like this game accomplishes the same thing that like a bullet hell shooter would be, which is that someone looks over it and thinks, wow, you're really good at that game because, like, your hitbox is so tiny and you're like, yeah, I am, even though, like, you're just walking around and the weapons are doing really all the work.
37:57
I mean, truly, the pinnacle of Vampire Survivors is you can just set your phone down and walk away and you win at the end.
Yeah.
Which I have basically done like set it down on the counter next to me while I peed in the bathroom and then don't.
Try that on the bus though.
38:13
And then like 5 minutes later as I or well I guess not 5 minutes but.
However, many a a period of yes, all right, you came back.
And there's still this is going.
I'm taking all the winnings.
I do think that that is a little bit of a weakness of this game is like at the beginning it can be very slow, but then there's a real sweet spot between like minute 5 and minute 20 where you are collecting enough weapons.
38:43
And like I I think one of the best parts of this is if you level up a weapon fully and get this sort of corresponding passive item, it evolves into a new super weapon, which is always the most exciting moment is when you get that new super weapon.
It like just garages the whole level.
But once you actually like level up your weapons to the Super weapons, which sometimes I'll do like as early as like minute 22 or something and then it literally becomes well, I'm just going to sit here for 8 minutes, which can feel like a pretty long time.
39:13
Like I don't think that the game some I think this is an impossible game to get the exact right level of challenge because it's very like this game feels perfect when like you are barely getting by and you are just sort of, but it's very frustrating.
39:31
Like if enemies are just kill you because you're like, well, I couldn't have done anything about it.
I was too weak.
And it's also very boring if you are just mowing down enemy.
Like it's cool to mow down enemies, but like you do it for 8 minutes and you're just like, I am ready for this to be over.
And I'm not sure that this game quite figured out how to crack that code.
39:49
And I I also don't know how to do it.
Yeah, it's not perfect.
I can't.
I mean, I am complaining, but I shouldn't complain because I put 55 hours into this $3 game and I always have a great time.
But I don't, I never, I don't feel when I play it now that I am quite as engaged as I was when I played it in hour 4.
40:12
Where at?
I think it kind of depends also on what what your plan is too 'cause like I, I like one of my criticisms here is like, I don't think the game really tells you like, oh, you should be aiming for this to accomplish next.
I sort of had to do it myself.
But I think they're.
40:28
Yeah.
Like if you set out with the gold, like, OK, I'm gonna go and kill like this Grim Reaper boss guy for this particular level.
I know his like, you know, he, he shoots these big bands of horizontal and vertical like damaged zones across the screen.
40:44
So I will pick things deliberately that will target like auto target enemies.
I I feel like there's an element of strategy to that where, yeah, you do have to sort of balance those things and sometimes it doesn't work out in your favor.
And that's kind of the rogue Dom in a nutshell, I think.
41:01
That I am, and I'm sure you guys have talked about this so I apologize if I'm taking a dead or still living horse, but I think generally I am not crazy about games that have a meta progression that increases your character's stats.
Like I really like meta progressions where you unlock more stuff like, you know, like Gungeon.
41:24
Slave aspire sure to use that use this term.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, we got.
Slave, Aspire, Balatro, like any of that any cause usually the stuff you unlock is more powerful by nature 'cause it is more complex than the stuff that you start with.
But any game where you just like, oh, level this up a deal more damage, it is always I'm a little shaky on 'cause I never feel like I feel like this game is unfairly hard at its base, like with no no like built up bonuses of like starting with armor or something like that or like extra experience gain.
41:59
And then it just sort of progressively becomes easier as you get more and more of that.
So I'm like, I'm never sure if I'm really getting better at the game or if I have just put more gold into like leveling up my meta progress.
Totally.
I hear you.
Ideally an ideal rogue like you want to feel like, well, if I just had the skills, if I had built up the actual like skills, me as a person playing the game, I could have beaten it my first run ever.
42:27
But that's basically an impossibility in Vampire Survivors just in terms of the raw numbers.
Now, I'm sure there's some like, you know, cracked, you know, speed runner way to do it.
But, you know, for the average human, it's like, well, that's, that's an impossibility, you know?
42:42
But I I get what?
I get what you're saying.
Well you were gonna jump in about what what the non D tier garlic Strat was?
Oh yeah.
I'll give us you.
Give us your T no.
Give us your.
Top characters will Oh, sorry, go ahead.
What you what?
You level up like, OK, so yes, there's the meta progression stuff and that's to give you like, I think it's to amplify the feeling that like you are getting better, but really what you're the the skill you're gaining is like, oh, this thing is better than this thing.
43:09
And really only over repeated runs, unless you're, you know, cheating by looking at, you know.
Other people's tier lists.
Like you're having to get a sense for yourself of like, is garlic actually good?
I mean, like, in the beginning, yeah, it helps a lot.
By the end, they're crowding around and pushing in, and it's not helping me at all because they have so much health.
43:26
And so you kind of start to think, oh, well, in the long run, maybe I don't want that.
Maybe I want to reserve that slot.
And here's an important thing.
This game has six slots each, right, for the.
And so.
And that's like baseline.
And so some of the strategy is like, Oh, well, there's stuff on the map that's like, if you can get more than six, if you get fill your slots up first and then get those things.
43:46
So you start to learn like, oh, all right, these things are better.
And if I wait and pick up stuff later and kind of like plan my run such that I'm tagging these specific spots on the map at a certain progression points, then you can really optimize for an end game with the highest probability of winning.
44:03
And of course, if you know all this going into it, if you knew all the tier lists and all like of how to do stuff, then yeah, I like, I mean, for me, I'm remembered a lot of stuff in the past, but also I fucking cheated.
And I just like, I'm like, I don't care to remember what evolves into what.
And so like, you know, I, I'm rolling out the gate with like, you know, 3A tiers and two S tier things.
44:22
I'm just like, yeah, this is stuff that's available.
And if you know what's good, the game gets a lot easier.
And so I cheated myself, because that is the fun of the the fun of the game is learning what is better than the other stuff.
But I think that's kind of in some ways the game's fault because like, there's so much sort of progression or secrets in this game that you can only sort of figure out by looking it up.
44:45
And so usually if you're Google searching like Vampire Survivors, like Next Step or what walkthrough, like there's also gonna come up with a tier list and you're gonna click on that and you're like, oh, I guess I'll do that.
So I don't.
Do that.
That's the that's the lesson learned, right If.
You would have.
45:00
This game should have more stuff within it that sort of leads leads you to these directions and helps you figure this out for yourself as opposed to just naturally sending you online by being so opaque in its mechanics.
They give you damage counts by the end of the round and you can see that that S tier thing, it gave you a lot more.
45:20
It's hard to tell in game like what's actually doing stuff for you, but like it gives you a kind of a directional pointer of like this thing seems to be doing more.
And even though it's not perfect, because you might have that only at the very end and like, it's hard to compare because, you know, as the game progresses, like things get harder, but like it's in more enemies, more DPS as possible.
45:39
But it gives you, like I said, directional signals about like, is garlic good?
Which apparently, Scott, you know, failed that one 'cause, you know.
It's good at the beginning.
It's good at the beginning.
That is very true it.
Is, I mean, and it's good at the in the very beginning of a run if you are like, yeah.
But.
45:54
Also, so I have wait, I have I have two two criticisms of the game and one of them is well, I have more than two criticisms, but 22 little nitpicks of the game.
And one of them is that you can't see that damage output when you pause it.
46:10
You should just be able to see, OK, I mean, the thing at the end of the game just tells you like, what was your DPS from each of these weapons?
You should be able to see that at any point.
So you'd be like, OK, I'm at min 15.
What is doing my damage right now?
I don't know.
Here's my thing.
46:26
And the other thing is when you pick up evolutions, it doesn't let you go and look at the like the grimoire that tells you what the evolution things are.
What the hell this.
Point at this point doesn't matter because I have everything memorized, but for real long time there that drove me to the wiki like every choice.
46:46
And then of course, once I'm already on the wiki, well, I'm going to read the rest of the article about what the how good the the cats are and like, Oh no, this is actually an estimate.
Obviously you're going to get sucked into, you know, reading the whole story entry and like, yeah.
Exactly about how like.
47:03
And here's one entry more about the cat lady.
Yeah, Gotto being like, I think that the all I tell you in game is like might interact with pickups and it's just like that is not enough detail to tell you.
Like it has a unique interaction with these four, but not these two.
And like it's like and it gets stronger if it eats the thing.
47:20
So you want to especially stupid it's.
Honestly, I can't see.
What you half the time you can't really tell what's happening.
So like you hear the pickup noise and you're like, did it get better?
I can't tell because I didn't see what happened.
I have an admission to make.
47:36
I have no idea what any of the synergies like.
I don't.
I I just when I see when I see the tag that says evo, I go, oh, that's a good one.
I'll pick that one.
Sure.
I mean, that's.
But I don't know what they I couldn't describe to you like what what mechanically they do.
I'm getting a look from will bigger.
47:55
I think that's more like.
How well did you play this game?
Like what?
Like, it's like, you know?
60 hours it's chill I.
Mean like.
But like, I think there, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had, even if you're not even close to understanding the nuances.
48:12
Hey, Will, you brought something up that we talked about way, way back when we when we covered Brotato, which pretty deep storyline.
I mean, we all know the Brotato, he crash landed on an island.
He was stranded there.
He's the only survivor and he's got to fight until he is evacuated.
48:28
Anyway, we were discussing Brotato and something that we that came up was in Brotato we're disappointed to learn that you're stuck in an arena.
Whereas in Vampire Survivors you get to explore the level.
And I think that is a pretty, a pretty engaging and fun part of the game is traveling around and being in a stuck arena, I think kind of limits the game play.
48:52
And getting able to be being allowed to move around and pick up those relics and, and make limited use of the limited terrain is, is pretty key, I think, to this, this game.
And the game does a smart, you know, does there's, there's some smart game design wherein the levels are laid out in different ways.
49:11
There's a purely vertical level, purely horizontal level, etcetera, etcetera.
It may seem simple, but like it has a big effect on the gameplay and it's it's it's pretty enjoyable, But I like that sense of exploration in Vampire.
Survival and I feel like the levels definitely get more complex and have a little more personality as they progress.
49:30
And especially like in the DLC, I think that this has kind of a similar thing as what we talked about with Dead Cells.
Whereas some of you guys were like complaining as to like, oh, I've found this sort of random lure room that references this other game and it was, it's sort of this mixed blessing of kind of throwing out progressive content over four years of time and then sort of getting into it.
49:58
It's very hard to sort of mix what is in the base game versus what is in the DLC.
And like, yeah, for how opaque, like so much of the progression is, I think often things that exist in the DLC are sort of self-contained within with just those levels.
50:17
But like in the menu and stuff, it's all mixed together.
I just it it sort of becomes more unwelcoming to new players.
I think crucially, the difference between Potato and Vampire Survivors is that the, the waves of enemies that you are eventually fighting almost become the arena to some degree where like you're almost inside this living Organism where like you're getting surrounded on all sides.
50:43
And yeah, you have like the impassable barriers that you can't move.
But there's also elements of like, well, like, do I do I pick up the the the item that will like shoot beams out to like freeze people in like a like a like a line and then walk through that line of frozen enemies to safety.
51:04
Or like, you know, some enemies are weaker than others.
So like they'll die faster and open up like a little, a little maze like path within like this huge swarm of bad guys.
Like I feel like there's an underrated element of the like, yeah, the map design is, is interesting and different than just your flat Rotato stage, but you don't get that in Rotato.
51:26
Like it's just like all roughly the same kind of samey looking enemy that you're just kind of like running away from and you're not like using that morass of like literally like 10s of thousands of enemies to like navigate through in some kind of strategic manner.
51:43
I think there's like, there's like a weirdly understated element to that here that I find.
I find that I'm like actually like kind of strategizing around for the most part.
But maybe that's just 'cause I'm always picking garlic and.
No, I definitely had exactly that sort of thought process that you're having and and it's a great example of how on its surface it may seem like a relatively simple game, but it hides layers of complexity and interesting, makes you makes you think in interesting ways and have strategy.
52:15
If, if, if this game was one level, would it wouldn't fundamentally change the game play at all?
And what I think they've done by having multiple like, I mean, yeah, there's more vertical, more horizontal ones with like a little bit of up, but the fundamentally it's not doing all that much.
52:30
But it is it's, it's like it's this small thing that extends the the novelty of the game well beyond what you would expect.
I mean, suddenly, you know, instead of it just being this big open green area or like a closed brotato, sort of like arena, it's just like, yeah, OK, now I'm going to move mostly horizontal and I have to tag this thing over here on the far right, and then I have to go all the way to the far left if I want to get to the final unlock.
52:54
Yeah, suddenly it's still the same game, but it's just like, now you have another 10 hours of content because you've decided that there's this mechanic of the shape of the map.
And I think this is.
Really Entertainment Molt.
Right, exactly.
That's that's, that's what we're looking for with games.
53:11
It's like, how do you make the game that's fun forever?
That's the question.
That is like the eternal question for me is what is the the most fun game?
And, and the answer to that is, Oh yeah, you just keep adding content and having something that changes forever.
But what if you had a finite amount of time to craft it?
53:26
Like that's I don't think there is a thing that exists in that space.
And these sort of steps where you're like adding minimum efforts to maximizing the amount of contents is like a really interesting idea.
And like, what are those hooks?
We see them a lot in the best games.
53:42
What's the best combinations?
And it's, I love to see it with a game like Vampire Survivors.
And I love that it's like the Genesis, many other games.
We talk a little bit.
About the.
Soundtrack.
We need to talk about soundtrack.
Oh yeah, go for it.
Soundtrack This game has a deceptively banging soundtrack for a $5 game that you would just expect to be like bottom of the barrel shovel Ware it rips.
54:04
It is good.
And I was reminded of it today because I've, you know, played the game quite a bit.
And often times it's, it's a good game to pair with, you know, a podcast or, you know, if you're listening to some, some other music or heck, if you're even like watching some TV, you can probably play this at the same time.
54:21
And so I'd kind of forgotten.
Oh, yeah, this, this music is happening.
Do we know who made the music?
It is it's arranged, I believe, by a bunch of different artists.
And I think the what happened was the dev like reached out on Fiverr to a bunch of people to like have them.
54:37
I'm gonna get this wrong, but this is just my current understanding.
Like basically reached out to like people and was like, hey, can you like make a video game track for me And like just pick the ones that he thought were were like appropriate for the game.
And I gotta say did like, however, process that was that shaped out like these tracks to put in here just slam dunked it because I remember like playing this game in early access when it first came out.
55:05
And there's like there's like a low kind of like humming like, you know, jazzy or like, you know, a good a good like beat going on in the background.
OK, yeah, I can like, this is good innocuous background music.
And it like it always just kind of put a seed in my head where like, it would just start playing from time to time.
55:23
But like, Oh yeah, I should go check out Vampire Survivors again.
And then we played it for the pod, booted it up.
And the first time like the new music just hit me like a truck of just like bam, like like bright electronic Italian vampire techno that just it, it matches the chaos for for the last, you know, 5 minutes of a run so perfectly.
55:50
And just like scrolling through the soundtrack on YouTube, like, Oh my God, like, how am I gonna pick one track to play to play this episode out?
It's gonna be impossible.
And there's like, there's a live concert version.
There's like, there's a version with kazoos.
Like, what part could you ask for?
56:06
I mean, it's got.
A live concert, There's just somebody in the middle of the pit, like whipping back and forth horizontally.
They got a they got a classical music orchestra to to arrange some of the music for.
Empire Survivors, that's sick.
56:23
And, and honestly, beyond the music, like it's got good sound effects, like I feel like more even than the, the, the music like I'll just be today I was just like at work and just the sound effects from it started just playing just like the, the sound that you get when you start levelling up or getting coins or whatever.
56:43
It's just like burned into your brain because by the time you start like really ripping through the levels, you're, you're getting that that sound like dozens of times a minute.
And it rather than becoming just annoying, they serve to reinforce their sense of progression, which is a fine line.
57:05
You could they could very easily become like just absolutely.
I have to turn off the sound because I'm hearing the sound 100 times in this run.
Now a sound that you will hear 100 times throughout any given run.
The treasure chest opening sequence music.
Yeah.
57:20
All right.
I would like this might be a mistake.
Could we all, like, do our best impersonation of it like right now?
No, that's sorry.
Indeed, and I think the treasure chest opening I think encapsulates it's a it's a great example of how this game nails so many like fundamental basics, like really knocks it out of the park when it comes to the soundtrack.
57:47
The sound effects, the feeling of picking up the little XP thingamajigs, the feeling of picking up a a treasure chest and seeing what loot comes out.
Oh, the feeling of picking up a super treasure chest and getting all of the extra Uber loot.
You know, that you get the feeling of just the effects of like killing the enemies and seeing them kind of like Thanos snap away into the distance.
58:09
And I think all of that is outstanding.
And if they hadn't nailed all of those like fundamental bits, it'd be it'd be not quite as good of a game.
And it really does just an outstanding job.
And I, I can't think of, you know, any, any of those, those fundamental elementary factors that it's that it flubs say for the, the, the main menu graphic, but the actual gameplay outstanding.
58:34
And just like, how did you put it Scott on on discord?
Something about like it's just a, it's uploading dopamine like right into your your brain as you pick up those little crystals, those XP crystal.
The Treasure Raj opening animation is too long though.
Well, you can skip it and you.
Oh, not on mobile as.
58:51
Far as no.
You can.
You can pay to skip it maybe.
They can't really skip it.
There.
Are. 3 levels spacebar right?
There are three levels of the chest you can skip.
Levels one and two, the 5th, the third one with five items you cannot skip.
Which unless you had.
59:07
Figure out a patch or something that I am unaware.
Of which I will say, like I thought was kind of annoying at first, but then the more I realized, like, you know, every time I'm getting like a level one and two chest, I'm just hitting, I'm mashing that B button to skip it.
And then when I realized like, oh, I can't skip it.
59:24
This is going to be a big one.
Like it, it, it does have that like that ceremonial kind of like, Oh my God, what am I going to get this time?
Bam, bam, bam.
You know, here's like the five things that have erupted out of the chest.
And like, yeah, you know, it does take like a solid like 10 seconds to play through that animation.
59:41
But like the Level 3 ones are are pretty rare enough that.
Faster.
Yeah, I mean like, all right.
Well, what I meant was like the the effects and the the.
Presence.
Yes, the effects are good.
I get it after you with any game, at a certain point, it's like you, you've played it for so long, you want to have the option to like move on and get back into the actual.
1:00:03
I, I did not know that.
And what's interesting, well, I think it's kind of interesting, is that the game has this pixelated retro aesthetic.
Which is present in the in the treasure chest openings, but it also has these sort of high resolution particle effects that are not beholden to the same level of pixelization as the rest of the game.
1:00:25
And I feel like in it that it would be possible for that to be an issue for that to clash.
But in this game, I don't know.
It works fine.
I don't know how they did it.
Vampire magic.
Yeah, I think the the art style here with it's like it's very Sega Genesis level, I guess of like yeah, pixel ardiness feels so appropriate because like there's a lot of games that I see like on Steam in particular with like the rogue genre in general that that like look too clean.
1:00:54
You know that like they look like they were just kind of like rolled out of a laboratory or like, or like your standard like mobile game, right?
Where it's like it's very like smoothly, like war crafty kind of graphics to it.
And like, yeah, it's just it has that like mobile game aesthetic to it.
1:01:11
And you would think that a game developed by a guy who used to work in mobile gaming and particularly with like, you know, very like loot box heavy game systems, you would think that like that would seep into this in all the worst possible ways.
1:01:27
But I think the developer is, like, very smartly, like, like in judo, when you take someone's, like, energy and you move it, you know, you're taking their momentum and using it against them.
It's like almost exactly like that.
He's using these jiu jitsu judo moves to, like, throw these bad game, like these predatory game elements out of the way and, like, making room for actual good stuff.
1:01:50
So yeah.
Right, right.
He's he's using those powers for good.
I get what you're saying for sure, for sure, without a doubt.
Oh, but back to my other question, Will who are the best characters?
What characters should we be using?
And obviously, it's the bone dragon.
No, I mean bone dragon, the look of disgust.
1:02:08
I just got home.
There's a question about like whether whether or not you have ADLC cause DLC in general had the higher tier sort of dudes.
But power creep right, Right at the gate.
I mean you have, I mean after you get like the initial unlock Catwoman, you want to stick with her.
1:02:23
I don't remember her name.
And then eventually gun, gun person, gun woman.
I don't actually know the gender.
Bayonetta.
Yep, yeah, yeah.
The ones dual.
Like that's a as soon as you get the revive unlock, that one's really good.
And then you have the Phoenix was my personal favorite 'cause it really relied on high regeneration, lots of revivals.
1:02:45
There's not really a right answer to this because as long as you know which general things are S tier, you can crap, you can turn any character into a game.
Well, it depends on like what you're I mean, like there's there's a lot that say that, like the one that's the the armor that turns into is very based, but that's because of a lot of like builds that like are around that.
1:03:08
It's it's I mean really the tier list.
They unfortunately, they give away the game and now I now I, I have this sense of like, Oh yeah, this these things are good.
And that's not, but that's because I'm just now playing it or I think I'm kind of, I mean, I'm on my way out.
This is, I won't open this game after today probably.
1:03:25
But it's, it's still a thing where it's like, yeah, they're all very much bitten.
They all fit into tears.
And it's all like, yeah, there's some wiggle room around all that stuff, like, but Sigma is the best, the one you unlock when you meet the game, like insane and, and possibly insane and, and by the end of it calling you see you guys at level 200 and that's a oh.
1:03:45
Very.
Yeah.
No, I'm looking at the Reddit right now.
People are talking about getting to level like 19,000.
Yeah, no, I, I had 960 on a run.
And by the end of that my supercomputer is chugging because it is struggling really hard because the particle physics of all the insane shit is just too much and nothing, nothing can survive even entering the corners of my screen.
1:04:07
And it's just like, is this fun?
I'm sitting here for 10 minutes watching it kind of like stutter with this, you know, super computer.
And I'm like, OK, I guess I'm an old tab now and wait for them.
So the, the answer is what's best.
What's best is what's mid.
That's the answer.
1:04:23
Because if you choose the best stuff, you're going to have too easy of a time.
And when we fit that, when we fit that difficulty to skill curve, if the skill is just the decision making of like good things, well, yeah.
Well, you don't want to automatically like go to the top of that.
You want to make sure that you're learning.
Don't visit the wiki.
1:04:39
Do yourself a favor.
Don't listen to anything we've said here today.
Do yourself a favor and like you can have a really fun time.
You can have a.
Really just never listen to this podcast again in.
Other.
Words.
Unfortunately, we spoiled everything.
Are you sure to like continue trying, by the way?
Yeah, yeah, there you go.
1:04:55
Will.
So yeah, instead of doing the wiki you would recommend what using the the the unlock menu.
Perhaps wiki of your main?
Menu that's pretty helpful, right?
Is that, is that what you're telling me on Discord like?
The way you should play the game is to like look at the unlock menu and see like what, what, what, what happened you unlocked and be like, OK, what are two or three things I can get in next run?
1:05:16
And that might be a combination of like, oh, there's a character here.
There's if I do an evolution, I might get a little gold and I might be able to unlock a map if I can survive to certain.
And just like try that.
And if you die, great.
But you had it like dying honestly.
And not getting to the 30 minute mark is like, it's a, that's when the learning happens that that's the fun part for me, obviously collecting a bunch of gems and like feeling like feeling the progression of yourself, like, you know, advancing through something that you used to struggle with because you know what to select now.
1:05:46
That's, that's, that's, you know, that's the sweet spot of like the fun.
And it's very, it's a small window and I try and extend it out, like I said, as much as I can and I do a good job, but there's only so much you can do with the, the fundamental underlying game mechanics and, and dynamics and all that fun.
1:06:03
I, I really like the game as well as well.
Get to you with the scores here.
I mean, to be clear, I think all of us like this game.
Like, Oh yeah.
It's just OK.
Good.
I'm glad to.
Hear that it's.
I felt like maybe there was some skepticism about it.
This is a quality game, especially relative to some of the other games we've played, but.
Well, maybe, maybe, maybe it's time to get into scores.
1:06:21
Yeah, I don't know what time is that the are we aiming for a time?
I don't actually.
Know is that oh man I see the grim 30 is coming coming right by right outside of.
My way, he's a 30 minute.
Mark at the podcast.
Oh Lord, he's coming over to do a very complicated death animation where he just kind of jiggles around on the screen and and then I.
1:06:38
Just sort of melt into a pool.
Exactly, exactly.
Hey, can I start us off?
Yeah, I gotta kick us off.
All right, check it out.
This is coming in as my number six game.
Truthfully, it is.
It scores kind of low in terms of roguiness, at least for me personally.
1:06:56
Like there's not much of A story, There's not much of an unfolding narrative.
There's there's not much randomization that like really excites me, but this game is just so Dang, it's so darn fun.
It's very enjoyable, very engrossing.
1:07:14
I think it's very charming, and it is infinitely easy to recommend to people.
Hey, do you got 3 bucks?
Do you got 3 bucks and 50 hours to waste?
There you go.
Free or free if you get free, Which is the superior platform for this game?
Oh.
Yeah.
1:07:30
And I'll kick it over to, I don't know, call.
It everyone has a phone.
No one has.
Steven so I'll yeah, I'll go next.
So I feel like we we've said a lot of good things about this game and a lot of bad things about this game.
I I I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.
1:07:48
I really enjoy this game.
I don't know if I think it's a good game in a lot of ways.
It's like a it's like eating pop tarts.
It's like watching reality TV or you know, it's super fun.
1:08:04
It doesn't feel like I I don't feel like ultra fulfilled after it, but it is the straight dopamine to your head.
It's pure.
It's unadulterated.
It does not require deep, deep thought to get there.
And if all games were this, I would be unhappy.
1:08:23
But as a as a dessert on top of a good beard scratcher, it's a pretty good dessert.
I just, I, I'm going to, I'm going to go now because I call and basically articulated everything that I would have said very well, 'cause I, I, I feel very much the same way.
1:08:41
It's just like I always have a good time playing this game, but I also, I don't know, I, I, I never really remember what I got out of any particular experience with it aside from, oh, there's a half an hour of my life that's gone now and I had a good time, but.
1:09:00
So.
So what are your your list so far for being on a bazillion episodes of the show?
You're not.
As many as you guys.
Bottom of the.
Top I'm just I'm just seeing Andrew's cat right now and it is it is a very it is a cat with a lot of character.
Speaking of Vampire Survivors, yes, he's very bat like.
1:09:19
Woody, your number four-game is FTL, your number three is Into the breach #2 is Dead Cells, and your number one game of the podcast that you've been on so far is Enter the Gungeon.
Where does Vampire Survivors slot into?
There.
I mean, it's at the bottom of the at the of this list, but like, so again, like I've said this, I think every time I've been on the show, I'm only on the show for games that I really like.
1:09:40
And.
So I really like all those games and I really like this game.
I just feel a little bit bad about really liking this game in a way I don't for those other ones because there's like when I think of like Into the Breach and like enter the Dungeon, there is such a beauty to the way those games are designed and like the way that they look and, and play and just how well it all works.
1:10:04
And like this game, I think at its core is just really good at attracting my brain with shiny colors like and so I still have a good time, but not for quite the same reason.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna clock this game in at a 8.5.
1:10:23
For me, that's a four out of I mean I got 46.
I got 4847 right.
I don't know how many we've done, but it's tied with Warsim rogue tower into the breach just behind luck be a landlord, Bellatro balatro, excuse me and rim reld and so I I love this game.
1:10:41
I thought it was a lot of fun.
I'm glad that I had two experiences of it because 2021 played it.
I interestingly, I rated them at an 8.5.
I just checked again and after doing this one independent ratings, I guess you could say I remembered, but not really and same.
1:10:57
And I feel like, yeah, it's I don't really I'm not concerned with like do I feel good about this rating?
Like did I have fun in the moment is like the key thing.
And if you just hook me into I mean, I'm the one who would get into the experience machine, Nozix experience machine.
1:11:12
For those familiar with that.
I get me into the matrix is kind of a similar idea, like if it feels good, it is good and that's kind of the core of it.
And this game made me feel good collecting those fucking gems, hear the sounds and like it does get old, right.
1:11:27
This game is a 40 hour to 50 hour.
I think I I was surprised that you're 56, but like for that amount of time.
Oh, it's just right.
And so it's not going to be.
It's not a slave Aspire, which has all, you know, content to to last me forever and you know, some of these other games, but it is a it's that sweet, like it's a pop tart.
1:11:51
It tastes real good.
Just focus on that flavor.
And then when you're done, just fucking discard it.
Done.
Yeah, for me, it's it's going to be a nine out of 10.
It's going to tie with Gungeon and Star Providence.
Yeah, I, I like this game a lot.
1:12:06
I, I'm glad that we came back to it because I think I kind of bounced off of it when I first played it in early access.
But yeah, I think it's, it's great.
I think I'll start with my criticisms first.
I think the, the 30 minute run length is maybe a bit too long when you're first starting out, especially if you can't like like pause and then like, well, you can pause it, but like, you know, it's still kind of running.
1:12:29
Like I think it works really great on the Steam Deck 'cause you can just pause it and then suspend it and then come back to it later.
I just did that today on the bus.
I I think the other criticism is that like, yeah, they like the little checklist like thing that you have like you should go do this next is like is good, but could maybe be a little more clear.
1:12:47
And I think that's kind of it in terms of my criticisms.
I think like the the the developer and his team are doing like all the right things in terms of what they've put into the game.
I don't know what else they could put in.
I, I think it's like as fully fleshed of a product as you could possibly get.
1:13:04
It's, it's the $5 killer app for the Steam Deck.
Like if you if you have a Steam Deck or a switch like you are doing yourself a disservice by not having this on there.
Or.
Phone.
Maybe I'll check it out on the phone.
I don't know, it seems it's.
1:13:19
Exactly the same.
You don't need to I.
Don't know, like it seems it's that seems like a dark path to go down.
Anyway, the soundtrack I think is amazing for for this game.
I think it's it bats way above punches way above its weight.
The the item synergy and decision making process is is very subtle and interesting.
1:13:38
And yeah, I think like that last minute of any given run is such wild nonsense that like you don't see that really in many other games ever.
And I think this game really deserves its reputation to like reinvent and repopularize a a genre that yeah, like magic survival was a was a mobile game that did kind of the same thing, but it didn't really set the world on fire the same way this did, which is deserved, I think.
1:14:03
Yeah, it totally deserves its reputation for every for everything else being compared to it similar games.
Time for that we have yeah, I just kind of mentioned Magic Survival, another game that I think kind of helps set the stage for this that no one really ever talks about.
It's called Crimson Land.
1:14:20
It's it's super old.
It looks really bland and boring, but is super fun 'cause you're just running around stomping zerglings effectively.
But yeah, Crimson Land, Magic survival, the the pre Vampire survivors stuff to check out.
There's been a lot of like obviously things have fast followed this and it's really kind of spawned its own its own genre to some degree, But there's really only a handful of games, I guess that quote matter in terms of ones that people are still playing.
1:14:48
We mentioned Bro Tato earlier, see our previous episode, one that came out recently that has kind of gripped people is not a mash up I was really expecting but is super is the second most popular one outside of Vampire survivors.
Deep Rock Galactic survivor if you can imagine it.
1:15:06
We have we have halls of torment, we have death must die, which is like if Hades was vampire survivors.
You have soulstone survivors.
God, where Where was 20?
Minutes to dawn. 20 Minutes to Dawn is a good one.
Yeah, Disfigure is a free to play one we got.
1:15:25
Yeah, there's, I think there's maybe like 300 some Vampire Survivor like games out there, but there's there's a lot of them that fly under the radar that people should check out.
And I'll pick that list off with bone raiser minions, which is like, instead of like all the bullets emanating from your player character, you are summoning minions that do the work for you.
1:15:46
You have Picayune Dreams, which like we thought Vampire Survivors was like over the top visual insanity.
Picayune Dreams is, I don't even know how to describe it.
It is it is completely batshit in all the best ways yeah, we'll mention 20 minutes to dawn is a good one.
1:16:03
We've mentioned this figure.
No one has ever heard of gun locked, but I'm going to mention it here because I think the pixel art is great and it's it's like what if vampires?
What if like a survivor's game, but like a side scrolling shoot em up, but you don't have to like aim at stuff kind of.
1:16:22
And then the last one I'll put on here is kind of like an anti Vampire Survivors where you are not moving but you are like it's still A1 stick shooter in the aspect that you are do only aiming but you're not moving called Heretic's fork.
And.
1:16:37
You are, yeah.
You are effectively like a a demonic, I guess like low level software developer building this game for Satan or something.
I don't know.
The the aesthetic is very, very much up Will's alley.
I think it's fine, but yeah, give give those a check out for something to wet your wet your I thought.
1:17:00
Oh, and then there's an entire subreddit called Vamp survivors likes All one word where you can find other people who are similarly interested in all things one stick shooter inspired.
OK, I think it's time to wind down now.
1:17:18
If you want to send in some correspondence to us here on the pod, feel free to do so at grogpodzone@gmail.com.
You can see all of our nonsense tweets or whatever the Mastodon equivalent is at Grogpod at game dev dot place and our website with rankings, previous shows, show notes, all those things.
1:17:37
Grogpod dot zone Woody any any guest plugs before we.
No, I only, I only come hang out with you guys, not part of too much else.
I, yeah, I, I, I'm occasionally on some other podcast, but mostly you guys, they don't call.
They don't call Mastodon tweets Tusks.
1:17:55
Well, for a while they tried calling them toots, but because, you know, it's it's like an elephant Tooting there anyway.
Yeah.
But yeah, there was one game.
Crucially, I left left off that similar games list.
1:18:11
Andrew.
That's right, what are we looking at for next week?
Well, we can't get enough of this genre and we can't get enough of having on guests.
So next episode we are going to be reviewing Holo Cure with a guest star, Danny Rooh, 17, from Twitch, who will be helping us navigate the wild world of V Tubers and the like.
1:18:40
And hey, Speaking of games that are infinitely, infinitely recommendable in terms of their price point, Holocure is free.
So we're gonna be digging into that and I am confident having a good old time.
The best price point?
Well, to play us out from this episode, I've just I've just checked my my clock Lancet and it's just about 10:30 and for the first time in history, it's gonna start raining Minotaur.
1:19:48
