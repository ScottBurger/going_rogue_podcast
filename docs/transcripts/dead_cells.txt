Hello everyone and happy Grogs giving where each episode we hear on this podcast of Rogue Light Games, we sit down.
We take time to reflect and somberly give thanks as we.
Shoot out of a sewage pipe into a dungeon and reanimate ourselves to talk about video game.
0:52
Then we compare said video game to and we we look at its stats and we we compare it against all the rest of the the games that we've already ranked and we decide if we want to keep it or recycle it for that precious shopkeeper gold.
I am your writhing massive goo host of said podcast Copper and imprisoned with me.
1:11
On this island of malaise are my Co host.
That's right, it's me, Andrew Harshman.
And I am of course the very real and very evil elevator that is rocketing downward which breaks your neck, your non existent neck and you accidentally murkle yourself.
1:28
Very, very fun mechanic there.
And I'm Colin.
A call out to another video game that has been transported into this game to do massive damage and joining us as special guest is.
Hello, this is Woody Saskowski, hidden final guest boss.
1:45
You can only you can only get me as a guest on your pod if you play with Five cell difficulty.
So congratulations guys.
Unlock the true ending of the podcast.
This is when when you go to the fandom page for this site, there's a bunch of like.
Or like the Reddit, there's a bunch of like people post pictures of the final boss and they're like, you better put a spoiler tag on that thing.
2:06
What a deal.
Well, I'm glad that we are are filtering out that spoiler tag and having you.
Yeah, well the yeah, the spoiler is that I am the final boss and they're like, what the hell is this guy?
Why is he the final boss of this game that we've never seen?
Some generic thin, balding white guy.
2:22
There he is.
It was the Mia.
Will has transformed into Woody.
Yeah.
We so, like, I don't know if this is pulling back the crowd dynamics too much, but was he like literally like, I don't want to talk about this game, so I'm not going to be on.
The Will's reaction was he opened up the game, played it for maybe 5 minutes and was like I can't do this.
2:45
I don't know.
Like I think.
I think he has such an allergic reaction to games that aren't turn based that but.
He liked Hades a lot.
Like, I think he hates platformer, OK, I think he just categorically hates platformers.
And also since we knew you were going to have, we were having you as a guest.
3:02
It was like fives a crowd.
He doesn't feel quite so bad skipping out.
No that that is fair.
It it is just surprising because it's like.
I kind of, I I don't know if we said you said it, but we're talking about dead cells.
But oh wait, did we say it?
I don't know.
3:18
We didn't because I have my.
I have my little zinger line here in the Google.
Doc.
Oh wait.
OK, rewind it.
Rewind it with the spoiler tag over what I just said.
Beep that out.
And let's take the talk about beep.
And now you say what you have to say.
OK, excellent.
Yes, we'll be.
We'll edit all this out in.
Post I like the way I come and guest on your podcast and I'm like now you talk, Scott.
3:39
That's why people, TuneIn is to hear me get interrupted all the time.
So gather around.
That is, the host job on all podcasts is to be the person who gets consistently interrupted.
So I I am the Conan O'Brien and you are the the guy on the couch whose name I'm spacing on.
3:56
Who comes?
Only I'm a pod.
The guy.
What?
Andy Oh, Andy Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
Yeah.
Andy Richter, Yes, that's the one.
Max Weinberg, Max Weinberg, 7.
Not not watching at home.
Scott did a very nice little Conan O'Brien dance there, so yes.
4:14
We'll we'll gather round the grogs giving table.
Everyone grab a seat and grab a drumstick and heal that 50% health.
For our surprise title game of today is Dead Cells Shock Ray I.
Always think it's weird like with podcasts of they they always take a little bit to the to the conversation of like who is the guest and what are we actually talking about.
4:37
Even though it says both of those things in the title of the episode, that's your I I feel like there needs to be a function in like your podcast Catcher where you can just like spoiler alert on title.
Of episode.
So you don't know what game they're talking about or who the guest is until it actually.
4:53
Starts.
I mean, I also could just say dead cells with Mr. X and then people are like, oh, I have to find out who Mr. X is and then he comes bursting through their walls and like uppercuts them.
Dead Cells Anyway different game.
This is our This is a 2018 release released August 6th, 2018.
5:14
This is our only 2018 game that we played thus far in our catalog, spanning from 2011 to.
This year we somehow spaced on a game from 2018, but I think we landed on a slam dunk of one.
Dead Cells is one of those games that you can literally find anywhere.
5:31
PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and I literally mean anywhere because it's on iOS and Android if you have the quick enough thumbs to play it.
I think you even get it for free on your phone if you have a Netflix account.
Like, like Netflix, they're making a show based on Dead Cells, and so they're like, oh, let's give a copy of Dead Cells to all our subscribers.
5:56
So wait, how do you play Dead Cells on your phone?
You know guys, I'm just going to say, I think that this is what separates us from the younger generation.
Like every every generation has a thing where they're like.
How do you do this?
And I think it might be playing Dead Cells on your phone.
Specifically, the great cultural divide.
6:14
Yeah.
I think there's something about Haiti's coming to to mobile phones at some point soon also.
And I remember reading similar like old man criticism of like how could you young, young and just play it on your phone.
And then someone was commenting of like well you haven't seen my niece or nephew like like do all of like the pinch zooming action.
6:31
And like PUBG is supposedly like way bigger on mobile than it is on on PC.
But I always said I'd be well, you know, old guy who didn't say.
But I guess I found my issue.
Like it.
No, it can't possibly be as good on the phone as it is on my giant widescreen monitor next to my 20 LB tower PC.
6:52
Got to have that monolith of PC.
Well, with something like Pub G, it's like, well, you know, a big part of the world.
You know, gaming phones are a bigger deal because easier, more accessible, cheaper to like get a hold of a gaming phone than it is to get a hold of PC.
So I understand that with like a shooter.
Oh, that's it's a whole thing.
7:08
And depending on, you know, where you are on the globe.
But like Dead Cells, I mean 80s.
You don't need that much computing power to to run it anyway.
But that's neat.
Good on those folks, Maybe.
Maybe that's the problem.
Will wasn't playing this game on a phone.
That would have, obviously.
I'm sure that's what he would have loved improved.
7:25
His experience?
Yeah.
I mean this game came out in 2018 and I think that the company, I mean you'll probably go on this back story a little bit, but I think that the company that made this motion twin, I think it's called, has essentially ridden this game.
Like and just sort of continually release content for it since it's come out and I think they're on like expansion #5 or six or something.
7:48
And I think that new stuff came out like this year, yeah.
And like new new cool stuff.
Yeah, yeah, Motion Twin based out in Bordeaux, France and we've had a few other French developed games on this on the show.
Neat fact about them, they were founded as like an anarchic Co-op so that like everyone in like their small game dev company was.
8:10
I got the exact same salary, totally flat corporate structure and I did worked out good for them.
Apparently they also spun off.
Like a new company from that called Evil Empire, which is like 50 plus people and that has your kind of standard CEO corporate hellscape hierarchy.
8:29
Oh no, What happened?
They were living, living the dream.
If they'd kept that, you know, anarchist structure, maybe I would have bumped up the ranking a bit.
That's interesting.
It did not know that.
So the original, sorry, the original development team was how many people, approximately?
I think it is somewhere around like 10 or 12.
8:46
People so pretty small, but you know that that's about what you would I think, expect from like indie, indie titled games that have like a decent amount of developer firepower behind it, that aren't like solo dev boutique, like weirdo games that you find in weird corners of itch and.
9:05
It's I feel like this game like I I can't remember.
I think that this game was in early Access for like a super duper long time.
I think I remember actually like.
Mooching it off of Scott's Family Sharing for like 20 hours before I The game actually was officially like out of beta.
9:25
And I'm like, OK, I guess I will actually buy it now.
But this is like, for a game that is, you know, not like an online multiplayer game.
This has had sort of a devoted fan base to it all the way since before it was an officially released, and I think it goes to show just how much care.
9:44
Like the development team puts into this game.
Yeah, first impressions.
I mean, I I played this at PAX 2017 in the indie indie dev like Mega booth.
They had a a booth for it and it was strolling around like, yeah, yeah, let's check out these indie games.
Dead Cells, you say, sat down and surprisingly, like not any lines for it.
10:06
I just, like, sat down to, you know, the person gave me the controller and I was playing like, whoa.
This is, this is interesting cause like 2017 like that was kind of a long time ago and I could tell like right off the bat like this has got something special behind it.
Well, I I think that like the the selling points of this game like sound.
10:26
Good pun there.
Oh.
Sorry, they sound appealing, but they don't actually make the game stand out in any way 'cause like.
The keywords on this are like Rogue, like like dead cells, like.
And like that's kind of what it's built on and it's like 2D platformer.
10:43
And there's a lot, I think probably even in 2017, like everyone was kind of riding both the rogue like and the dead or and the not dead cells, Dark Souls, Dark Souls.
That's what I'm trying to say.
The Dark Souls.
Dead Souls, The Dark Cells.
Yeah, well, even the even the title is just like almost instantly for forgettable.
11:03
Like I played this game so much that it sticks in my head by now.
But like I always had trouble recommending this game to people when I was first getting into it, 'cause they were like, what's that game called?
And I'm like.
It's the you know, it's it's it's the special group from Metal Gear Solid 2 with Fat Man, Vamp and and Fortune.
11:23
You know, Dead Cell.
Praise the Cell.
Yeah, well, it sounds better.
Dead Cell sounds better with like a cool French accent, you know, But it's just Scott, there's a there's a little addendum to that.
Your pack story, if you wouldn't mind telling us.
You know what a what, a what a great first impression the game made.
11:42
When you go to these conventions and you're demoing a game, of course, there's like a little sign that'll tell you, you know, please limit your play to such and such amount of time.
But.
Yeah, I mean in your case.
Sat down and yeah, usually you're given like 5 to 10 minutes, like play the game and then make way for the next person in the 10,000 person long line.
12:00
But I, you know, 10 minutes go past and I look around there's like there's no one there and the, you know, I was just like OK, I'm just going to keep playing.
I must have sat down and played it for like an hour or something and it was just like I think it was just the like the the prisoners quarters level, the very first one that you started in.
12:16
But it was just like.
Everything about it felt so polished and fluid and seamless at the time, even that I was like, Oh my God, like they're just going to let me keep playing this, OK?
And then I eventually, like, got up because like, I should probably check out some other stuff.
But it was like, such like an immediate draw, like instantly that I just, I knew that like when it came out fully, like even on Early Access, I was like, Yep, day one got to go get it.
12:39
Well, that's what I think is interesting about this game is usually like when I think about the stereotypes maybe that make up indie gaming.
I think of things that are built upon like really strong, interesting, like innovative ideas.
But sometimes the actual execution or Polish of that is lacking and I think that this game is like the total opposite.
13:00
Yeah, it's 100% execution.
Yeah, it's like a lot of the mechanics and sort of gameplay aspects of this are slightly derivative.
But like, it just feels so unbelievably good to play this game like.
We've kind of jumped ahead of ourselves a little bit, but coming back to our stats sheet intro before we get off the middle too much.
13:23
This Dead Cells rolls in at the number 9 most popular rug like game on Steam with 138,816 total reviews.
Will was correct in skipping this one, because #8 is Slay the Spire with a whopping 100 more total reviews.
But Woody, you've come across a set of alchemical testing notes in a corner of a dank prison.
13:47
How do they describe this game in one sentence?
2D Dark Souls, there you go.
Only did you 3 words and two of them were a record.
For the I believe.
And I I don't, I guess.
I mean, how accurate do you feel like that that is like I.
14:03
Feel like.
I think.
I think thematically that makes sense, but it almost feels a little on the nose that they released a a Castlevania like full conversion DLC 'cause it feels like Castle like Castle Souls or Dead Sylvania or something like.
14:21
That, yeah, I could see that, so.
Yeah, I mean like and even I was just thinking about this when just playing it.
Before we were recording like the door opening animation feels very Castlevania Symphony.
You actually open doors in this game.
You don't just roll through them every single time.
14:37
I open exactly 1 door, and it's the door to the beginning when you don't have a weapon and you have to open that first door.
And it's always confusing.
I roll into it and I'm like, wait, oh right, I have to.
I can't just punch my way through it.
One of the cruelest things that's in this game is there's a weapon that you're like a power that you have to unlock by going.
14:57
To a special area and then not destroying any doors and like you just have to and like immediately.
Whenever I go there I have to be like wait, stop, press X to open door and just like methodically go through because I'm just so used to like rolling and crashing through every door.
15:13
You'd think it would get boring, but it doesn't.
Yeah, it's I I do want to push back though, against saying it's just 2D Dark Souls because I I think that there I I haven't played that much Dark Souls in general.
But I think there is a pretty fundamental difference between them because if you die in this game, you start over and you start at the beginning of of the run versus Dark Souls.
15:40
It's like, so much of it is well, I'm going to just fight this same boss like 16 times in a row until I figure out how to, like, memorize all of its move sets.
But that is that is true in this as well.
It's just the actual gap between time of when you get.
15:56
But I I think that ends up being a fundamental difference because by the time you get back to it, you're doing a different build, you're well, it's been 40 minutes.
Aesthetically, aesthetically, it's like Dark Souls in the sense that, like there's there's like mutated, well, like monsters and skeletons and all, and like all these weird, like creatures that you're running around and bashing and stuff, You're rolling constantly.
16:22
Very dark soulsy.
Yes, sure.
And and I I think the aesthetic has a sort of fundamental vagueness and mystery to it in the sense that like you are sort of on this like mysterious island and world that doesn't have a very clear connection to like why you're here or what is going on or who like who you were before everything started.
16:45
Yeah, exactly.
And that's that's actually kind of the story of this game is like the the the mood and aesthetics like.
Take a long time to actually develop.
And like when you just play through on sort of 1 difficulty, none of that stuff gets revealed and you have to play through it.
17:03
Like each time you beat it, you unlock a new difficulty level and by the time you get to like the final difficulty and beat Spoiler Boss, which is me you you're sort of.
The true nature of is somewhat revealed, but again similar to like the ending of Elton Ring it's like.
17:21
OK, like that was kind of revealed, but I still don't really know what's going on, right?
That's very intriguing to me as someone who has not beat the game on any difficulty.
Yeah, same.
It's nice to hear that like, oh, there's more to come back and play cause I've been playing some games recently where it's like, yo, you know, I enjoyed the gameplay, I'd like to keep playing it, but there's no motivation for me to do it.
17:43
So like when devs, you know, add extra features, extra extra stuff, extra difficulty, you know, options and whatnot, it's that's.
And this game like, really shows the fact that it's they've been working on content for it for like 5-6 years because the amount of content that they have put into this game is just so crazy.
18:04
Like, you know it, it takes a while to beat the game the first time and to like continually unlock stuff, but as you go through in that very first.
Like sort of lobby area of the game.
There's like one of those view masters that you can put in a coin and it shows you all of these empty canisters.
18:22
And like every single one of those canisters of which there's a couple, 100, all have a unique weapon or power that you unlock.
And then even when you start playing on the higher difficulties and then unlock most of those, there's still like tons of costumes and stuff to unlock.
So they give you enough to justify keeping, playing and like.
18:41
That to me is the heart of this game is like, they start like the development process of this, like just makes sense to me of like this is how I imagined it was.
I don't know.
But like, they started with such like a clean fundamental of like, we're going to make this game feel super good and super satisfying to play.
19:00
And once we have that baseline down of like the jumping and the running and the parrying and the fighting, all that feels great.
We're just going to keep adding stuff on top of that to give you more and more to unlock.
Yeah, I mean I I think that like the and that tracks with my like initial impression of it at the get go too.
19:20
It was like this.
It just feels so smooth and solid to play.
But yeah, like when that core fundamental is like so well polished, you can add more stuff on top of that and it's, you know, just extra good sprinkles and things on top of there.
But even just like.
19:37
If if like the if like the gameplay was mediocre, there's so much other stuff around it that is interesting from a development perspective that is that like we really haven't seen thus far.
Like we haven't really seen the only other like platformer game that we that we rated reasonably well was Risk of Rain and that one like.
19:59
Didn't really have this kind of like exploration Metroidvania bit to it, where like you run around and like you get some permanent upgrades that allow you different traversal techniques.
So like climbing walls or like, oh, there's like a thing here that I can teleport to a different part of the map or I.
20:15
Think the Risk of Rain is a game that has way more mechanics in it.
Like this is kind of what I realized about Dead Cells is for all the content in it, it doesn't really have that many mechanics Like there's not like in Risk of Rain you can like stack a bunch of items to get like a crit or a tax speed build the way you would in like a Diablo or something.
20:37
Like Dead Cells doesn't really have like the RPG elements are very light and like you sort of just get whatever the whatever weapon is handed to you and you're like, I guess I'm using this swift sword and like that's always gonna be the same like per run.
20:52
Like the swift sword is always going to be the same if you get it in a different run.
Whereas something like Risk of Rain, it's like I am very much shooting for like this kind of specific build that I'm working.
Like I I just think that that's a game where you really have to understand a lot more about it.
21:08
Whereas this dead Cells, like most of your success, comes just from like memorizing enemy patterns your character fights.
Yeah, I think actually that that's that's where I would agree on that.
Like so much of this game is rolling around and like understanding how the things work and you can basically beat them the same way you you like slightly adjust how you're playing based off of like, oh, I have this melee weapon versus this other one.
21:33
It's like, OK, that means I'm going to like pop up and jump on them instead of like.
Face tanking them for a bit.
But so I I know that I'm going to end up comparing this game a lot to Hollow Knight because that is like my favorite platformer.
And I think that they do a lot of things similar and a lot of things very different.
21:53
But the thing that I think that they do similar that I really like, which is why I like both of them is they feel super like crisp.
In that in both games when you play them, it feels so responsive when you roll around and like the inputs are really tight and it just when you get in that good flow state of just like running around and like hopping around and dodging and everything and that's like it's such a good feeling and it is hard to build that into a platformer in a lot of ways.
22:28
Like I I think that's where this this when we talked about earlier like this game is execution, it doesn't do anything any one thing particularly novelty, but it's everything that does is it executed super well.
And I think that's something something like Holo Knight is basically.
22:45
Just pure execution.
And then this just adds all of the randomness of like, hello, You can literally play with the weapon from Holo Knight, or you can play with other weapons from other game.
You get like, oh, you want to play Castlevania?
Like, well, here's Alucard's stuff so you can play with that too, which I I found delightful when the first time that the the Holo Knight nail was unlocked.
23:09
I'm like, oh, I like this game and I also like this other game, and now I play both of them at the same time.
And Colin, you're talking about like the the gameplay flow and oh how sweet it is.
Like once you get rolling the game rewards you with meta currency, meta progression, currency for speed playing quickly, but also for getting like a chain of kills without taking damage.
23:35
And the there's a mechanic in which you get like speed boosts and you're seeing you're you're seeing all these awesome animations going on.
There's a.
Special Sprint animation and when you're zipping around bashing enemies and going fast and and feeling like proficient and good at the game, it like just really clicks and is really awesome.
23:56
That's very impressive.
Now when you screw that up by accidentally doing like a a a speed boost jump down right onto some spikes.
Oh yeah, that's.
Pretty brutal, but you know when it's feeling good or oh man, this game.
What do what do you guys think about the cursed chess in this game?
24:14
Like the the there's.
Oh yeah, oh man, I I I don't know.
I've never just really decided how I feel about this.
This is like you you can unlock along your quest.
You'll get to Curse chess which you can unlock and will give you a pretty good item and like a stat upgrade.
24:31
But then you die in one hit until you kill 1010 enemies and I will be having very good runs and I'll be like, I should probably get that cursed chest, there might be something great in it.
And then I start to get all like, you just get nervous.
And you start playing off your game.
24:47
Super slow, yeah.
And then you do the you lose that flow state and you jump down into some spikes and you die for a stupid reason.
You're like I didn't even need that stat upgrade and.
That like.
You jumping more angles in there and you're just like, oh the stupidest way of dying.
One tick of damage is all it takes.
25:04
I know.
So, like, I I know that's kind of on me, 'cause I could just make the choice not to take the cursed chess, but I'm so.
Greedy.
One of the pillars of fun, as as described by our absent host Will, is making those decisions.
25:20
And that is a great game, right?
That's a great example.
Of having to make a tough he, he never opened a a cursed chess no.
No, no, I mean I I feel like Dead Cells has a very like.
Not subversive but like not obvious form of like really hard decision making that you have to do as you're playing.
25:39
Where like I I watched a few like high level speed runs of it and Oh my God like they had.
There's like a a whole science to like.
The probability states of like the dual scroll drop chances, chances and things and I'm just like this is the stuff that Will would like lose his mind over.
25:58
But I mean that becomes true when people get into high levels of any game as people start exploring that stuff.
I think it's more, I think more of the testament is that this game is good enough to justify people exploring those things.
Because like, when you think about games that people have dug so deeply in, like Super Metroid or Mario 64 or something, like people explore all of these things that are so complicated and Smash Brothers Melee, you're like, well, those were never really part of the game designed to begin with.
26:26
It's just the game was so much fun that people are like, I'm going to learn everything about this game, right?
There's like, there's like the Super deep end of the spectrum of tactical decision making, but there's like a really like just under the surface of like run around, whack things, decision making of like okay do I want to go on?
26:44
This path or this path or this path.
So in your typical run of this game you know you'll start, you'll always start in the prisoners quarters.
That's the the area that you always start in.
You'll fight the same like low level monsters and things.
But you're offered a choice like do you want to go into this Biome or that Biome and like depending on your style of play, like what your what weapon you picked up, what kind of scrolls of kind of you know invisible hand guided you in this sort of play style direction you could be like well maybe I don't want to go to.
27:15
Stilt village.
I mean, who does or you know, do I do I want to to risk it to go to this other level for like a higher drop chance if the enemies are in that area are going to have like this kind of style of attacking.
Does that like how does that compare with the items that I've picked up thus far?
27:33
Like, do I expect that I'm going to be able to?
Build and synergize with the stuff that I've collected in this run in such a way that I'll be able to just, like, wipe people as I'm going through this level, or am I going to get totally overwhelmed by going in this Biome?
And then there's like like flying vampire bats that just quickly surround you and eat you in two seconds.
27:53
You're like, well, yeah, that was kind of expected because I didn't have the the way to deal with it.
And I picked up that cursed chest super greedily, and I didn't have a way to fight them off from a distance.
Yeah, the cursed chest choice is definitely like.
Heavily influenced by what weapons do you have Do you have some traps that you can like fling out there and just like slowly pick off exactly 10 enemies and then go back to your own play style or and that that kind of like the the furthest I like there was some I I know I told Scott and Andrew about like some some ways in at at some point I got like twice as far as I'd gotten before and it was like all this perfect synergies and like throwing out.
28:32
Traps and stuff and like your playstyle can be pretty heavily influenced by what you ended up getting and what you like.
Traps and your your skill items can very heavily influence your playstyle, how aggressive you are in it.
28:52
So the thing that is, yeah, I mean to piggyback on that, I want, I want to talk about sort of the RPG stat mechanics of this game, because that's the thing that I maybe have the biggest issue with.
But is also the thing that sort of is the most unique about this game.
29:10
Because like what Colin was saying is the items that you get sort of dictate your play style.
Basically there are three colors of stats.
Red is your sort of melee brutality that has a lot of swords and sort of like life steal or elemental mechanics.
29:27
Blue is tactics, which has traps and lots of bows and more range weapons.
And then green is survival which like has a lot of like Perry and attack and then get an attack bonus back things like that but certain weapons only have certain colors associated with them and like they only scale with those colors.
29:47
So like if you get sort of the the the bleeding sword but you're you only that will only increase in damage if you're building up your red brutality stats.
And the thing that so that always I feel a little weird about because if you decide the way you build up stats the best is because it's you know the best offense is a good offense in this game.
30:08
The best defense is a good offense kill.
Them.
And so it killed them first, and you don't have to worry about defense.
And the way to do that is to just only take the same color whenever you can cause.
Like exponentially scaling and it's like the plus 15%.
Adds on to the previous plus 15%.
30:25
So if you decide.
Not the case.
Whatever scroll you essentially decide to get first is like, all right, I am committed to going this color for the rest of the game, which severely limits your options of build.
And I always kind of wish they'd be like OK, I'd like to build green so I have access to some of these mutations and different abilities.
30:43
But then it means most bows that I can't that I find I don't get to use.
And that's balanced a little bit by having colorless or legendary items which scale with any sort of with scale with whatever your highest color is.
But it's just something that has always been a little bit of a sticking point for me.
31:03
But I think like that is part of this game is I think that this game sacrifices a little bit of build customization and flexibility to be like super fast-paced and clear.
Because like, once you know that you're like, oh, I'm just picking red every time.
It takes you a split second to like get one of those scrolls and just select red.
31:20
You don't have to like think about what stat do I want to build up.
There you you come across a random purple weapon.
You're like, well this is not red, so therefore it's dead to me.
Yes, exactly.
Better dead than red.
Yeah, I think like the there's like a weird push pull for like being able to.
31:40
To go into a run of a rogue style game with like a specific play style in mind versus the game kind of dictating to you.
No, actually this is the play style that you're going to to deal with.
Like how are you going to react to it?
And I think that like Risk of Rain does this in sort of two different ways, where like one is the standard way when you first pick it up is like all the items are random and like you don't really have a choice as to what item that you get.
32:06
Sometimes there's like a a pick 3.
Or pick one out of the three selection.
But there is there is like a special artifact that you can unlock and that it's like Oh well now you can actually pick what you want and like then it becomes very much like a build order game.
And HADES is like a different style of that where it's like OK, well maybe like I'll pick this weapon to start with and that will sort of guide my play style and like the other stuff around it will augment that play style.
32:31
But Dead Cells is also very different in the sense of like, you know, it's more on kind of like the.
Pick three or pick one out of three, because there's so many shopkeepers in this game, right matter you have to make you basically make your decision like within the first, because the harder difficult you play, the more and more important it is to just stick with one color.
32:49
Because you need all that, all the damage you can get.
And so you basically make the decision of the play style that you're going to do before you even start your run.
And like Scott said, there's going to be plenty of shopkeepers that will give you weapons of the color that you.
Yeah, no matter how dank and remote in a cemetery you find yourself, there's always going to be a fun little shopkeeper with their neat little tunes hiding out down there to give you some some wares to buy.
33:16
But I think like it's almost, for me anyway, dictated by what legendary items you get.
Because the last couple runs that I did, I I just beat my I just finally crossed the zero BC win threshold a couple hours before I hit that record button and like I got real close last night again with legendary items.
33:40
Because as you're running through the game you'll eventually come across some like grow glowing yellow orbs that are attached to some enemies nearby.
You kill them and then oh, you can unlock this this item that's like.
You know it has an item, you know name and then like a level and then A-L on it for legendary.
33:56
It's a weird kind of like scaling point system of like oh you know you it may be like a Level 3 cleaver, but it's A-L and it has all these other affixes to it that make it crazy good.
It's it's very, it's very Diablo in terms of like the legendary items all have like a sort of affix that is unique to that legendary weapon.
34:18
And so, like all legendary scissors you get have the same bonus affect.
But it's only on Legend, yeah?
Yeah.
And I felt like the the times previous where I was like OK, I'm I'm going to try to build around some items that I got and I foolishly stuck to to some that were like kind of lowest level, like level four and five for like the final boss.
34:40
I didn't do so hot.
Yeah, I have like an Ice Bow 3-L here.
And I was like, what was I thinking?
Ice bow's a trap against bosses.
It doesn't do anything.
But I had this really excellent synergy with like a root grenade that would like root enemies and at this legendary cleaver skill that would like throw these buzz saws out and do like 75% more damage to rooted enemies.
35:01
So Bam Bam, like synergized like that and it was just.
Melting dudes.
And I beat the the final Hand of the King boss in like 3 seconds and I was like, OK, there you go.
But like finding, I feel like that kind of element of like finding, you're right that like you have to sort of build in one color direction, but I don't think it necessarily like limits you specifically like, oh, I gotta play with this one.
35:28
Item because you can upgrade, you can kind of upgrade the items as you go along a little bit.
But I think as as you unlock permanent abilities like with shopkeeps to say like oh now I can re roll the items in the shop until I get something that kind of fits my build a little better.
35:43
That'll help carry me a little further.
One of the things that this game is a lot like Enter the Gungeon in the sense that it's also a game I've played like 200 hours of.
But I think that they are kind of similar in the way that they both had a lot of content released after I had already played through.
36:02
Sorry, I'm getting an important phone call, it will be picked up OK.
They both had a lot of content that was released after I had played through the early stages of the game and so it's like I didn't really get to.
I only experienced like, I think they've gotten more generous with the legendary and the colourless item since the game was initially released.
36:22
And so I've only seen those though on the higher cell difficulties, which is where I play.
Because it's always been this weird thing of like Dead Cells has gone through so many times of releasing a new expansion that like totally changes the game and adds like a whole extra boss and tons of extra items.
36:38
And I'm like, do I want to like erase my save and start start something new and lose all of that other content?
Because it's always weird when you've unlocked like 80% of the game and then they like kind of move the goal posts and be like, oh, here's new content too that already.
36:54
So it it becomes confusing in terms of like what parts have been added after the.
Fact.
And like, sometimes gotten the you, you did not get the same new player experience that I got exactly, exactly and.
I have.
I have gotten many legendary weapons and I have not yet beaten the final boss, despite putting, you know, 18 hours in, which is like a reasonable amount of time to have played a video game.
37:18
Yeah, you'll you'll do it.
Colin, I got.
I will.
I I I almost together.
I got pretty darn close last night, I think.
Oh, and there there are some accessibility options in here to make the game a little easier if you want I will say.
Scott Scott When it comes to this game, Scott Berger's been really singing us.
37:35
It really roasted us pretty hard.
I was complaining in our our private Discord communications about Stilt Town, which is like this pirate themed, you know, der I der I you know, compared to Blight Town.
37:51
Maybe that's what it's called from Dark Souls.
And I was complaining about all these.
They got these enemies.
They're like these big pirate Blackbeard looking dudes with cans.
And the cannon explodes into a billion different pieces of explosive.
And then there's these heat sinking like I don't know what you'd call them, like these blood sucking like slugs that fly around.
38:09
Anyway, after my big long Jag Scott Berger, who is a very nice fellow, he's a gentleman and a scholar, just responds with more like tilt Town, am I right?
Hey.
Oh, that's pretty good, Scott.
After that I was like, OK, well, I I can't let Stilt Town get me down.
38:25
I need to.
I need to get back on.
It I did have a really bad.
Thanks for pushing me to to.
To play harder.
But my my tilt town moment very recently on this last run that I did was like, all right I'm going to play very carefully.
I'm going to like do the the no hit like 60 like kill 60 enemies to get like the extra extra benefits.
38:43
At the end of the level thing, I'm like, okay.
Yeah, got it.
I've got like, really good flow going here.
I get to stilt town like it's gonna be no problem.
I got all these weapons here.
They're just gonna melt dudes.
Cannonball guy comes right around the corner, just blam right in the face.
I'm just like, I had to pause the game and just go really okay.
39:00
Tilt town it is then, isn't it?
Tilt Town is, I mean the nice thing about this and Rogue likes in general, especially when you're like, I don't know, still at the beginning, which is to say 18 hours in like there's still like a ton of stuff to unlock.
39:16
And like as long to me, as long as I'm playing a Rogue like and I feel like I'm getting better at the game and there is more stuff to unlock.
I don't care how often I die.
Like I am happy to keep sort of doing run after run and I get initially frustrated.
But I mean Full disclosure like I I I beat this game on five cells eventually, which is the hardest difficulty.
39:37
But I turned on those accessibility options because one of the options is like respawn at the the you know the Biome that you died and like it is hard to get to the last Biome on full difficulty and then the boss there is like a three stage son of a bitch.
39:54
And so I'm like I don't want to play through this you know 40 minute run where I am you know not super likely to get back to the final boss and then this instantly die on him.
So I just.
Trained the last boss before you.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, especially because by that point in the game, like I was not unlocking new content, so it just became beating my head against, you know, the same levels over and over.
40:17
And so, like, once I finally, you know, beat him with those accessibility options on, I verily very happy.
To set down this game, I wasn't like, oh, I wish there was more content I could keep playing.
It definitely like reached the threshold where I'm like, that got hard enough.
40:34
I'm happy that I put 200 hours into it and I'm also happy to be done, yeah.
And I think one of the the, the, the things in favor of this game where like the the true selling points is that you could play it through for 200 hours and have fun.
But I was also having fun like 10 minutes in already being like oh this is a good game.
40:54
I didn't buy it some years ago because I looked at it.
I was like, I don't know, the graphic style doesn't look weird, like great, doesn't look like has anything crazy novel.
And I like just set aside like I heard about it for a while, but like 10-15 minutes in I was like, oh, I'm gonna play this game a lot because it just feels good.
41:11
And you continue unlocking things and continuing to feel good for many hours later, like many.
Hours.
I'm going to continue playing this game after we're done with this podcast, which isn't true of all of the games we've.
Reviewed Hey that's that's an excellent mark of quality.
I I've yeah, I think similarly, definitely gonna continue to play it.
41:31
And I had a very similar experience, like I was aware of Dead Cells for a very long time it was.
Is one of those games.
Is there a term for this?
The game that you just keep in your Steam wish list for years and you just ignore the sale every time it.
Really should be a term for it, you're right.
41:47
Maybe it's AI, don't know.
A dead sale.
I don't know.
Anyway, so I yeah, and eventually it got so bad that I just removed it from my wish and and a similar experience.
Like I would glance at it and be like generic.
Surely it's overrated.
Surely you know.
Surely I know better, having not ever actually sat down.
42:06
I tried to play the game, but that and maybe kind of divisive.
What?
What do what does everyone think of we?
We were talking about aesthetics earlier.
What do we think of the character design of our protagonist?
The Dead Cell Mr. Mr. Dead Cell.
42:21
Yeah no, I I I agree with Colin.
I think mediocre is a is a fair thing.
Like I like the way this game looks because it's for all like sort of the darkness that's going on in the story.
Like it's not murky the way like.
The Dark Souls is like, it's very colorful and like kind of cartoony and friendly.
42:40
But like the actual protagonist and characters of this game, I don't find very interesting at all, right?
How would?
We describe it to someone who's never played.
It may be sort of a steam punk ninja, but instead of having a head, there's just sort of floating Moat of flame.
42:56
And not a cool mode of flame like oh say like, you know, Ghost Rider or the Headless Horseman, but like this weird pixelated little thing.
And I was the first, like couple hours.
Not even a couple hours.
I'd say the first several hours, dare I say it, 6-7 hours I spent looking for alternate skins.
43:14
I'm like, surely there's got to be one with the head.
And I was playing as Santa Claus for a long time and I was like, well, this kind of works.
He has like a hat or something.
I don't know, maybe I'm not banging on it too much, but I'm glad to hear that I'm not totally off base and people kind of agree that.
No, I I think that that is the part of this game that I think.
43:30
Is not bad, but I think it's probably the weakest section of this game is this game wants to kind of supply you with like lore and kind of make you care about the story here.
But like, none of those aspects really stand out.
And when I think of like the two rogue likes that I've played the most, which is Dead Cells and Enter the Gungeon.
43:48
Like Enter the Gungeon to me has much more of like a sense of humor and like sort of world and lore and weapons that I find much more funny and charming and appealing.
And it's not like I yeah, whereas Dead Cells, I'm like, yeah, you're in a fantasy world full of, like, zombies and muck.
44:06
There's nothing in it that screams like this is this is funny or goofy or particularly charming, yeah.
And that's why I found it puzzling that they opted for the, like, Final Fantasy 7 cloud character trait of the main character.
Just kind of shrugs at everything.
44:22
Yeah, like, I don't know.
It doesn't quite work in this situation.
Like a lot of the humor of it was just like reference.
Look at the thing that you've heard of.
And I'm not totally sure how Gungen is able to get away with it.
And maybe because it's just a shooting game.
I like shooting games.
44:38
It was fun puns, which are the highest form of humor.
Well, no.
But also like part of me I meant was specifically with like references to other media and other material.
I guess it's because like.
That is one of the like central conceits, like right out of the gates, like enter the Gungeon, You're going to be encountering guns from all over the place, whatever.
44:55
And then, whereas Dead Dead Cells, I almost call it Dead Space, Great Name Against.
All it all blends together.
Yeah, Dead Cells is like it does.
It feels out of place every time I encounter a reference to another indie game, of which there are so many.
Why?
Why is there the Hotline Miami baseball bat, and why is it the best weapon in the game?
45:13
There's a whole like room devoted to the.
Yeah, the hotline.
Like, I enjoy playing with the weapons and I it's like, it's fun that they're there, but it it it definitely rides real close to that line of like, OK, fine, references, fine.
45:29
Like I it's not it's not making it better or worse, it's just adding variety.
And luckily for them, it's a really good game to play.
It feels good to play, so having more variety makes it also still feel good to play with that variety.
45:45
But like, if this game was slightly worse, I think it would go downhill very quickly.
It'd just be like, oh, it's both generic and has no sense of soul.
In some ways.
Like, it feels like it's just trying to borrow the soul of a lot of other games where it's aesthetics and sense of humor and stuff, which is not it's strong point.
46:09
But it's also fun that like, like they could have just taken the the weapon from Hollow Knight or the weapon from Hybrid Light Drifter and like made it the same like mechanics.
And they're like, oh, this is obviously a holo night rip off.
But it's like instead they're like, Oh no, it's just obviously a holo night rip off.
46:25
Like we're not going to, we're not going to like, pretend that it's not.
You're like, OK, well in some ways I respect that.
Like, yeah, this is just literally the Holo night weapon.
We're not going to pretend it's not.
And I don't have too much of an issue with that.
I guess, like the whole, like, fanfare of, like, in order to get the Hotline Miami bat, it's like you have to go into a Hotline Miami room that is like, they're dazzled with all this.
46:48
It's like, I don't know, I feel like once you, you know, once, once you had to, like put the whole art department on adding a reference to a game, it's like that's a little, that's maybe a little too much, like spend a lunch break on it and call it a day.
All this stuff that you guys are talking about in terms of like references to other games and stuff, this all came.
47:06
And like I think much later like this was not part of the initial like development of this game like and and also to be clear like there are a lot of references other games, there might be like 15 weapons that you get from other games, but there's like 200 weapons that are like unique to this game.
47:24
So it's not, it's not a huge portion.
Those are just the ones that sort.
Of all stand out the.
I think though they do front load them, which is something you probably did not experience, like they front load the the other game references as far as I can tell.
47:39
That's probably, yeah.
I mean, not that this is an excuse, but that's probably because they were kind of shoehorned in the game after the fact to be like, OK, we can add this weapon.
And so, like, let's put it somewhere early, because we want people who've played the game for a long time to actually encounter to see it.
Can you imagine someone who's never played Hotline Miami?
47:58
Like playing?
This is my first ever video game.
I'm going to pick up Dead Cells.
What the heck is this like?
Weird TV room in here doing and I'm picking up a phone and I mean there are definitely a couple of them that I'm like, I don't know if this is a reference to something or not.
48:13
Yeah, like, I'm sure it is, but I.
Don't know, there's just a lot of like like lore rooms LORE, which I eventually turned off in the options menu, 'cause you just go in it.
You can turn it off.
Yeah, you can turn it off because there's often nothing very useful in them.
48:29
And like, they're like, oh, there's a bunch of old Diaries from The Alchemist who used to live here.
And you're like, great, That helps me not at all.
And then when you actually sort of get to that final reveal of like, here is the ultimate villain, it was not, it was not particularly exciting.
Yeah, I thought it was pretty wild how they revealed that the protagonist actually cut his own head off.
48:50
Yeah, as part of the devious plot.
I hope that's not actually like.
Real.
That's made-up.
It's it's not far off, I'll say.
Oh.
So, so, Woody, I guess like, I only just like beat quote UN quote, beat the game the first time like a few hours ago and one of the, like principal draws of Dead Cells is like, all right, you've zero boss cells.
49:14
You've beaten the tutorial.
Congratulations.
Why Are you ready for the real game?
It's the same as Hades.
I mean, it's the same aesthetic.
I mean, when you would you consider that?
When you go and escape the underworld and beat. 80s for the first time like the game is beaten.
Like I I certainly wouldn't because, like, there's a huge amount of second-half in the game.
49:31
Yeah, exactly.
But in in Hades, there's like, there's a a drive to explore that narrative more like once you've once you've done that with Dead Cells.
I mean obviously narrative light, that's not what we're coming here for really specifically.
49:47
But like, we're coming here for like, oh OK, I've beaten the game, now I'm on one boss cell like.
I was, I was kind of expecting like yeah it's just going to be the same but maybe a little more difficult.
But because I think Rise of the Giant DLC is free now like you.
So you go through like the end credit sequence.
50:03
You get some like nice more drop stuff like OK, like this.
Maybe I'm could be convinced to to try another run here that was pretty satisfying, but you you can unlock like.
Colin and Andrew, you've probably seen some of these doors throughout your plays that have like little like circles, like 1-2, three or four circles on them that you're like, I wonder what's behind that door and those are things that you open up on higher boss cell difficulties, right, Woody and they.
50:32
Are I mean, no.
I'm going to head off your question here to say there's nothing that exciting behind them.
I will say like.
When you play it on one cell difficulty or 00 cell difficulty, you've essentially seen the whole game.
Like the the game is not going to like have some big reveal at like 3.
50:52
You know, when you open a three cell door that's like, whoa, this is a whole new sort of biomer level that I've never seen or this whole other mechanic.
But the game just like scales super, super well.
Like, it's weird.
And this is the case with Gungeon, or like many other rogue likes, is like.
51:08
You'll be bashing your head against like you know the base level difficulty for 20 hours and then you sort of keep putting cells into like that meta progression to unlock like have most of your weapon drops be higher level and then you go back.
And like when I play at 0 cell difficulty in this game, it's essentially a joke.
51:26
And because like not because like I'm particularly great at this game, but just because like the I've unlocked so many weapons and like.
They all drop a pretty high quality and like, I just have a good feel for like how things synergize at this point.
And so like, it feels like I'm barely taking any damage, like even when enemies hit me.
51:45
Because at higher cell difficulties, mostly dudes just kill you way faster and it becomes way more important to just avoid damage.
And so, like, I think that this game really just does a great job of always feeling like.
It's at the right level of difficulty, except like I said when I got to the final boss on five, five cells.
52:04
Like, no more of this.
But most of the time it stays at a pretty satisfying level of difficulty.
And you can, I think you can play this game and get to two or three cells and just happily be like, all right, I've seen enough of it.
It's starting to get frustrating and there's a ton of different final bosses as part of all the DLC.
52:23
There's a there's a Queen final boss who has like.
These minions who trace you up this tree house and those guys, that is.
That is quite the boss fight and quite the experience that is.
That is worth trying.
But yeah, I think that there are plenty of ways to play this game, and for a game that costs less than $20, probably with all the DLC at this point or like somewhere around close to it, you're going to get your money's worth, even if you, like, only beat it on like the default.
52:49
Right, but 10 dollars for everything on sale right now?
Oh, OK.
Nice.
I could have fired up on my phone maybe, maybe not on my way back.
I'm out and about.
So, yeah.
And and I mean and and to reiterate, you know, once, what do you, you know, once you've gotten to, you know, two cells, three cells, whatever.
53:08
And it's like, well, I've kind of seen everything.
It's like you're at 60 hours plus.
Yeah, exactly.
Your money's worth.
Absolutely.
Like that's that's.
Indeed.
Good stuff.
So this game takes a lot of notes from, you know, Metroid, Castlevania.
53:24
And it is right, people, people call it a Metroidvania, right?
Is that is that a thing?
Yeah.
It's a it's a little more that way at the start of it because there are a couple aspects of like runes that you can get that allow you to like do the ground stomp or do like a wall to wall wall climb.
53:43
Indeed, which the progression items.
Yeah, exactly.
Which allow you to sort of progress to different biomes that you never seen it, which I think is a good way to actually lead you into the game because the first time you play this game, there's kind of only one path that you can go on because you can't get to the some of the other exit.
54:01
And so it does a good job sort of giving you the easier levels before it starts barraging you with a bunch of option.
But once you get those like initial five or six runes.
Like that no longer becomes the facet of the game, and then it's not really a Metroidvania anymore at that point, 'cause there's no backtracking like.
54:21
Indeed, indeed.
I guess I I did want to.
I don't discuss that aspect of it a little bit that I appreciated the way that it handles those upgrades, which I I'm not sure if there's a an official Metroidvania term for this, but it's like, you know, oh, you know, you can't get through this part of the map because you can't reach a particular jump, but then you unlock the ability to double jump, for example, and then you're exploring.
54:43
More of that, it's been my experience that in in, well, Castlevania games specifically, like finding those upgrades.
It wasn't like exciting, like it isn't Dead Cells.
It was kind of a pain in the butt.
It's like, Oh no, I have an now I have like, you know, the the werewolf's Pogo stick.
55:00
So now I need to try to remember like where in the map did I see that random spot that I didn't understand earlier And then I'd like to waste.
A bunch of time and inevitably go into a wicked blah blah blah blah.
That's less of an issue with like.
I don't know.
Yeah, simply.
But anyway, so the way it's handled in this game, it's like it felt a little more, yeah, it felt good to get those upgrades.
55:20
And then also it just sort of, at no point when I was playing the game did I feel like, oh, I am, I'm going to hit any dead end.
There's no like dead.
Ends or stop signs, it feels.
Like it's more way to to like Gatekeep some of like the weirder levels.
Where like oh, in order to get to this level, where you have to stay by the lanterns you know you have to make.
55:40
Awesome mechanic.
Oh I love that.
Well explained, definitely.
Let's, let's hold hold off there.
I have a couple of strong criticisms that I'm waiting to start levying against this game.
It's not so.
Anyway, this game is.
Super.
Great.
Because no go ahead I I don't, I don't necessarily want to get into it right now.
55:58
I think that the the lack of backtracking in this game is excellent.
The way that they do the portals to teleport.
Very good.
So good.
Like running through levels that you've already, or like platforms that you've already beaten all the bad guys in.
56:15
Not particularly interesting being able to just like run through something and teleport back, like alleviate.
So much of that, like, should I go, which should I go left or right?
Like, Well, I have to try and choose the one that I know dead ends first, so that when I backtrack, then I go down the main item.
56:33
It's like, 'cause I I have that analysis paralysis in all video games where I'm like, I need to see everything in this level.
And this is like, well, you can go down one and it's the wrong choice.
You just teleport to the other one, see it, and then go back.
And what I eventually did too, with the accessibility options, one of those is like, start with the map reveal.
56:51
Because like basically, and it just shows you the whole mat because basically what you want to do.
There's no like this game incentivizes you to go fast by like unlocking a special door that gives you a good weapon.
But like, there's nothing like Risk of Rain where I like the longer you go, the harder the game gets or something.
57:08
So basically your one goal is like every Biome, you want to make sure you get every scroll that's there.
And so eventually I just got sick of like perusing for every scroll and it's like by having the map unlocked at the start I can just go right there.
Yeah, I think it's probably pretty because I mean the while though it is done very well, the procedural generation layout of the maps, navigating the maps is is is interesting, but it's not.
57:32
A huge.
It's not like a starring feature.
I guess Navigating is not exciting.
It's the fighting the things while you're navigating that's exciting.
And once you put in like an egregious amount of time in this game and you've walked through, you know?
The forgotten sepulture, like a whole bunch of times you just kind of get.
57:49
So you're ready to forget it?
I just, Yeah.
Exactly.
And you just are ready to move on to the next part.
That, like comment said, is the exciting part of fight academies.
Well, good on the devs for including such.
Reasonable.
Yeah, I mean like this game just has an absurd amount of content that has been added after the fact, like.
58:08
There's a custom mode that allows you to just do a whole bunch of like, weird cheating things.
We can like, have every weapon that drops be legendary as like a fun way to explore the different mechanics.
There's a thing that like, gives you no.
You can just enable like having no cooldowns on any of your grenades, and you're like, oh, this just breaks the.
58:25
Game, but it's just sort of built in as an option to sort of mess around with.
Yeah, I think that this game does a really good job of appreciating that.
Everyone has a different tolerance for frustration and everyone you know wants to play the game the way that they want to play the game and like this game does a very good job enabling that right, Rather than like downloading weird mods to do it, you just can click a button and thing be like you're not going to get the achievements for it, but we don't care.
58:56
Go for it.
Go nuts, you've.
Already given us your money.
We don't care how you play our game.
Yeah, well, is it time to start levying criticism?
Because I have one.
I feel like that should be like a you guys named like a little sound Stinger for Collins, like time to levy some criticisms and.
59:12
You're like.
Criticism Levy You've only been saying good things, so I do want to like this is probably something that you, Woody, can no longer empathize with because you've played 200 hours.
But sure, this game is very bad at explaining how it works.
59:32
It does not tell you how its mechanics function.
I learned like 15 minutes before we started this podcast how parry and Shields work, which is 1/3 of the the items you have to tap to parry.
59:48
If you tap and hold, it doesn't parry very well.
It like.
It just blocks.
It just blocks and you don't parry.
And so I was just like, I don't know how to parry.
I'm just going to ignore 1/3 of the items in this game because they don't feel fun and it's because they never explain to you how that system works.
1:00:08
I only found out because I was like, I wonder what that weird number is next to the Shields.
Is that like, why does it have a thing that lets you that's like the the crit thing be like, oh, by the way, also Shields do damage.
Like what?
They never explain that and they're like.
Yesterday, or the day before the forgotten Sepulchre, that level with the lights and stuff in it, I was just like standing there.
1:00:32
I was like, oh, and I just randomly died.
Yeah, my health is going down at an alarming rate.
Yeah.
Why did I die?
I had, I was like, searching the Internet.
I'm like, is there like some sort of weird, like, if my trap was shooting at some enemy, is there some enemy that, like, interacts with traps to hurt you?
1:00:49
And it's like, Oh no, I needed Scott and Andrew to tell me like that the light, if you're outside of the light for a while, it starts doing, damn, she was like, it does not, it does not tell you that.
Is true.
And that that feels especially bad in like a rogue like game where you're like, oh, I made it to this level.
1:01:06
I've never been to how exciting I'm farther than I've ever been.
And then you die for random crap and you like, I don't know what that was, 'cause this was a new level with a new mechanic.
Yeah.
So I I feel, I feel like there's a lot a lot of this game.
It doesn't do a good job of explaining how it works.
1:01:24
And then if you're like, OK, I need to go look at the Wikipedia or the the wiki to to do it.
It's like there's an overwhelming amount of content on it.
So you get bogged down looking at like every single weapon, things like is there something weird with these weapons blah blah blah and you're like oh, I forgot to ever look up.
1:01:41
Just like how does.
Basic mechanics, Yeah.
Like or even the thing like how much damage does a crit do?
I thought that it it.
So when it shows you the weapon value, it says like 111 in white text and in next to it, it has a little yellow text with in parentheses and then it says DPSI thought that the yellow text was the DPS.
1:02:03
It's not all of its DPS.
The yellow value is the crit DPS.
Like.
It doesn't explain that.
Andrew's finding out this right now.
Like it it it doesn't explain and like you basically have to go to the wiki to learn how like core mechanics of the game works.
1:02:19
Which is very after we've done this podcast.
Very.
That's very dark cells of it.
Yeah, yeah, I don't.
Like, sorry, I don't like that.
No, me neither.
And especially as we've gotten further into this podcast, I've become less forgiving of that kind of stuff.
1:02:34
Like it your game.
You should not have to use the Internet to to understand how the game you're playing works.
It should it?
It might.
Maybe you have to go like read the encyclopedia, but you should be able to figure out how everything in the game works within the game.
1:02:51
You know what this game is missing?
I started up a fresh file speed or save just to like make sure like, Oh well, like what if someone's listening to this podcast?
I've never played Dead Cells before.
What's their first player experience like?
You first start the game and you have like.
This helpful little night person who's like welcome to dead cells this way please.
1:03:10
And like you have these very standard kind of sword and board weapons to start off with.
I feel like that should have done that tutorializing maybe a little better.
There is like a thing.
I think.
I don't know if you have to unlock this, but there is like a little training ground that you can play in to be like all right, like set the enemy types and just run around and bash them And like I don't know if you take damage or anything, but it's very much like a sandbox but like.
1:03:34
It's worth calling out when games do tutorialization well, especially in this type of genre.
And I don't think there's really any tutorial for this game other than you start, you're a goo that unceremoniously just plops on the ground and absorbs into someones decapitated body and then.
1:03:52
Have fun.
You're on your own.
Like, set off into this world to to explore it.
Kind of a deal.
So there is and like for your first run you don't need it, but like the fact that there's not a thing that you can go back and be like, OK, now I want this, a real tutorial.
Yeah, the thing that that, like I spent 25 hours without realizing this and this.
1:04:09
Like Dead Cell, Dead Dead Heads will be listening and be like, what do these people even play this game?
Like I played 25 hours with trying to like get the scrolls to balance out the power numbers.
Instead of focusing all on one.
Oh, well, no.
Again, you would think that's, you know, yeah, the different stat scrolls that you're talking about, that's would be a very common mistake is because basically the scrolls color that you have the least of gives you the most health bonus.
1:04:34
Yeah.
And so you kind of assume like, oh, if I want to build like with the most health, I should get the biggest variety of scroll colors.
And it used to.
I kind of feel like it used to be more that way.
They've kind of.
Fine tune the way the stat mechanics work in this for a long time and now it is very much just like get all the same color.
1:04:53
But yeah, just like you said, like the game doesn't tell you that.
You basically have to go on Reddit and then post a screenshot and everyone will tell you what the hell are you doing get all the same colors.
The other thing I'm I don't know like I'm still also kind of like wishy washy on like the the item tie ring system where it's like oh I got like buzz saw, buzz saw.
1:05:11
I I I I.
Plus.
Plus.
Is that better than Ivs or?
Frankly, I've played 200 hours of this game.
I don't even, I don't even really understand that.
I wish that that was not so confusing.
I wish they just kept.
It's actually very, very simple.
If you go read the wiki, of course each plus is the equivalent of two extra levels, so.
1:05:33
Why don't we just add more levels to it?
Then why don't we just make the number higher?
Like yeah, I don't know so but but like literally it's.
So if you have like a three plus, that's the equivalent of A5.
Like it literally in the back end of the game just adds 2 more to it.
So like an L, the legendary version is +8, so a 3L is equivalent to like an 11.
1:05:55
Also, why do they go plus plus L instead of just like Bali?
Don't know or BAS like I don't know.
Now you know.
For all, for all those dead heads, for you know, for anyone who's like a friend of a friend of one of the devs.
1:06:11
Like, you know, let's be clear.
Like, the fact that we're having such nitpicky, pedantic complaints is a great sign for how fantastic the core gameplay is.
Like, you know, we've got lot to talk about that aside from like the the the naming conventions.
1:06:27
But yeah, I didn't even get into the.
My news with that it is kind of silly though I will admit, and I I tend to agree that like, the communication of stuff is not is not great.
The shield stuff, like, yeah, I'll I'll just try to do more parrying like I I thought it was.
1:06:43
I thought I didn't realize that there was a difference between tapping and thing.
Yeah, I've done all the timing.
I've done 15 minutes of it and I was like, oh, it feels great now.
Yeah, I I I in all my many, many years of playing video games like.
The idea of holding up a shield has always been so, so foreign to me.
1:07:02
Like I the only time I think I've ever, like, consciously used a shield in a game is we had to bounce back.
The Deku nuts in Ocarina of Time like to actually proceed in the game, and other than that I'm just like a shield might as well not exist.
And so like when it does, it's Mario Kart style.
1:07:21
You have to hit it at exactly the right moment, but then you hold it.
The fact that it's you have to do it at the right time and then let go it possibly foreign.
I would never in a million years have I just.
Interested in that?
That's odd, because I just remember that that clicking with me and I'm like, oh, actually this is the first time like a shield has been satisfying to use.
1:07:40
And maybe that's because, like, I knew even though I hadn't played a bunch of Dark Souls going into this, Like, I knew that comparison.
And like parrying in Dark Souls is a big part of that game.
Yeah.
It's a separate button though.
Sure.
Yeah, I was coming at it from that perspective as well.
But anyway, well, any who probably I've never played Dark Souls.
1:08:00
Yeah, that's fine.
I've only played Elden Rings.
Shelden Souls.
OK, Elden Ring.
Elden Rings.
I've played all of the Elden Ring games.
Yeah, exactly.
Do we want to transition to rankings?
Tie up, tie up?
Our last game of this season of games that we played?
1:08:19
Maybe I'll Andrew will put you on the spot. 1st for let's do it.
Rock'n'roll.
Sounds good.
Yeah, sounds.
I'm glad that I'm finally playing it.
It is very enjoyable.
I like it a lot.
I don't know if we've discussed at mentioned very briefly the animations, animation work is really great.
1:08:42
I love, I love seeing a 3D rendered door open up.
I I do like destroying them as well.
But seeing that swing open that that low Poly door that's set on a 2D background is just I love to.
1:08:59
I love, yeah, I love to see it.
I love to see it in particular.
And there's a lot of animations that are just like just so silky smooth that they.
They trick your brain for a minute like oh maybe this is a 3D thing like for example the the the starting Archer enemy as they bring up the bow is is very sleek and smooth and also always love a game that has a custom low health animation.
1:09:23
I think the first time I saw it was like Max Payne one if you're low enough health oh he holds his stomach.
Mr. Ninja, Mr. Dead Sillman does the same thing and it's great.
So anyway, I'm plopping this down at.
Number six in my ranking list, it maybe it should be higher in terms of like my personal preferences, probably higher.
1:09:45
But I don't want it to take over Rimworld.
It's right.
It's right there.
It's neck and neck.
But just out of respect for our missing post, our missing crew member I I got to keep Rimworld at #5 and this game Dead Cells at the game would.
1:10:04
Recommend.
Dead Cells, Yeah, I think this'll, this'll top out at #2 on the charts for for the Scott rankings, just behind my #1.
Still cog minded, just ahead of #3.
Risk of rain.
I like all and like these rankings at the top are like kind of meaningless because they're all like so close together.
1:10:24
But like there was a moment when I was playing on on the steam deck in airplane mode.
On and I had like this really solid run going.
I'm like, OK, great.
Like I'm going to quit here and then like I'll pick it back up on the desktop, like, you know, turn the Steam deck back on.
And it didn't sync the the save, like the save was just totally lost to time And I was like, Oh my God, I had such a good run going.
1:10:49
And there there are games and there are times where that would just be like my end of that game.
I'd just be like, you know what?
I've experienced enough of the game.
I think I got it.
That can be like a make or break decision.
That was not a make or break decision here.
I think like that was very much a well, let's start a new run and see what happens.
1:11:06
This game definitely has that.
Just one more run pull that you want from this kind of genre.
Be really good.
I think like the aesthetic.
I think the art design for this game is is amazing.
The main character is OK, but you have like 500 different skin.
You can play as Sonic the Hedgehog as your skin.
1:11:23
So you can be a snowman, you can be Santa Claus.
Like I played a good chunk of this as the Ironclad from Slay.
To Aspire, your options are limitless.
The gameplay is perfectly fluid.
It seems like when you get items that synergize really well, you feel invincible.
1:11:39
And that's like such a good feeling in a in a game where difficulty can be, like, really punishing, it feels like a very good way.
It'll be like, haha, I've got you game and then when like the soundtrack kicks in and you're got like the float and your character's ninja running all around, you're.
It's just everything locks into place and it feels so perfect.
1:11:57
So it's going to be, it's going to be a number 2 for me like just behind Cog Mine, which I think is the best in class of traditional Rogue likes.
I think this is maybe the best in class for like your meta progression action E platformer Colin Gear up next.
I'd say that So this game if if a game doesn't have a good enough story or aesthetics, I feel like I just compress it into do not care about it at all.
1:12:23
Story irrelevant to me.
Could have no story, would make no difference in my ranking of this game.
Aesthetics, they're fine.
Makes no difference in the ranking of this game.
It's still my #3 of games that we've played because it doesn't matter.
1:12:38
The gameplay flow of this game is so good, it just feels good to play it.
And like that is the the core of like running through, getting that sense of speed like I most of the ones I do, I play brutality, which is the like get up in there and melee, don't worry about blocking, don't worry about shooting from afar, just like get in, slash around, moving constantly, doing everything, running as fast as you can.
1:13:04
It just feels so fun and fluid to play.
Like it could be just little abstract cubes on a screen and I would have the same amount of fun because the mechanics, the execution of it is so good.
I'm putting at #3 despite being like the same rank as my #2 game Monster Train, just because of I I literally dropped it right before we started this podcast because of the revelation about Shields, because it's it's so frustrating to me that how how bad the the explanation of the game mechanics are.
1:13:36
Like I I enjoyed the 15 minutes of playing with Shields that I did like.
Do I have like a whole second game to play that I didn't know about before because I didn't understand how 1/3 of the mechanics of the game works?
Maybe, probably not.
But like I'm excited to at least like test it out.
1:13:53
And it frustrates me that I got, you know, I've put 18 hours into this game in the last seven days, like that's 1/2 time job and I didn't know about like a core mechanic and I don't really feel like it was my fault.
So like there's still there.
There's I had a 9.5 out of 10.
1:14:10
There are a couple of, like, little little chinks in the armor to keep it from being a 10 out of 10, but still one of the best games I've played in the last couple of years.
Woody, bring us home.
Tell us how.
Your games on your list so far are #1 is Enter the Gungeon and #2 is FTL faster than Light.
1:14:29
Where does dead cells fit in here?
I mean, I have the, like, nice benefit of only being on the pod, like to talk about games that I like because you asked me what games I wanted to be on for.
So, like, my list is kind of slanted.
I don't just like every game.
I just happen to like every game that I volunteer to be on the podcast for.
1:14:46
I'm going to put this at #2.
I like my man.
Gungeon ranked supreme.
Gungeon ranked supreme.
Like I said, I like the aesthetic like.
Gungeon and Dead Cells are both just joys to play, and like the difficulty level feels right the whole way through.
Gungeon, like the aesthetics and the humor is just more memorable to me.
1:15:06
And there's like, there's weapons in Gungeon that when they drop, I'm like very excited to try them and see how they work.
Like in this game, when I see a weapon I hadn't seen, I'm like, oh cool, I'll try that, but I'm not.
Like I'm not.
Awash with joy the way I am with some of the weapons in Gungeon, but I do think this game is a total delight to play.
1:15:27
Super addictive, super fun.
Like I said, very happy with the many, many hours that I put into it.
And yeah, I think that I I played, I played the life out of this game and mushed it, mushed it back into the mush from where it where it can return.
1:15:44
So yeah, great game.
Definitely, definitely worth a try and even.
Yeah, I think that the endorsement here that I think means the most is Collins because like he he was not big on on Gungeon because like it is kind of unforgiving at first, but like.
1:16:03
You know, I think call Colin to correct me wrong, but like you found your way right into dead cells from the beginning.
And like, even though I'm sure you were dying a lot, like, Oh yeah, it's.
Inviting right from the start.
And so I feel like that speaks really high, that you can play it for a few hours and have a great time or you can put in tons of hours.
1:16:20
I will have to bring in our absent Co host Will's criticism, which is platformers are bad.
Mad 'cause bad.
Sure.
Super.
Mario Brothers, Who needs it?
So it's I will say this game is not for everyone.
1:16:36
If you don't like platformers just as a concept entirely, it is still very much a.
Platformer, actually, that much platforming even in this game, because it's not like platforming is a lot of like jumping from thing to thing to not die.
Like most of the levels in this game don't have pits that you can fall into.
1:16:56
There are some spikes but like.
Mostly the way that your character moves around, like you're not doing a bunch of slow paced precision jumping.
You are still doing a lot of jumping and moving though sure.
So if.
But that's not your jam.
If 2D side scrolling, jumping and fighting isn't your jam, this is that game in spades.
1:17:16
I like that for the most part.
It's not like.
So for dungeon, I don't really like Bullet Hills and this is not a bullet hell.
So, like, there you go.
But like, it could be the best bullet.
Hell, it could be Engineered Gungeon and maybe it wouldn't like it.
If you don't like platformers, if you don't like side scrolly stuff, this is that.
1:17:34
It's the best of that.
But if that's not your thing, then don't play it.
There are a lot of other great games out there.
Yeah, like Dead Cells.
So for our Similar Games segment, I was kind of like scratching my head a little bit because Dead Cells feels like such like its own unique thing of like this very fast-paced combat.
1:17:53
Mild platforming elements, not quite Super Mario World level but but like other games that stunt that kind of stuck out is like oh these are kind of in the same vein of the dead cells realm would be Rogue Legacy One and two I think have a very similar kind of design aesthetic.
1:18:12
Skull the hero Slayer in terms of like meta progression unlock stuff.
Spirit fall which is like a platformy side scrolling almost like smash like.
If if you combine Dead Cells and Smash Smash Brothers recently, I think Smash Cells.
1:18:31
Yep, yeah.
In Early Access right now, a game called Oblivion Override which has a very interesting demo.
Very much more.
Yeah, it's.
Oh really?
Dead cells, but robots, I think.
Woody, you and Andrew, I think, have played Super House of Dead Ninjas.
1:18:49
Before.
That game's fine.
It's not.
It's not much anything to my to my memory it's.
Literally not much of anything to me because I I don't think I have played it actually.
I think it's like a throwaway Adult Swim game where like ninjas come at you and you attack them.
It's a very fast-paced platform ish and another game that's come out that has kind of purest fans of the property shaking their heads a little bit.
1:19:13
Blazblue entropy effect.
A very interesting game that like kind of has nothing to do with the Blazblue franchise, but maybe like vaguely themed about it.
Question mark.
But again, another.
It's gotta be Blazblue, right?
Is it?
What is you?
Sound like you sound like a huge, huge door.
1:19:30
Blazblue.
Blazblue.
What?
What is there with all these kids in their eyes spaces and I honestly.
Don't know, 'cause I don't know if I've ever talked to someone about Blazblue.
I just I can't imagine that they would be.
It would be called Blazblue the.
Way it's spelled.
1:19:45
Maybe the typography?
There's no E.
Yeah.
No, I I'm not.
I'm, I'm not saying you're wrong.
I'm just saying when.
You want someone?
Pronounce it you're like.
How did anyone decide to name it that?
Whenever I go to Taco Bell, I always get a blaz Baja blaz.
Yeah, exactly.
1:20:00
Blaz Baja blaz.
OK.
But hey, well, that's it's all good.
Such is life.
Interesting.
But so there's a new Blaze Blue.
Well, and it's and it's like Rogi.
The pushback from the Steam reviews is like.
It's a it's a It's like a Japanese anime fighting fighting game.
1:20:20
Street Fighter, but yeah, it's like, it's like Yilty Gear if if there was a Street Fighter rogue like game that was like set in the Street Fighter universe and didn't have any of the Street Fighter care in it.
But it still said.
Right.
I totally understand based on that explanation exactly what it is.
Yeah, gotcha.
Gotcha, gotcha.
1:20:36
Lots, I think.
I think Rogue Legacy is is far and away the best comparison.
Except I think Dead Cells is way better than Rogue Legacy, just in terms of how it feeds I.
Mean, I think honestly, if you're going to be starting to compare it to games.
You you really have to start comparing it to games that aren't Rogue likes Holo Knight, Shovel Knight, other Knight based games Castlevania like that.
