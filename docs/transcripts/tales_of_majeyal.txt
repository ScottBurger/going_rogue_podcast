The podcast is changed.
I can feel it in the audio, I can feel it in the editing.
I can feel it in the air.
Much of what was traditional Rogue likes is lost for none Now live.
Who remembered them?
Happy Groggantine's day everyone.
0:47
Hooray this, this week, this episode you are joining us on.
A very nice way to spend the time with your significant other by listening to a video game podcast where people talk about Rogue like video games of all tastes and flavors and fillings and whatever whatever kind of message that you get on the candy.
1:11
I am your master of both the podcast and of Dreadful Tower.
Scott Berger and adventuring across this fabled fantasy continent, plotting my doom are my podcast Co host.
Hello, it's Colin and my horde of Pok√©mon.
1:28
I mean monsters that I have summoned my bidding to defeat my enemies.
And this is, this is Will, this is the the the extra life the enemies have.
That's that's that's the essence of what I am here, that you think you've got them beat, but Nope, they were just at half health all along.
1:46
And lastly, it's I Idalon, Andrew Corrections Corner.
I'm sorry, mid nightmare Reaper.
The Sprite update actually came out in 2020.
It didn't come out last.
Year.
Harshman.
Out of the way, all right.
Indeed, indeed.
Well, this episode we're casting all of the charm spells we can muster this week with talking about a biggie.
2:07
It's Tales of Mahjayal probably our our it's our newest oldest game.
I think the oldest game that we've covered up to this point was 2011 possibly FTLI think was maybe the old, the oldest game that we talked about thus far.
2:24
Maybe Binding of Isaac.
I think maybe those were on power with each other.
But Tales of Mahjal Tome came out originally.
Well I guess to be clear we're talking tome 4 this time.
This game has kind of had a long, grandfatherly history, coming out originally as Tales of Middle Earth back in October 24th, 1998 and iterating and iterating along the way until we have what we now recognize as tome Four, what we're playing today.
2:55
Which canonically I'm going to I'm going to use the May 11th 2010 release date for it because it did predate its Steam release by a little bit.
But if you go on Steam you can see it was it was released on Steam a little bit later December 31st 2012, but we're going with the 2010 date.
This is APC ass PC game.
3:13
Let's to be clear, this is a game that you can find for free on the TE four.org website where donations are happily accepted along with some paid DLCS and you can find it on Steam pretty routinely anywhere between like $7.00 not on sale and like I think $2.00 or less than that when it does go on sale very frequently and you can find all the DLCS on there as well.
3:36
This was made.
This is a solo dev with an open source support effort by Nicholas Casolini, a French dev that people might know better on the interwebs by his Internet moniker Dark God.
3:52
And this is a very engaging game for people that it resonates with.
This is a game where you're this is, this is my new interjected stat segment because people love numbers so much.
What's my quote here?
Your average player of this game has about 129 hours in it.
4:12
And our last little bit of numbers trivia here, this clocks in as our number 167th most popular Rogue like that we have with 4773 total Steam reviews.
Colin, your mission escort is about to jump jump head first into a pack of wolves.
4:31
What one sentence description do you give them of tome before they are sent to the idol on plane?
You're in for a treat playing a truly traditional Rogue like game.
It's got all, it ticks all the boxes and it's pretty fun to boot.
4:49
We we have not.
Despite go to your death.
Go to your death, I.
Mean Despite being titled a Rogue like podcast, I think we we spanned the broad spectrum of what's included in that that category.
But for purists, for traditionalists who adhere to the strict dogma of the of the religious texts, we haven't really talked about many traditional rogue likes on this program.
5:17
We've talked everyone's favorite hack slash loot.
We've talked Cataclysm, Dark days ahead sort of the stars of the Pit dungeons of Dreadmore, Shattered Pixel Dungeon and Cogmind.
And I think this this is kind of those, let's see dungeons of Dreadmore, Shattered Pixel dungeon.
5:33
I guess Cataclysm.
I don't know we we kind of dunked on Cataclysm a lot but all those in and Cogminder kind of well, OK, maybe not Dreadmore, but the rest of them are like new wave.
Traditional rogue likes this.
Tales Of Montreal I think was the last hurrah of the original pre Steam era.
5:54
Traditional rogue like games and yeah, has a very long and storied history.
I've got a whole bunch of factoids here ready to go, but I'm I'm curious about people's first impressions of this game because it's been a little while since we've played said traditional rogue.
6:13
Like Andrew, you have not had the opportunity to play a traditional rogue like on this program yet.
You've been spared up until this point.
I'm curious around the horn that I well I go OK, so the first thing that when people are going to be frantically Googling the this game, when they come to it, they'll most likely come to the Steam page and they'll see the art for this game and the trailer that showcases said art for this game.
6:38
Do we want to go around the horn with art impressions to to kick off or do we want to save that for later?
Oh, I'm, I'm OK.
I mean, this is going to be a lot of just talking about the negative aspects of it from my point of view.
So if it wherever you want to start is fine by me.
The art I know, Andrea, did you want to take it?
6:57
I know you felt a lot more strongly about this than I did, but.
I I think we should maybe save the art discussion for maybe mid episode, but I do like the idea of going around the horn very briefly and and you know giving you know a one or two sentence review of an overview of our experience.
7:14
So I had a very busy gaming week.
I was painting up a storm.
I was dice rolling up a storm.
I was able to cram at the last minute and I got just under six hours into of this game, which let's keep in mind that the average AAA shooter is probably less than six hours long.
7:36
Six hours is a pretty, pretty decent chunk of less.
I come off a little, you know, too defensive.
Anyway, I played for about 6 hours.
The furthest I got was like level 7 or something.
I did not finish on none of my runs did I finish past the first quest, and I would say that for those six hours I think I was able to grok the appeal.
8:01
But I can tell you those were a pretty neutral to bad.
Six hours of gaming for me is my is my quick overview.
But the rest of you had a very different experience in terms of the amount of time you played and your levels of enjoyment, varying levels of enjoyment.
8:19
Yeah, for me, I had.
I had put about 20 hours into this game a couple years ago, so I had, I had kind of a a preview as what this game was about.
I at the time I, despite putting 20 hours into it, never really got very far, never really understood what I was doing.
8:36
Never really grokked the the immense depth that there is to this game and was always just kind of like, yeah, I don't know people people really like it, but I'm not sure why.
But this time around because we've been forced to play it for the podcast by my choosing.
8:54
I think I've come around to it quite a lot because since then we have played some other traditional rogue like games.
I've put 100 hours into cog mine since then and then coming back to tome I was like OK yeah, I think I think I get it now and I think like it's kind of opened opened my brain up to to similar games like this that we'll talk about later.
9:16
Where before I was like I don't have any idea how people could find this fun or interesting and now I'm like OK, I think I I can get it.
I don't.
I'm sure that those games that we'll talk about later are not quite for me but this this feels like a last harrumph and hurrah of like your your very like hobbyist level tinkering PC gaming where you're going in and you're like Oh yeah.
9:38
I want to like change up the the mod or like dot ini files and like really go in and start ripping it apart and putting my own like flair on it.
It feels very, very mod Y and tinkery from that perspective and even just like all the crazy amount of stuff that's in it.
9:58
Every time that I come back to this, I'm like, I want to experiment with this thing next, and that's always been a refreshing experience.
Well yeah.
No, I I think I, I, I out of the four of us.
Somehow I I can't believe I looked at my the some.
Hours.
How could it possibly?
Somehow kind of 60 hours, 60 in the span of two weeks.
10:18
I work really hard as you can.
I didn't enjoy it.
That's The funny thing here.
It's like I was just torturing myself because I wanted to fucking beat the game and it was just the day that I finally got that W and I tell you what, yeah, it's not worth it.
10:34
Don't do it, folks.
Scared straight.
Yeah.
No.
Like, OK.
The the the the in a nutshell.
The the problem is that it's a rogue like game.
Traditional roadway.
You if you want to dress it up with other words.
10:49
You can but like.
The nature of this kind of game is is just bad overall and the the core reason I've got a lot of thinking about this, and I think the core reason is that you just, you don't know what the enemy's going to do.
You'll have If you have three or four enemies on the screen and you're on, you're like a dungeon.
11:07
You're in the hallway or wherever you are.
You don't know what the enemy is going to do.
Of course, over time you get more familiarized with that kind of thing.
But, like, ultimately the only way to really know is to, you know, hover over them, inspect the character, look at all their talents, look at and the mouse over every single talent, see what the range of that talent is, see what the cooldown is.
11:28
And only by, you know, taking careful logs of, like, exactly when they use certain talents and how you know the cycle.
Like, can you know, like, when it's good to do certain things.
And so basically, at the end of the day, you just end up memorizing an algorithm of, like, use these talents in this order, change it up if there's a spellcaster or if there's something with high health.
11:48
And just do that over and over and over and over again.
And, you know, all the fun, if there is fun, is in the 1st 25 levels where your build is actually changing rapidly.
You're getting new things, you're unlocking things, you're you're becoming this powerful thing.
And then it's just 25 more levels of OK, here's another kind of somewhat useless talent point, and OK, here's another, like, mildly better piece of equipment.
12:12
OK?
And terrible plots.
Terrible.
Hang on, hang on.
No.
Well.
What about?
UI is terrible.
I mean, there's just so many things about.
This game, the UI golly.
The music, of course I turned off right away, as I do always.
12:29
But the music is actually bad for this, right?
No.
No.
OK, Well, no.
No, no I also.
Turned it off.
Should be noted.
But the Rockin.
The Rockin Arena tunes though, I mean.
Oh, the arena tunes.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to give it a listen right now.
12:47
Well.
You say terrible story.
Oh yes, please.
Call him I'm curious.
You might be in the middle I between these two experiences.
I mean, I I mostly liked playing the game, so therefore I'm in the middle.
Yeah, I know.
13:02
I think there was a lot of, there's a lot.
I I agree with the like the UI being an issue.
I do not care about the graphics at all.
I I think that it they they did fine to get across what what was happening, but I wish that it was a better system to like display information like getting getting like to Will's point like of getting the stuff out like figuring out what the enemy would what abilities they had to do.
13:35
You, you were a little overwhelmed with with what everything did and what everything had.
And like the amount of work it took to get that knowledge into your brain, if you didn't already have it, just memorized.
But like, on the other hand, like, it was kind of interesting.
13:53
Like every single thing that you fought had talents and abilities and stuff that you yourself could also have.
Like I, I, I did kind of like it's definitely a philosophical debate of like should the enemies be doing things that you can do or not is it?
14:16
And like, I like that they, you know, had a pretty strong stance on that of like yeah, like I thought some like big ol orc baddie when I was I was a berserker in the first run that I did and he was also a berserker.
I'm like, we've like almost the same build.
14:33
And it was kind of fun that it was.
It wasn't just like, oh, this is a monster with its own stuff.
It's like, Oh no, I'm going into his tree.
It's like he has that thing.
I also have that thing.
So like, oh, I know exactly what, oh, I need to run away because he's going to be able to rush me like I would normally rush him.
14:50
And he absolutely warmed me and I need to get away.
So it was like kind of I thought it was interesting that like you could go in and you could see every every one of their abilities was an ability that you could find in some tree of some character maybe not one that I hadn't unlocked yet but it existed somewhere.
15:12
And yeah I like it was I I do think you need to have you need to spend a fair amount of time playing it in order to like really rock all the systems because there are a lot of systems that are interacting with each other and it's not the most intuitive like it it doesn't do a really good job of explaining how everything works.
15:31
Like you could find out on the wiki but you know the the further we go into the podcast the more I am like it should be in the game.
It should be you should be able to find stuff in the game and not have to go to the wiki.
We're going to we're going to go to the wiki to find out exactly what the formula is like.
15:48
But like you shouldn't be required to.
So, yeah, but I I, I think the the actual gameplay loop was pretty rewarding, especially, I mean, so maybe I I never got past, I think the highest character I got was like 28.
16:03
So maybe I haven't hit those levels that Will was talking about where you're really grinding through.
But I mean, I put 20 hours into it and I still had an enjoyable time going through those first 25 levels and like, figuring out how to synergize stuff and how these things like, oh, I'm going to only do so many things and to figure out how to, like, have all these synergized together.
16:22
And it was a fun puzzle.
You raise an interesting point.
Or you you point out an interesting feature of this game which I in the six hours did not realize, that everything in the game, every creature that exists in the game, is beholden to the same sort of rules and has access to the same systems.
16:41
That is interesting.
I'm not exactly sure how to sort of summarize how that's interesting, but I don't know.
It's cool that there is a sense of mechanical cohesion across the entire game world.
That and the scenario you're describing with the Barbarian versus Barbarian Rage off sounds pretty cool.
17:04
I can dig it.
Well, I think and.
Then I ran away.
I I ran away and I levelled up.
And then I came back and I absolutely murdered him.
Yeah.
This is one thing that I think Tome kind of excels at.
Once you start opening up things via unlocks is the the diversity with its craziness and it doesn't do it.
17:27
Like, one of my bones to pick with this is that it doesn't do it fast enough.
But again, if there if this game has been out for so long that if there's a thing that you can think of that you would change about this game, there's probably a mod for it that does that.
And for me like having the like unlock all of the available races to pick from and all the available classes just say experiment with and see like what is what's all different in here.
17:52
It was very interesting because the first time that I played through it, this game does have a tutorial mode and on this podcast we'd like to shout out when games do tutorial modes.
But oh man, like I don't know this, like the tutorial for this game just felt so boring.
18:08
Like it it it, it does its job.
It's like click here to do this.
This is an enemy.
You will bump into them to attack them.
This is how you click a thing from your Diablo style skill menu to kill them and stuff.
It does all that stuff fine, but I don't think it's it's it's presented maybe too safely and it doesn't like.
18:28
It doesn't show you the vast diversity of craziness that goes on in this game.
Like I think when you first boot it up you have access to you know like your basic warrior classes, your basic Archer classes.
I think you get the road by default.
I can't remember but but you get like the arch mage class I think by default.
18:48
No, no alchemist, but well I think you unlock the arch mage pretty fast.
I think it's probably one of the first unlocks and the the starting like mission for the other.
The other classes are kind of all or is it?
Is it race space?
Now I'm getting confused.
Anyway, let's let's start with how your story begins in this game.
19:06
Depending on what race or class you pick, you can either have maybe the most boring vanilla intro to a fantasy game you've ever played, or you are starting in outer space jumping from asteroid to asteroid with the Earth in the background and you are zapping monsters to their doom to save the celestial plane as your first mission.
19:32
And that's that's kind of this game in a nutshell is like it can it can present itself at first as maybe like the most mid vanilla boring looking palette you've ever seen.
But just under the surface of that is like this like party snake style surprise of insanity that I don't know if anyone else has had.
19:55
Like the different starts to experiment with, but I went with my play experience.
I went very wide instead of deep like Will.
I was trying to experiment with as many little systems as I could and each one of those different starting styles was very was very neat to me.
You don't see that very often especially with with something like an open world experience like this.
20:14
But Colin, you had you played a dwarf character, right?
I did, yeah.
You start in a completely different spot.
You start in like deep in the underground fighting your way out from from something and then your your second, like I don't think you can go to those you like.
20:30
You can't go to the dwarf city unless you start as a dwarf.
It's like not.
It's like it's also it gives you some weird text about like you need something to breathe here or something.
It's just like a, some, some like you.
You're not allowed to be in this spot.
But yeah, I mean that was my first character too.
20:46
So I was like oh, I just kind of assumed that everyone had like a cool, weird underground plot related mission start.
And then like my second characters were the like most vanilla human John, John Deere, the Summoner, summoning all of his dear friends.
21:03
And the human or halfling start is just like, you're in the woods, no plot, nothing really.
Just like, go fight some stuff.
Going into adventure.
At the end, yeah, yeah, you go, you're.
Inspired.
It says you're inspired by, like the tales of old and like glory and gold and all that stuff, to go out to the Wilds and find some of that adventure for yourself.
21:29
And if you're yeah, if you're a human or a halfling, I believe you go into the forest and your first quest is to find and defeat a troll, which the the exact troll that you fight is is randomized.
Sometimes you will fight Bill the stone troll or you will fight one of his friends whose name I forget and that's I I appreciated that there was a little bit of variety, but I will agree that that is not a super exciting start.
21:59
Furthermore, navigating through the 1st 2 levels of that, the first, pardon me, the first two sections screens of that forest and having to replay it, which you will be doing because it is a rogue like with permadeath.
Neat permadeath mechanics.
22:14
We'll get to that, I'm sure, But you are rolling re rolling a lot, at least in my situation, and you're having to replay this God forsaken.
Horrible to.
Navigate screen 'cause it's not it's.
22:30
You have 8 directions of movement.
It's.
It's grid based movement of course, right directions and the need to move diagonal and press West and D at the same time, or West and A or what have you to both move in between like trees that are set out on a grid.
22:50
Moving diagonally and attacking diagonally is a nightmare.
Basically, Andrew, people, people are screaming in their cars right now saying you're supposed to be using the keypad to move.
What are you doing?
Interesting.
My keyboard yes, but isn't rest?
Isn't weight set to #5 on the keypad by default?
23:07
Yeah, cuz you're moving, you're moving down.
On your mind board.
But in Collins case, this is one thing that kind of bugs me is like.
Well, then why did they bother?
Why did they bother?
Mapping WASD, of course, I'm playing APC game.
My whatever.
23:22
All right, right.
Well, I wasn't in the right traditional rogue, like, well, space.
Everyone knows the only the only key you need is Z.
Auto explorer.
That's correct.
That's correct.
I was about to get to that Auto explorer.
Incredible.
Let's have Auto explorer in every game is what I'm saying.
23:37
It would have definitely helped me when I was playing some old like fan made ASCII graphics.
Rogue likes great stuff.
Auto Explorer just takes you to the next point of interest.
Your character runs around the grid and you stop on loot or monsters.
And then you.
Don't even stop on loot and just picks it up and just keeps running.
23:55
Keeps.
He picks it up.
I don't know if I had the auto pickup set up.
Transmod verification chest, I was supposed.
To be using the number I was supposed to be using my separate you ever?
Get the twist.
I think you start with that.
Don't.
You.
Oh, I I got it.
I never used it.
I it was like I don't understand what this does.
24:11
I can store stuff in it, but I need to also save stuff out of it.
I don't.
Just auto sells everything for you.
Oh.
OK.
How do I?
That's neat.
That's cool.
That's handy.
It's kind of like.
It's kind of like.
Torchlight or it's like well, because at the end of?
Send stuff out.
At the end of every stage.
24:28
So each each dungeon that you go in typically has like about 3:00-ish levels or stages to it.
And at the end of each one of these levels, you go up and down a a stair or you go to the next part of the forest or something.
And the loop that you've picked up, your trans mog chest will pop up saying, all right, this is the stuff that you picked up.
24:47
It's highlighted what what do you want to keep?
And 99% of it is junk.
And you're just like, yeah, just auto sell it.
Which solves maybe one of the biggest gripes I have about Diablo and other action RPG games is like, yeah, I picked up all this loot.
I got a teleport back to town.
25:03
I got to go find the vendor.
I got to go like, sell all the stuff to the vendor, OK, now I've got my gold.
Now I got to go back in Battlefield.
And then it just like, bam.
It just streamlines that process.
Like it or it shortcuts it.
Well, maybe not perfectly, but I like the idea of that a whole lot.
25:20
Is neat and I've seen, experimented with, and good good on you.
There are definitely good design ideas here.
I think that the designers are very talented and I think this is a is certainly an achievement of game design.
It's not necessarily my cup of tea, basically.
25:39
Interesting numpad I was supposed to be using.
Numpad it.
Reminds me a lot of like.
That would have solved a lot of my problems.
There's a lot of like traditional robe likes that go out of their way to not use the mouse for some God forsaken reason because it's like the classic meme of like back end coding developers creating a website and it's this Spartan mess of just like awful UI decisions and like that's kind of what you roll the dice with.
26:05
With a lot of traditional rogue like games is stuff like that.
It's very much you could tell a programmer made the thing.
It reminds me a lot of like if you're if you're playing the original Quake and you know how like the original Quake had like the directional button movement instead of like mouse mouse movement and WASD like, sure, by the way there's this whole other peripheral that people use now.
26:27
But I will say that tome plays very well with a you could play the whole game with just a mouse, and it's a very welcome design experience compared.
To this, but it's so slow.
I mean I appreciate that they included the mouse interface.
I think in terms of controls, it's great that they gave you all the different options, including digging through the, you know, closet and getting my USB numpad attachment.
26:49
No, that's not true.
I have a full length keyboard so I I should have.
I should have realized I guess the tutorial even says hey you know, use the use the keypad it says but if.
You're someone like Colin, who builds their own keyboard.
Keypad in the.
I honestly had no trouble clicking both W&C&C.
27:05
Well, I'm.
Glad.
I I.
Just I found it to be kind of tedious to have to do that motion over and over again, so that's why I was happy that the the auto explorer.
Option was so I.
Could just spam that.
Auto Explorer is truly AI mean.
27:21
I feel like it does.
It takes away something of from the game very slightly, but it gives back so much more in the like lack of friction to to to go through things.
Certainly.
Certainly.
It's not as if I I think the way that generally most people are going to play it, or at least the way I played it, so that you use the auto explorer when it moves you and then you know, you know, move around normally.
27:45
Yeah, with WASD or whatever, I imagine whatever you have available to you.
I imagine too that there are certain character classes that it is better or worse for, depending on how you interact with ranged enemies.
So like if you're the Kai, if you're a glass cannon that's going to get sniped by something and you need to be like carefully going around corners or whatever, it might be different than when I was playing Odom the the dwarf berserker and Michael Wood.
28:16
It was like, I don't care that something sees me, I'm going to rush towards it and then deal with it by just smashing it into bits.
Like I don't like.
I don't need subtlety here.
Auto Explorer is my best.
Friend.
There is the the feature of track which is interesting.
28:34
I think it's it's possible that at higher levels you have to just basically sit there until the the the the skill refreshes and take dungeons and and areas very slowly and just hit the track button which basically lets you see where all the enemies are around you for a period of time.
28:49
And so like in a certain radius.
And so if you know that like, oh there's a bunch of if I was to approach this from this angle via like Auto explorer, I would be running into like 3 elites at once.
But if I come from this angle I can like lure one away from the rest of them.
And so that's kind of the advantage I think of taking it slow and not using auto explorer.
29:07
Of course I as an arch mage with a shield which was extremely overpowered by the like by mid game and especially through the end.
No you just hit Z and then you don't even you don't have to move at all.
You just walk into a room you stare at that and you shoot lightning bolts and everything and then they all die.
29:24
And if they run up to you and start smashing your shield, you're just like, what?
What?
I got 6000 more HP on this shield you want to keep.
Bashing it all right, that's fine.
So I'm I'm curious like when when I knew that this that this game was almost doomed for for Will to be playing it because I knew he was going to he was going to open it up for 5 minutes and say this game looks like shit.
29:47
I I hate how it plays and then just like close it after playing it for 20 minutes.
So I considered it a moral victory in that he played it for longer than 20 minutes.
I should have done that.
But but you.
But there was something here that kept you engaged and interested to actually like, I haven't beaten this game.
30:04
I haven't even beaten Dreadfeld Tower yet.
Which I guess is what kind of like the midpoint.
Like, I'm curious what what kind of, like kept you motivated to either, like, were you?
Were you always rerolling the same character of like, OK, I've got now I know how to do that better.
30:19
Or did you try something different every time?
I I think I had like 5 characters overall.
And character archetypes or like 5.
Like just five characters in total.
Yeah, five runs in total.
And I did the Ranger twice.
I did some kind of warrior starting out, I think.
30:37
No, I did the you.
Were you were doing it mostly on the mode that wasn't like true true Rogue?
Like where you you had like.
Playing with.
Lives, so there's.
You get like 5 lives.
Yeah, there's the there's there's more than one game mode.
There's there's like a couple difficulties and there's the true rogue, like Iron Man, Perma death, etcetera.
30:55
And then there's one that's like a kind of a soft, soft perma death where you start off with one life, but then you gain lives at certain level milestones, which I think is probably a better way to play.
Starting off 'cause I I played it, I played the the the true Iron Man mode once and then died in a way that I was like really frustrated by.
31:19
It was like, oh I I made a mistake in how I thought an item worked and then I accidentally clicked and I moved instead of doing anything for my turn and died.
And it was like, oh, that felt super bad, but.
31:35
Have you been at that point you had invested like how many hours into that character?
Like 5, Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway, sorry will you?
Yeah, the the permit that you want to.
Get the screen here.
Normal mode right?
Was that the the multi lives?
Yeah, the the the default venturer.
Mode.
31:50
I think I used in total on the the run that I won.
I used five lives.
I think I was down to my last life and then eventually I got the some item that gives you another life that I didn't end up using.
But it was.
I definitely made a bunch of dumb mistakes as I went through and.
32:06
And I can see why.
Yeah, like having those extra lives when you're learning that.
Like, Oh yeah, when you have an item in your hot bar and you replace that item on your kit, you still have that item on the hot bar.
And when you click it and you're expecting to use it, oh, it turns out you're going to use a full turn to switch your gear and you're going to get absolutely smashed.
32:25
If that was like.
Oh yeah, this is my last ditch.
Shield that's from this, like, SHIELD drink it.
Nope.
Turns out you're dead instead, that's that's the kind of thing that you know that's just a bad UI decision, I think.
Because.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's assuming you can find that part of the action bar anywhere on your screen, depending on what resolution you're set there.
32:46
But we'll get to the UI in a moment.
Your question, Scott, we I, I don't know if we've gotten a a specific answer just yet, or I wasn't paying attention, 'cause I was opening and looking at the game's new game options.
Will, what kept you coming back for 60 hours?
Was it just raw determination to conquer this this challenge?
33:05
I think it's just I didn't have anything better to do.
It's like, I mean I I, I have a bunch of games that are better, but they're like better for like the a certain context, which is like to say, slit, aspire, 'cause I have to mention that every episode, you know, that's my as I'm going to bed, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll, you know play around essentially.
33:23
And it's like great.
But like it's not something I'm going to play like for a long period of time.
And this has still had some novelty value in it.
I think of like, oh, what's going to happen next And Oh my God, that I died to that stupid the master vampire in dreadful, you know, that kind of big, big midway point.
33:38
I'm like, I really want to beat him and so that's something about that got me to grind through and just deal with the suck of getting to him again.
But I in, in in hindsight I probably should just pick up a different game or just done something productive with my life.
33:54
You know, that would have been probably a good decision.
So here's a question.
Here's a question for the group Is this game?
Is this game better for someone who is just coming into this game for the first time?
Is this game better to play on the easiest possible difficulty with no permadeath?
Like like unlimited lives, easiest possible mode?
34:12
Is that a better experience, do we think?
I think you're referring to the exploration.
Mode.
I think regular difficulty is fine, but playing with multiple lives is definitely something I would advise for a new player to coming in.
What about infinite lives?
No, that's bad.
34:29
'Cause one thing, one thing that like befuddles me about tone in particular, is its length.
And I think there is, there's an interesting kind of bifurcation that's happening between these more RPG end of the spectrum, traditional rogue like games where you're investing hours and hours and hours into this character, this build and this run that you have going and you could you could die in any second from this enemy that will just warp in from the beyond the screen and bam, you're dead.
35:02
Versus the other option of something that I think kind of fits the the mold for your perma death grid based old school rogue legs.
Better coffee break rogue legs.
And these are games that are designed to be played basically end to end in 30 minutes to an hour instead of like one run taking 6 to 10 hours we'll say and very much like yeah yeah yeah and you know like there's I guess also the the question of meta progression it unlocks.
35:34
But anyway, like is is, is this idea of RPG long term investment in a character that can be perma killed antithetical to that?
Like, are these are these two different genres that are clashing together?
35:51
Yes, absolutely.
That's the answer Rogue likes should be at most two hours.
I think that, and this is something that it doesn't, it didn't surprise me.
You said this is an old game because that's something that's been learned in the past decade is that you make a Hades style game, you make it, there's a a tight window of just like, alright, it's an hour, it's 40 minutes.
36:10
Ideally 40 minutes to an hour is like the run This 20 hours thing where you're getting wiped in some bullshit thing is Oh my God, that's that's a pain.
That's a pain.
Disagree on.
The exact amount of time, I think that you could push it to like 2 hours, 3 hours without it being like it's really hurting the experience.
36:32
But I do agree with it on unlike the 20 hours like when you get that far into the game and you lose, it does be like the further you get in, the worse it feels.
It's kind of like, so I'm going to bring bring like will, will brings in slaves fire.
I'll bring in D&D.
36:47
Like if if you're a Level 3 character in D&D and your character dies, you're like, oh that's fun, I'll put a new I'll make a new character.
Now if you're level 19 character that you've been playing in your campaign for two years, three years dies in like a stupid way, like, oh, that's brutal.
37:08
So I think that, yeah, the the amount of time you invest in something like definitely changes the vibe of how you experience.
That death, I tend to agree, Colin.
However, there's there's also another distinction there in in that way.
That's a good example and and sort of the experience is similar.
37:24
But there's there's also, I think an interesting difference that is useful to look at, which is when you have a Dungeons and Dragons character die or a tabletop RPG character of any kind die.
I think what makes it not a totally awful experience?
37:41
I mean it can be of course a very rough experience, but what the saving grace is that you are going to get the opportunity to make a new tabletop role-playing game character and you're going to immediately jump into a gaming experience with brand new 100% whole cloth original content.
38:00
Whereas with a rogue like game you are going to have to probably replay some contents and re experience it and that grind to get back to where you were.
In video games is can be very tough and it's it's not as tough that that issue is mitigated by rogue lights that do a really good job of randomizing things so that every experience even early game is like new and novel or in games like like you mentioned Will that are specifically designed from the ground up to have a quick and like tight game cycle that's like short and set and and and and good.
38:36
Yeah and the part of my personal tome frustration in my gameplay experience was that grind to get back to where I was.
So my level, my character, I'm, I'm double checking my screenshot, looks like I got to level 8.
38:52
When I lost that character at level 8, I was pretty this I I I was pretty bummed out.
Especially since it was a feel bad death, kind of a moment where it's like I thought the game worked a certain way and I apparently misunderstood and it was only like a couple hours in, but he was like, Oh no.
39:11
Perma death mode.
We we we did a bad job of letting you do that.
Well I I was doing the the adventurer mode where you have the the the set you know you have a certain limit and you gain more that I as far as I can tell that's the default and I think that system is interesting and good as to the subject of like as to the subject of perma death games or near perma Death games that are really long.
39:37
So the you know the the opposite of Hades.
I think that there's something to be said for that long form gameplay experience and having the drama and the tension of knowing I'm only going to get one shot you know and it's only got one life.
39:54
There's something to be said for that experience and some games capture it and it's really amazing.
But it is tricky and designers have to be careful.
And I, I, and.
I think that though this game was probably designed the way it was, again because of the age as we've discussed.
40:12
Yeah, I have a proposed solution for this game specifically at those markers, those milestones where you get to get an extra life, maybe add a checkpoint, a save game, maybe not that is exact, those exact milestones, but have some kind of milestone save game I think would be a great mod.
40:27
Somebody should maybe have that.
I mean, there probably is a mod for that probably.
But yeah, Quick Save mod does.
That take away from the tension then like.
I think the like the kickback.
I think it it depends on the player, yeah.
Yeah, like the the kickback to previous save still has that, like gut wrenching feeling of like, oh man, I lost like that much progress.
40:50
Do I really want to start over again versus like OK now I know what I did wrong for like the past 10 hours.
Great.
I can go back.
I have the safety net.
Like it's it's probably something that varies between different people.
So the the character history that I have in this game, Colin, I also started off with Odom the the Lightning Bore Bulwark.
41:14
And then I I cribbed your your current D&D character, Lars Gibbon, the cursed halfling.
Which I think I shot myself in the foot on that one because I believe in very big hairy feet that were shot and cause in tone.
I believe halflings rely a lot on the Lux stat and the cursed class deliberately gives you a penalty to that.
41:35
So I think I was basically playing with one hand behind my my.
One hot, tiny torso, if you will.
And then after that I played Anakin Skywalker the cursed hired Cornac human and I didn't realize at the time I was using like a two handed sword and I had basically no defense and I kept wondering why am I dying all the time.
41:54
And then eventually I lost all of my lives and I died picking up a one or a pretty decent shield but too little too late and I was I have I currently do have the option to save scum at back like 10 levels.
But I'm not going to because I'm like, well, it's perma death.
42:09
And I have like, there's so much other stuff to explore in this game.
Like I don't really need, like the draw for me is not so much like, oh, I have to go and like and beat the final boss to be like, done with it.
It's more of like understanding the different classes and systems and things and seeing what like, interesting puzzles that I have to solve as a result of that.
42:31
So the next, the next one after that was a human Oozmancer named Ivan Ooz.
And I played that one on the easiest possible difficulty with no perma death.
And it it like that character class is fun.
But that tension that was lacking of like, well, like, I can just play as sloppy as I want because there's no perma death.
42:48
There's no consequences to me screwing up here.
And so after that I started playing TikTok the The Human chronomancer and whoa Nelly is the craziness level turned up to 11 I think if if these classes were unlocked earlier so you could see like whoa like this is like something you've never seen in a game that like you were literally creating like a it's like save scum as a video game mechanic where you are going into a quote UN quote parallel timeline.
43:21
You are killing an enemy there, and then you're coming back to your original timeline and deleting them out of existence from the game.
It's a it's like, I don't know if I'm describing that right, but your raised eyebrows are like.
This is this part of the game.
Yeah, like this is a thing that I'm like this stuff needs to be not quite front and center, but like you maybe have like 2-2 of your bog standard fantasy classes and then something weird like like the Oozmancer or the chronomancer, 'cause they're so they're so different.
43:53
And like I'm wrapping my head around like any one of these new mechanics that comes out, I'm like, what does this even mean?
Because like other games like this where you are like, OK, I'm gonna pick the minotaur class and I'm gonna all right, I've got a two handed axe and I'm walking on these grids and I'm bumping it and stuff.
44:09
Great.
I've seen this 100 times before.
Like, I'm not traveling through time in those games this.
It's like it's turning my brain inside out.
I'm like this is like it's it's so interesting and different that this is what draws me to to try to like OK that character died great.
44:26
I want to try this class of of halfling weird looking Yeti people that have been tortured by or no, they were tortured by the halflings and kept as slaves for experimentation.
I want to try him with a mage class.
44:43
Let's go.
Let's see what happens.
And to Andrew, I think your point about like, oh, it's the same grind all over again, a missed opportunity.
I think here is that instead of grinding the same zones that you go through over and over again, if it was a different selection of zones every run like oh, in this, in this run I don't have the option to go to the troll mire because the spell Blaze has blown it up.
45:08
And that's not even an option in this run because I mean like this this game I think is is also specifically designed against anti grinding which is something you see in these older traditional world likes a lot is like potions, there's no potions, enemies don't respond.
45:24
So enemies themselves are almost kind of a conserved resource.
And yeah like there's there's just there's so much experimentation to go on.
Will I do want to ask you, we we had our good buddy Davian right into the program.
Hello.
45:40
And he wanted to get your input because you had mentioned last time about seven days to die and those points of interest.
And in this game in tome, when you're exploring a dungeon there's maybe a similar idea with vaults where you come to a a door it says you've come across a sealed door.
45:58
Are you sure you want to open that?
And maybe to summarize Davian's e-mail, where do you see like that kind of importance here?
And like as some as the only person here who's beating the game, so you are our de facto expert.
Open the vault or don't open the vault.
46:17
Well, you you open the vault until you get to level 50 and you just want to beat the fucking game, and then you try and find the exit to get to the next floor as fast as possible and ignore everything else.
That was kind of my strategy.
So it was it was interesting and useful early on but they're just so many like I got I was I was over it.
46:35
I I didn't want to fight another elite.
I just wanted because it's if I find another elite what that means I have to do is I have to hit like five more hotkeys and so regular dudes you just run in there and just you know you know one hockey 2.
Hotkeys 3.
But it is more prep required for like anything that would be in in one of these tome rooms and yeah, I don't think the tome you have to like pre.
46:56
Summoner you have to pre summon things.
For those, make sure that all your good summons are out so you can like open the door and then keep yourself away.
Well, I mean I went with that.
The lightning arch mage was nothing like that.
There was no you you basically the only question was how much shield do I need.
47:13
And if I need more shield than in the beginning you have to like activate several Shields and then suddenly you walk in like I said with like 6-7 thousand of shield, which I know by by the end of that it's it's it's it's basically means that like nothing can touch you.
47:32
I don't.
I never had that shield broken, essentially by the end game.
Well, am I to understand that you were playing the spellcaster equivalent of the Enterprise, the USS Enterprise?
Yeah, I was like shield.
I felt this thing Shields up every time.
Like, you know, it's just like it.
47:48
It's.
They're targeting us with lasers.
So and that is, yeah, I think, obviously, I mean you didn't ask me the question, but there's a lot of these games, a lot of modern Rd. likes or even, you know, older Rd. likes their form of randomization is not 100%, you know, procedural.
48:12
It is a collection, a library of modules pre you know prefabricated rooms and areas that are then shuffled and like put together like in Enter the Gungeon is a is a great example.
Crypt of the Necro Dancer is a great example.
48:29
Or even our past episode nightmare.
Reaper.
Nightmare Reaper, of course.
Yes, yes, yes.
And that is a pretty great solution.
And it sounds like tome does something kind of similar in having this library of Vault modules.
And you get, you know, the best of both worlds in that you get randomization and so a unique experience and path for the player to explore.
48:54
But you also get finely tuned, meaningfully and deliberately designed sections that a designer has gone in and tweaked and refined and made into an enjoyable experience.
So you get, you get the, yeah, you get the randomness, but you also get the crafted experience.
49:14
I'm not sure that's exactly what the vaults were.
But I wish they were well, I said.
They did that a little bit.
I guess it was my.
My well, the vaults.
The vaults are are you're.
Single rooms, right?
Yeah, like they're basically single rooms.
They have some pretty like decently tiered loot in there.
You open it up and it is a monster factory of if if you were in that dungeon at that specific level, you open it up.
49:35
There's guys in there maybe like.
I.
Definitely four or five level times.
But I I just, I thought perhaps maybe later in the game they are larger than just like a single room.
There, I think there are some that are larger 'cause I do remember in my previous playthrough like encountering something like like this.
49:53
I'm like, yeah, of course I want to open this thing and then it being kind of like a long a long hallway and then like some branching segments off of it, be like oh OK And then just getting like surrounded by like 2 tile tall ice giants who are just hurling boulders at me until I die.
50:10
Yeah, but the tutorial told you not to get surrounded.
You said.
That you said that, that's a shame.
That's a shame.
Classic classic.
It's true.
It's true.
Say I I have a with regards to the controls.
50:28
I just.
I just wanted to mention that I do again, I I I can conceptualize of this idea of like really getting into the game and having your key bindings down and having both hands on the keyboard and just going away doing this gameplay loop.
You've got, you know, your build in mind, you know what to do, you know, you've memorized all the buttons.
50:45
I started to get that feeling with my level 8 character, like I was using the mouse and keyboard, but like, you know, I knew the exact combination.
I had my rotation down on the on the action bar and that rhythm was getting to feel quite nice around the time I got killed.
51:03
So like again, I can, I can understand and logically I can logically process how this game is is fun once you get into it and for certain types of players.
Yeah, there's Yeah, there is a lot of stuff in this game.
Maybe I should re edit this part to the start of the podcast, but let's see, we talked about there's a bunch of classes.
51:26
There's like 12 overarching themes of character classes.
There's 37 of them in total, plus DLCS.
You have 16 different races.
There's from your Diablo style skills that you can pick from.
There are 1505 unique versions of those.
51:47
So there's there's quite a lot.
There's all sorts of like weird resources also.
So instead of like your standard action RPG, of like you have your your life bar on the right and your mana bar on the left and have fun being.
Held up by a devil and Angel respectively.
52:03
Yeah, exactly.
My my Anakin Skywalker Hearst human I had.
I had to keep my hate meter filled at all times in order to get.
The Anakin on brand.
The 8M Combo Matic.
Had to keep the the hate high and the high ground low through.
52:21
You.
Yeah.
And this is interesting because it creates this decision element against Auto Explorer, because when you're walking around and you're not killing all of the women and children, I killed them all, you're losing hate.
52:38
And this is very important for Anakin.
He must be hateful at all times.
So whenever you kill an enemy, you get more hate, and whenever you're walking around, you're losing hate.
And if you're at maximum hate, you get a bunch of these great bonuses associated with it.
So I was walking around thinking like OK, I can't Auto Explorer, but I know that this stage that I'm in, the boss at this stage is always at the bottom of the screen or like this dungeon.
53:00
And so I basically beelined to like either follow like the critical path of the level to get down there and just making sure I was like constantly bashing monsters the whole time to keep my hate meter up.
Get to the boss, aha, I've got you now and then just hate slice them in half, no problem.
53:18
There's other and I think I briefly talked about it but like the the the chronomancer class if Tenet was a video game like you have it one of the one of the subclasses you have a resource called Paradox and I.
So writers write into the podcast when I'm getting this wrong.
53:35
But I believe it works this way where you basically set like your your level apps to how much Paradox power you have and you can define like how how powerful do you want to be.
And the risk reward here is that the more spells you use, the more your Paradox meter increases.
53:52
If it goes beyond a certain threshold for your level, you can't control paradox anymore.
And so you start like, I want to click this button to use the spell.
Well you've like created a problem in the space-time continuum.
Have you teleported like 5 spaces to the right and like, OK well I would like to put my shield up.
54:08
Oh, you've created a rift in the space-time continuum and you've summoned in like 5 allied dwarves to your side from a parallel dimension who are very like.
The description is like they are very confused as to where they are right now and so stuff like that is is like very there.
54:25
There's another race I haven't tested out yet that has like you're supposed to be like constantly balancing out like light and dark magic constantly.
And like these are all super creative things that that you don't see in other like boring fantasy grid based, ASCII art grid bumpers as they are.
54:45
Like it's it's so creative and interesting that like that's that's the draw for me.
Here is like all this, all this stuff, but also how unique and different it is.
I think that's great.
I I, I I agree with you on that.
I think they have a lot of interesting classes and I noticed that just in playing the the several that I did, that there was definitely a different feel to each of them and it was interesting to try and discover it.
55:09
And I'm sure there's within each class, there's probably many different ways of choosing talents to even like, you know bring out certain aspects of it.
So I think that's all.
That's all makes sense.
If, if only the game was like like if if it was if the eastern island didn't exist, if it was just that and then dreadful, then we're talking about like you know maybe like it's like 8 to 10 hours.
55:31
I think actually maybe it down to five at the like.
Then you're you get an interesting playthrough.
By the time you get to 25 anyways or so you like your your build basically complete and so just like yeah just cut the game in half.
Less is more here I think.
And then you can explore all these more interesting aspects of the game which is like all the different types of characters.
55:50
And yeah, because if it's 20 hours to beat it and you have how many different characters and you want me to play through all the characters, that's just what do you what do I guess that's why the average time is 100 and how many hours 129 is?
What?
What was my what was my careful lawyering of referring these Yeah, like your, your average player of this game has 128.92 hours in it.
56:10
Yeah, but you're you're what kind?
Of have is that that mean?
The best part?
That's the That's the median.
The The 90th median, the 90th percentile, 90th percentile of people who play this game have 1008 and 88 hours in it.
Yeah, I mean, I could absolutely see a a slightly different version of Will that just is like instead of playing Slay the Spire on his monitor with TNG and the the other monitor while he's going to bed, he could just be playing this and gets, you know, an hour a night in for three years in a row.
56:40
Can we talk about the music?
I kind of like the music in this game.
Am I?
Am I the outlier?
Here.
Incorrect.
It's upsettingly bad.
What?
No, it's.
Really really repetitive.
And also the sound effects are in villages are weird and there's a little dog that barks in the background and a glass catter.
56:57
Incredibly, Incredibly, let's not forget The Hawk.
That hawk.
Oh man, that hawk sent me.
It's like, folks, we get the Sprite coming in.
It's moving at the wrong angle, like it doesn't even make sense.
And it has a little shadow being cast on the ground.
It's really cute.
And then, yeah, like and oh boy, I was immersed, let me tell ya.
57:17
It was actually in there I I just heard the sound effect.
I didn't, actually.
See.
Oh, it's there.
Oh, I saw it twice.
It was awesome.
And both times I was reminded of there was a Counter Strike 1.6 level that was like it.
I think it was a custom map, but it looked, it was very professionally done and there was a section where it was like a Grand Canyon type of a layout.
57:35
And above the Canyon you could see a bird flying around and the bird was just a texture that was just sort of floating around on a preset track and it reminded me of that.
And I was oh so delighted.
And then I got distracted from the game for like 1/2 hour and went and played Counter Strike 1.6 which was a delight and I had to go.
57:55
Back to the same.
Level.
No, sorry.
That just speaks to my personal, you know?
Personal.
I think video games, the, the point about the music being repetitive is is true.
Because when I was going, going and trying to find music selections to play this episode out with, I'm like, you know, I think I had a pretty good time with the music.
58:14
And then I found the soundtrack posted up on YouTube.
And yeah, they're all like like a minute long.
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, like.
Actually, yeah, you're right.
I I won't say that the music is bad, but it it it, it plays, they're short and they're they loop really.
58:30
Yeah, quickly.
Which wouldn't be a problem if if you weren't spending more than like 5 minutes in like a whole dungeon.
But you could.
You could probably spend like 1/2 hour in each dungeon if you're like making sure to be very tactical and thoughtful about your play.
And then yeah, like if it's the same.
58:47
Well, I'm spending 5 minutes comparing items, trying to use the very, very bad item comparison thing and it's playing in the background.
And I'm getting frustrated because I'm frustrated at comparing the items because they I just want them to the side by side.
And then the the music is just repeating in the background and it's it's and then that dog is barking because we're in like some weird city and it's just in the background.
59:10
It's but it's so quiet that you're like, I took me, it took me a second like to realize that it was part of the game.
I thought there was just a dog barking in my apartment because it's just like this soft, weird, like muffled dog bark sound in the background of the one like Elf Village or something.
59:29
So you're saying you were totally immersed in this game, is what you were saying?
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying, correct.
Full immersion.
Like I may I may have well been wearing the the Apple VR headset in the world of Mahja El.
Would you be doing that with the the old RPG tile set or the standard graphics?
59:49
I I mean, I only played with whatever the game came with.
I didn't find the graphics to be that.
Bad.
All right, so folks, I'd like to start.
This is a wonderful topic to to bring up.
But first, real quick, hey, you know, they didn't have a whole Dang sound department working on this thing.
1:00:05
You know, you should maybe cut them some slack.
That being said, yeah, the music is.
I'm on the will team.
I don't care if you're a single person developed.
Oh, here comes the cock.
Whoa, I miss.
Family show here.
This podcast is rated E E for educational.
1:00:22
Sometimes a hawk is just a hawk, but in this case it's a cock hawk.
All right folks, I have a screenshot.
It's coming at you of this beautiful, this beautiful piece of artwork which is is relatively charming.
There are a few pieces of art that are kind of charming.
1:00:38
Generally I like the the menus and the UI kind of like like well enough I would say.
Yeah, I would say like the the art.
Like the all right on the discord.
Check that out.
Oh, oh.
I see it's a screenshot of the Hawk, yes.
Yeah, I have the game open right now and I just got so excited that I was going to be able to capture.
1:00:58
Building is absolutely hideous.
Do you see that building, by the way?
I'm just it's in the screen that you just reminded me like that was like upsettingly bad to see buildings like with that design, see.
You know.
I don't care.
I don't care at all.
Like it does.
1:01:13
It gets the point across like it this just feels like it's it's theater of the mind in many ways.
Like I'm not.
A.
A mind like that of the main character from Nightmare Reaper, our last game.
A addled person in need of assistance in crisis?
1:01:31
No.
Sorry, please continue like I I'm I'm pretty good at imagining things.
Like I read books, the the graphical.
Books.
Are really bad.
Whoa.
Like, these are better graphics than a book.
I don't think that they are better graphics than the human mind, the most sophisticated and impressive computer in existence.
1:01:52
Andrew, that's why you played on ASCII mode exclusively, right?
Is there an ASCII mode?
There is, yeah.
Like our childhood, like you're looking at the graphics and you're like, OK, this is not the thing that's happening, this is a representation of things, and my mind is filling in the actual action that's occurring.
I think that we are discussing a pretty subjective thing, but I think there's a one could it would not be outrageous to say this game is objectively ugly.
1:02:23
I think something that softened my opinion on it a bit was when I discovered that it was officially launched in in 2012.
And so I was like, all right, well, let me put myself on a 2012 mindset.
And I'm like, I guess.
It's 2020, 10 even.
I wouldn't have thrown up immediately upon seeing this, like if it was on like a bubbly like CRT screen.
1:02:41
I don't know why you'd have a CRT screen, but like an old timey.
What was the average monitor?
Like screens by then?
I guess that's true.
I had a 20 like I had a 24 inch monitor by that time, but I don't think the resolution was especially high.
1:02:58
Anyway, I I I gave it a little bit more.
Folks.
Listen folks at home, the bottom line, the ultimately, I think the issue with this game for me visually is that it is a very sort of like incoherent and a a a graphic style that lacks cohesion.
1:03:15
No, no, no.
It has lots of cohesion.
This is every single Sprite, every single property of this entire game could fit into a 14 year olds fantasy art portfolio.
I mean, we're talking amateur grade, like it all fits into that sort of like level, right?
1:03:31
I I I think I agree but maybe not quite like it's this is the the art style here is that Italian Jesus repainting failure that happened where like it is it is it is bad but but but it has heart.
1:03:51
It is heart bad not boring bad.
And an example of boring bad is the Steam release of ancient domains of mystery that I linked to, where like, the art there, like, is functional.
It's clear you can see what's happening.
That's fine.
1:04:07
But all the characters look like, you know, chibi, like mobile, like mobile art with like the the cartoonishly like big head and smaller bodies.
And like, it's just like like boring bad art.
To me, like that is worse than like bad, bad art, which is what we have here, 'cause this, like the art here I think is like is bad, but it's like it's entertainingly bad.
1:04:29
I feel like it's it's not focused on being good, which is fine.
It's it's it's placeholder for use your imagination to imagine a vibrant, magical world that is happening in the text and the descriptions of how.
Things are that feels like an extra like hurdle almost for the player like you need to overcome these these visuals to to force your brain into here's here's a this is a traditional rogue life.
1:04:59
Would you like it better if it were ASCII art?
No, maybe I I legitimately am.
Let's.
Assume that there's some way to make it so that, like my my criticism, ASCII is generally it's hard for me to grok what is happening.
1:05:15
I can't look at it and like, quickly know where things are or what things are.
Like is this lower case M mine or is it a minotaur?
Right, exactly.
If if you could figure that out quickly, but other than that it was representational, would that make this better or worse?
1:05:33
Better I would better than asking to.
Cog Mind.
No, no better than better than the current graphics.
I I would say Cog Mind is a good example of having extremely simplistic art but it is presented in a stylized and engaging way.
1:05:49
Yeah, but it's yeah, it's a great question.
Straight up ASCII probably not.
But if it was some kind of really rudimentary graphics that were clear and and and representational as you said, I think that'd be great.
I but I also kind of agree or I don't know, I I'm torn on this.
1:06:07
I think the I think the R.
Reacted when I first opened.
It I think the R Yeah, like rightfully is going to push a lot of people away when they come to this Steam trailer page and being like whoa, this is not for me.
And I think if there was an A a mod pack or something that just took like the art as or like the base tiles as they were and just AI upscaled them using some theme or something like Greg Rotowski, chronomancer, what have you then like that I think is is something that could be more palatable to the general gaming audience.
1:06:43
Obviously if someone is Google searching for Tales Of Montreal, they're probably not in the same category of people who are, you know, have their only other experience is Binding of Isaac or Slay the Spire or something.
Great point, great point.
And I I think at the end of the day it's fun to kind of goof on this artwork especially, especially some of the animals.
1:07:03
Oh boy, I'm I'm copy pasting the fox for everyone's enjoyment here.
The fox was fine.
The.
Fox was fine.
I'm pretty sure I felt like the fox was totally acceptable.
At the end of the day, it would have won the Fox.
You're totally right.
You can look at the graphics and you understand what's going on.
1:07:20
And that is arguably the first, the most important look at that guy.
Is he?
Is he living fox, or is he?
Is he?
Wrote little tongue blipping out.
That is a taxidermied fox if.
I now on the other end of the spectrum, we've got one of my favorite sprites, which is the Dragon Halfling.
1:07:41
What is this, the United Kingdom's Halfling patrol?
We just have like 3 happy guys that look like sort of a colorized, upscaled version of like the like Chad beta meme kind.
Of almost equally bad Those are all, Yeah, very much.
They're bad, but you're they illustrate the point that Scott pointed out that this, this, the art is maybe not technical.
1:08:01
It doesn't.
It lacks technical excellence, but it certainly has heart.
It's like, it's like, you know, those medieval paintings that people did before, They like, it's like a cat with just like a human base on it, 'cause they didn't understand what a cat base was like.
It's like one step between that and like the bad Jesus, like painting in that.
1:08:21
Like you know that like again if this game, like took that turn of like OK, well the cohesive art style we're gonna do is that like Bad Bayou Tapestry comedic effect, then like yeah, lean into that more like that could that could be interesting.
But like there's so much stuff going on that yeah.
1:08:38
Like I will say the times that I've gotten to the the ice mountain volcano stage even with the default graphics like the ice giants there, they just look like that.
That looks like something legitimately terrifying.
And the like if I turned around the corner and I saw even just like that base tile art of like A22 tile stall tall ice giant throwing a boulder at me legit.
1:09:02
Like I've opened those doors.
I've seen like the vaults filled with them legitimate fear moment.
And like the the base art for like some of the Dragons.
I think like some like it's it's pretty good.
It's just inconsistent and it does not put its best foot forward at the beginning where like your your standard dwarf or your standard human or your standard elf art is bad.
1:09:24
And like if if like casual gamers are going from your your mid rogue light game with all like these like fancy graphics like coming from Dead Cells to this like of course people are gonna like spoon their eyeballs out.
Which you probably could do in this game because you can't target yourself with attacks.
1:09:44
And as we learned, there are like 1000 different unique Diablo style abilities.
I just wanna say real quick, yeah so taste in game art.
Super subjective, going to vary from person to person.
What's an objective problem with this art is does not play well.
1:10:00
This game does not play well in my experience with like modern resolutions.
At modern resolution it's way too big.
I can't read anything.
Also the graphics are way too tiny.
I found that if I set it to a really low resolution it up, it's sort of quote UN quote upscaled or zoomed in the screen in such a way that like the sprites weren't horribly distorted.
1:10:18
But then my hot bar disappeared and like I I played for the 1st 30 minutes.
I have an exact experience in the will that you had where it's like why does the hot bar start at you know the #0 where's 12345?
And that's oh, that's because they those numbers exist 6 inches off of my monitor at the.
1:10:36
Moment didn't have any of these problems that you guys had.
It just, well, half of us had.
Problems it is.
It is kind of an interesting problem where like these games are so classically designed, they're not really designed with like modern systems in mind to some extent.
I will say, I will say to this game's defense, it did play very well natively on the Steam deck, which you would think that like, yeah, like a platform that you would think that like would not have anything to do with this style of game.
1:11:04
Like you can't.
Like playing Cog Mind on the Steam deck may be possible with an upcoming update in the future.
We'll see.
I'll report back.
But like it played out-of-the-box like very well and being able to install work Steam Workshop mods very streamlined and intuitive.
1:11:20
And like I I played almost all of my 20 hours this past couple weeks, like almost entirely on the Steam deck.
And I think, like, it worked really well for that.
Just imagine out on the couch, turn it in time watching TV, put on an episode of Veep, and then just like in between laughs, like move your character around a little bit.
1:11:38
Works perfectly.
Wow, that is swell.
And not unlike last spell.
I think this would be, for the right player, a really great airplane game.
I I was just playing it on the airplane this morning as I was coming back to the Seattle area.
1:11:53
There you go.
You put in the airplane mode.
Yeah, like it is.
It works very well.
And do.
You do you would you like a a Pepsi or orange juicer and you're like, ah, my paradox level, it's too high.
Leave it alone and it just.
Splashes you with time juice and you warp onto the wing of the plane, or where the wing of the plane will be by the time you fall down out of the sky.
1:12:16
Holy moly, I gotta get this mod that unlocks all the classes I mean.
I just posted this other image to the chat here.
Did any of you get to the dating part of the game?
Excuse me?
What?
Excuse me?
Yeah, no, This is why I wanted to add this extra.
1:12:32
This is just like, Oh my God, you could definitely tell it's the 14 year old essentially mindset who not only made the art, but they're also like oh man, I want this game to have like, you know I want to be able to date someone in it.
So they there's this like whole mission dedicated to this like dating this this girl essentially.
1:12:48
And and there's like a kissing that you do and they have this beach scene and I've dropped this image in the chatting, but like there's a woman in a bikini, like this little pixelized bikini woman that you're like protecting on the beach and.
Meanwhile, your character's in full.
Armor.
1:13:05
Like the teacher bro.
Why is there a woman in A and you could barely tell.
Really is the pixels, but like.
Oh my God.
In the character creation you can customize your characters appearance and you can pick a well actually this speaks to an issue in the game.
1:13:22
In the character creation, I realized it's an old game so it wasn't really you know, in vogue being done.
But the fact there's you know in the character creation only binary options are disappointing and by binary I'm referring to the gender binary options that there's only male and female but also the binary of picking bikini or mankini.
1:13:40
Those are two options and the character customization.
One's like the pink bikini that we're seeing on screen and the other is like a potato sack basically.
But you can apparently as a goof, they put those in there.
You can play the whole game in a swimsuit and if you beat the game in the swimsuit you get like an extra achievement, which I'm sure Will will be angling for this coming two week period and he'll talk about it on the next episode.
1:14:04
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this is maybe the the risk you run with an open source game is maybe.
I don't know if we can attribute this to the to the lead dev, but someone's got to approve it for those those pull requests.
So yeah, I think like, it's it's doubly hilarious because the art is so.
1:14:24
I did not realize there was a beach blanket bingo quest.
I kept running into the you know, please escort me.
I'm lost in the troll woods.
But I did not encounter the the Beach Extravaganza surf Party that is most impressive.
Hey, I got a question for y'all or I have a proposal My my proposal for fixing the safe system.
1:14:46
Not, not the best, but here's my proposal for fixing your mindset about this artwork.
So I'd like to I'd like to bring everyone's attention to the to the main menu, you know, screen that we're.
I'm sure if you're all familiar with, you've got sort of in the middle, standing in this hallway in this dungeon, our adventurer.
1:15:05
How how would you describe the the class of this adventurer Colin?
You know who I'm talking about.
Are you talking about the static static splash screen?
Static splash screen, Yeah, he's got a wizard hat on.
He's like multi classing it up.
Looks pretty.
Heroic looks pretty cool.
I think the art for that adventurer, Yeah, I think the art for that is pretty cool cuz like it invokes mystery like you're going.
1:15:26
I think, like AI, think this is probably the best splash art for the game.
It sets the tone.
I agree.
I agree overall.
But there's a few details that I think are a little bit wonky and this will get to my my solution for the for the visuals, this guy.
So he's got a sword, he's got a lanch, and he's got some boots.
1:15:41
He's wearing for a reason, really a a witch's hat.
In the foreground we see some enemies, a tiny little jawa, a a hooded figure with two knives and and little red eyes.
Looks looks like a little animatronic goofball, a random snake for some reason in the foreground.
1:15:58
Among counter snakes, yeah.
Basically, looking at this image, is there any reason for anybody looking at it to not believe that the setting of Tales of Magial is in fact a spirit Halloween?
So if you think of the whole game.
Existing in a spirit.
Halloween verse.
1:16:14
I think that that answers a lot of questions about the oddness in the visual style.
That is all, Thank.
You That would explain all of the the Anakin Skywalker costumes, that's true travelling and the the Bad Jesus painting things that you run into.
Indeed, indeed.
1:16:29
So I'm I'm glad that yes, there is, you know, artwork to be like, hey, you know, you're looking at an abstraction in the actual gameplay.
But like, let's not forget, this is, this is, this is the the world, this is the reality of what's, you know, going on, being represented.
You know what, I I think I just identified what is wrong about all the art.
1:16:47
Like just of all the people at it anyways, it's just that the arms are too short.
They if you have your hand extended it should extend to the middle of your your thigh.
And these people all are all just like they have.
Their arms are just a little too short and it looks a bit odd.
1:17:04
Could.
Be, could be.
And I'm sure this artist as, oh just gotten, you know, leaps and bounds better than this.
And I'm sure give it an opportunity to do a a remaster.
It'd be swell.
Or they don't care, and that's fine too.
That's also fine, absolutely.
1:17:21
Should we do some ranking boys?
Is it?
Is it tome for rankings?
Oh my God, you know, I've been, I've been calling it all week.
The the tomes of Taj Mahal.
That's how I remember it because I don't know it's something about it.
1:17:37
Tomes Tomes Mahal, yeah.
Maji all, what the heck is that?
That's.
The that's the the I think that's the planet that you're on and I all is the continent.
It's got the same letters as Middle Earth.
Yeah, exactly.
It has, Yeah.
There, there's a there's a fun factoid history about this game, like changing, changing its branding at the last second to avoid cease and desist letters from the Tolkien estate.
1:18:01
But yeah, I think I think it's done better by branching out at its own thing, because I don't think Chrono Mancers really existed in In The Silmarillion.
But.
We don't know what the Blue Wizards did, so they could have been the Chrono Mancers.
There you go.
I'll start off, lead us.
1:18:17
So yeah, take it away, Sir.
I'm going to get this game a 7.5.
I think it was, whoa, pretty good.
I liked it.
I think it was like, I think it shows off a lot of the like where the appeal of a like a roguelike game can come from.
1:18:36
Like, I can see very, very much why roguelikes were popular like well before graphics got good.
Like you could have played and made most of this game a long time ago.
Like most of the stuff, like the graphics are not important to the gameplay.
1:18:53
You don't need to have like a strong computer to run it.
I think there's some like visual effects in there that like add a little bit but like the dungeon exploring bit the the moving around the the like complex systems interacting with each other and exploration and stuff it's all there and like I I had a pretty good time playing it.
1:19:12
I I mean I definitely have some criticisms on how some of the the user interfaces and some of the peripheral things work but like overall I I thought it was a a pretty fun game and yeah I think it I if if you're I think in this is if someone was asking me I want to play a traditional rogue like this is probably the one that I would recommend to them.
1:19:34
Now I think Cog Mind is a better game but this is a more intro friendly in terms of like you want to experience the genre and you want the fantasy aspect of it.
Like this really does have.
I mean, it has the star stuff and then if you want to get deeper into it, it's got all the weird stuff later in it too.
1:19:55
For sure.
For sure.
All right.
So I've given lots of disclaimers throughout this whole episode.
I'll give one last.
Final one, which is to say you know when you're when we're given these ratings, I mean the the how useful it is just comes down to, you know, on a player by player basis, if you are like me and you tend to like twitch your games, this review is applicable.
1:20:21
Originally I gave it like A5.
And then over the course of our conversation I realized, well 5:00, I mean 5 out of 10 makes you think, oh, this game's average.
It's definitely not average.
It's above average certainly and I think I can again understand why people like it.
1:20:37
All the stuff that Scott's describing.
Colin your experiences will your experiences, however troubled they were at times have in you know show illustrate to me that, hey, this game has a lot of depth and interest and previously I I said that I think it is an achievement and I stand by that statement, that assessment.
1:21:02
So yeah, 5.5, which unfortunately, you know puts it in like my bottom four of the games that I've reviewed with you fine folks.
But yeah, I'm glad that I played it.
Ultimately, I said that those six hours were not especially enjoyable, but I'm glad to have played tome.
1:21:22
It's better than the .1 that you gave.
Cataclys of Dark Days.
Well, the only reason I gave it up .1 was so like I could get it to like work in the ranking system and that was the quickest way to like well.
I want to make sure it's at the bottom .1.
Don't I'm I'm pretty tempted to go back and give it a similar rating, just at a spite at this.
Point and and that that raises.
1:21:38
That's pretty.
Bad and and that raises a great point.
Like here we have a game that for all its UI problems is is a lot better and does also have mouse.
And like it has, it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of Cataclysm while also having, I would argue, more interesting and more varied content.
1:21:58
Cool.
I guess I'm going to take it away here with with my review.
So as as everyone obviously knows, because I've said this so many times, 6 is my recommend threshold, right?
If it's a six or above, I'm going to go with the 6.5 here.
1:22:14
We did it.
Mission accomplished.
Boom.
Release the balloons.
I mean, like, this is to say, like, it's interesting, don't beat the game.
Like be exposed to it.
And I think it.
I think that's the best thing you do for yourself.
Expose yourself to it.
1:22:29
There are some weirdos out there who get really into this.
Like the person who wrote in I think you've read again.
But like, it's like, I can understand like how you know someone could get sucked in, but like, you should just tell are you that kind of person?
For me, no.
And and I just want to just reiterate, Rogue, like traditional Rogue likes, can not be fun.
1:22:50
They can't be fun.
It's not actually possible, and it can't.
Be compelling enough to make you play 60 hours.
Well, this was a.
Spiteful sort of nothing.
Like I said, I I've already given the reason for that and I I never intend to open this game again unless maybe the the airport or the air.
1:23:08
The you know, the flight situation might make more sense.
Maybe I played SIM five though or something like that.
But anyways, yeah, so it's 6.5.
If only it wasn't a rogue like that's It was doomed from the start.
But it it passed the threshold.
1:23:24
It did.
There's there's enough in there where you know, tested out.
All right.
I think I'm going to bring us home here with I I'm going to give this game a nine because yeah, I think this game I I didn't really like bounce off of at the beginning.
I just kind of was like there's, I don't know like what is here to grab me yet and I think that like the more I've kind of delved into it, the more I've been exposed to the very helpful Discord community that provides lots of good strategy insight.
1:23:55
The website itself reminds me a lot of like the Halo two era of like linking your account to the thing and you can see like all of your your stats and stuff on the main page and see where like your your character's like ranking is and all that stuff like it it.
The community for this game, despite the game being kind of long in the tooth, feels very live and very refreshing to engage with, which is which is a big plus.
1:24:21
I think we kind of talked about a lot of the things that our our anchor points to this, like EU like the UI not having an OK or an accept button a lot of the time is sort of baffling.
Being able to like, compare gear very easily, yeah, is something that more modern action RPGs do in a much more succinct fashion.
1:24:41
I think there's there's like a bottomless pit of mods that you can add on to quote fix those problems.
But should they need fixing, I think I have.
This is probably my best dollar to our engagement value for any of the Rogue Light games that I have where I've put like 40 ish hours into a game that I bought for 2 bucks.
1:24:59
But I think the quality here is much better than $2.00.
I think there's a lot of interesting variety, not just from the character classes, but basically from all the levels that aren't the starting ones.
Like the sand worm pit where you're gonna having to like chase sand worms as like the level is collapsing around you and make sure you don't get caught in like a bunch of sand and suffocate like cool idea.
1:25:21
These are things that if if like I see a lot of parallels between like Eldon Ring and Souls like games and this, but like this being much more in the Rogue sphere, where like, yeah, you're free to go and explore any, any zone that you want, but you're gonna get bludgeoned to death by a skeleton in one hit.
1:25:37
So good luck I think.
Yeah, like there's like picking up items automatically, not having to worry about food, not having to worry about grinding monsters, Things that you see in a lot of other traditional Rogue likes that are just a chore and a hate and like are antithetical to good game design.
1:25:56
I think this.
I think Dark God has done a very good job in circumventing those and getting right to the fun factor of just you go in, you blow stuff up with spells, you die.
Great, Try something new.
I think that that flow works very well.
So a nine for me, that's going to put it aggregate, despite my 9:00 at our new #18 game just behind Grifflands and just ahead of Streets of Rogue.
1:26:23
Out of the 40 games that we've talked about thus far And if you've made it this far in the episode, you're probably thinking, OK, what are some games that are like tome but different?
And I think there's there's two that jump out immediately.
I mentioned ancient Domains of mystery that has all the stuff that I don't like about traditional rogue, likes with food meters and using scrolls and spell management.
1:26:45
It's I've played that.
It's just, it's not for me.
Dungeon call stones.
But it could be for you.
Yes, it could be for you gentle listener.
So give it a look, see and see if it jibes with you.
If you thought tome had too advanced of graphics, there's always Dungeon Curl Stone Soup for you.
1:27:06
Where it is, there's no animations as far as I can tell.
It is very much.
You are just in a single ass dungeon.
You are crawling it.
There's probably some Stone soup around similar open source game wackiness, but it's very much more Andrew, like you were saying of like getting into that like almost shell scripting, terminal keyboard command of just like use a keyboard command for everything and you're just like on turbo mode the whole time.
1:27:34
Again I think these two aren't aren't games for us, for this podcast specifically for us four.
But I know a lot of people will probably be tuning in.
Oh, they're talking about tome, they're going to talk about dungeon crawl, right?
Probably.
But some games that I think are probably more our vibe, different graphical aesthetics, maybe a little bit more focused and coherent in their game design.
1:27:56
There's a game called Dungeon Man's which is much it's a similar vibe of Tome and maybe a little more constrained in its craziness, but it's it's got that kind of like Dungeons of Dread, more comedic effect going on open world, and every time that you die it's like, Congrats, you died and then you are levelling up your Dungeon Academy starting town as you go.
1:28:23
Recently released A Moon Ring has a very interesting visual aesthetic to it.
Free to play, developed by I think a guy who left bungee question mark, but that has gotten some really good reviews of like being kind of something that splits the difference between a rogue like and like an Ultima game, if that makes sense.
1:28:40
And yeah, I think that like in terms of solid modern UI development in a traditional rogue like Space Moon Ring is something that does it very well.
Open world Insanity game.
Ilona ELONA.
1:28:57
If you can think about it you can do it in that one, and I think a for sure.
Stay tuned and a half.
Possibly one point O ING this year is Caves of CUD, which I think is like the sci-fi equivalent of this.
But maybe when we get to it, the menu system will be a little less baffling than it actually is.
1:29:17
But give those games a look.
See, we talk a little bit about Cog Mine as more kind of like a focus single player experience.
But yeah, I think like we have some, we have some in the pipe coming up too that I think will test our hypothesis about what we liked and didn't like about this game coming down the road.
1:29:34
So stay tuned for some of those.
Yeah.
I think as we wind down here, if you want to write in with your thoughts about Home Vaults, you can send those emails into grogpodzone@gmail.com.
1:29:50
You can see all the tenant posting I've been doing about chronomancers at Grogpod at game dev dot place on Macedon.
And you can see our website that has all this nonsense on it with beta and our spreadsheets and all that exciting thing at grogpod dot zone.
1:30:08
Our next episode is a listener requested episode and I think they've thrown a a diplomatic bone to Colin and Will this time with the rogue like city builder against the storm.
Everyone is frantically googly.
1:30:24
Now what?
What is the?
I told you guys about it.
It doesn't talk.
Already on the Steam page?
This is this is oh.
Yeah, yeah, right, right.
Yeah, I've played.
I've played about 10 hours of this and I I this is a a sieve and factorial.
Players dream for roguiness.
1:30:43
I almost bought it and then I was like, well, we're just going to be playing this eventually on the podcast, so I'll wait until we do it.
Yeah.
So the listeners.
Yeah, thanks for thanks for suggesting this to us again.
If you want to request a show for us to to talk about, send us an e-mail grogpodzone@gmail.com or just, you know, put it, put it down below where like you're listening to this down below means anywhere.
1:31:05
Just tell us what game you want us to play and then then we'll get to it eventually.
But yeah, our episode upcoming, I I think will probably already has 300 hours in it since I just said against the storm.
But but yeah, that's going to, that's going to put the curtains on tone here and, well, I guess.
1:31:28
Say goodbye.
It is tone to say goodbye.
And what better way to say goodbye than having the curtain of this episode, of this Gray rain curtain of this world rolling back on this podcast episode And all of the audio that you've listening to has turned to silver glass.
1:31:47
And then you see it, Colin.
See.
See what?
Gandalf.
What?
Do you say Gandalf?
You see White Shores and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise, for the next podcast episode, the.
1:32:29
The.
1:33:19
The.
The.
1:33:37
