[Music] hello everyone thank you for tuning in to another episode of the going rogue gaming podcast a podcast about roguelike games and roguelike adjacent uh ideas and themes today we're talking about a an another had to be hitter in our library we have a classic FTL faster than light developed and published I thought it was Fruit of the Loom I wore my Fruit of the Loom underwear no no that's the that's the Fruit of the Loom podcast it's there also get get used to this because I interrupt a lot so that's that's kind of my uh that's kind of my deal Scott knows this yes and uh you were telling us about this game before I immediately uh off tracked Us by talking about underwear yes exactly um well yes well hello welcome to the FDL episode uh I am your Federation Starship Captain Scott Berger and I'm joined with my Rogues gallery of uh podcast co-host I'm a mantis teleported upon your ship Colin

uh I'm will just straight up will boring will here um yeah oh do you want to introduce me Scott I don't know we have our first guest episode yay uh we're joined by our very special friend of Woody saskowski uh who I have I have terrorized his podcast long enough I thought he was a good time for him to return the favor for this episode sure except usually when you're on our podcast you like you struggle to get in a word edgewise and so now I'm gonna just take over I'm just gonna commandeer your podcast I'm going to beam in on my teleporter and Slaughter your crew and and collect your scrap oh that's the first trap I'm all mantis cruise I am going to eat you alive when you teleport in oh no and then I'll take your [ __ ] for scrap I'm I'm excited to feel the love feel the love here on the FTL podcast yes that's what it stands for right feel the love fire fire the lasers we're gonna come up with a lot of uh other other acronyms for what it could possibly stand for it was slow it was a slow day at work so I was I was taking notes I was making good use of your public funds uh-huh excellent um yeah so so this is an oldie but a goodie this is a 2012 uh roguelike game that you can find in Windows Mac ironically enough as like a browser game which I thought was interesting I mean that doesn't surprise me that's true yeah it is it is a pretty lightweight um I wouldn't really call it simple but you know uh low complexity enough game that you could run in a browser and iOS it's a game that can be controlled exclusively via Mouse that's not the ideal way to control it but like every functionality you need can be accessed via clicking yes I I do actually did any of you guys I imagine that none of you guys played it on iOS no but uh how close does a steam deck come to an iOS I tried to plan on my steam deck and it does not work very well the screen is just too small like the level of precision to like click on a door to open or close it it is not very good um and like the putting a screen protector on a steam deck makes the touchpad not very accurate um so I don't know it's fine I don't usually play my steam Deck with like the touchpad format but I kind of could see it being a pretty fun way to play it on iOS especially if it's configured for iOS yeah and the screen is a little bit bigger so you don't have to have quite the same level of touch Precision well yeah and it's like it's an iOS Port of the game it's not just like a steam deck where you're playing the PC version on a way smaller screen it's not fully optimized for that yeah yeah there were numerous times where I was like frantically trying to click a door click click the door click the door it stopped the fire from spreading and then just like it you know it takes like five or six floats but I'm actually I was I was kind of surprised at how well it played on there but um but anyway FTL faster than light welcome uh this is a one of the most popular games in the roguelike category coming in at a hot number 19 with 42 000 total reviews unsurprisingly the 99th percentile um Woody as our guest of honor for this week uh what would you say is a one sentence description of what someone does in FTL um it's okay it's a Captain Kirk simulator

it's a space combat game where instead of like being the pilot or the Gunner which is what you usually are in space combat games you are just the person who tells people what to do you just shout orders from the bridge

yeah this game starts people out on Transporters yeah this game does feel very unique compared to a everything else around that was being released at the time but even games nowadays like you don't really see a game like this these days where you're controlling multiple people running around specifically like a ship and having to you know deal with the dangers and deadly encounters with other ships uh is it fair to call this a real-time strategy game no absolutely not a near real-time strategy game I mean it like is rimworld a real time straight I mean like any game where you can just pause it I don't think you guys call that a real-time strategy I mean the real problem is that real-time strategy game is just a terrible name for that genre of game like Starcraft is a real-time tactics game and everything else is like strategy involves larger things going on uh but I don't know I feel I feel like you need to have a larger like economy you're not you're not building an engine in FTL the engine comes on your ship and you're buying it eventually but I mean I I I kind of I think that it's fit I would I would take the other side I think it's fair to call the combat in this game real-time strategy like I I agree with will it's a little weird with your ability to pause it at will but since it's only a one-player game like that still works because you are essentially like part of a real-time strategy game is adapting on the fly to what your opponent is doing and that's basically what the combat in FTL is all about because you'll never have enough resources to do everything and so you kind of have to divert one resource like if you're I mean has missiles you're like all right I gotta put more into the engines to Dodge I think that the structure around that combat honestly reminds me more of like a uh a board game I feel like that's sort of um the more I I was reading uh the heavily sourced um and I'm sure very accurate Wikipedia page for this game and um the designers listed inspiration as the Battle Star Galactica board game uh which is very much like built upon these you know I mean traced all the way back to like dungeon the dragons where it's like you encounter this kind of enemy you encounter this kind of event make a skill check based on you know either some equipment you have or someone in your crew and encounter some random circumstance and it's just like you're just kind of going from encounter to encounter like that which is very much sort of a board game format but then the combat is very much its own unique thing which does make up the majority of the game yeah I I know that like rimworld came after and it is a pretty different kind of game but the combat and FTL to me feels like a more condensed version of something like that where you have a very small number of permanent uh pawns to move around uh and like losing even one of them is a devastating blow I think that's the biggest difference for me between something like rimworld or FTL and an RTS and RTS like you lose a Marine in Starcraft and you're like good he got that circling though yeah I guess you're like no they killed this I use my only pilot [ __ ] I forgot how hard this game was because I haven't played this game in a long time I reinstalled it on Steam on my new computer and I have 80 hours in this game which is a lot of time um but like I still remember totally how to play it but I'm like God I can't believe I put 80 hours in this game and I looked at my stats I'd beaten this game in 80 hours I think five times like three three uneasy and two on normal and I looked up like the steam weirdly like my steam achievements had not synced so when like I I think they might have added achievements later after I had already put 80 hours into the game and so when I reinstalled it and booted it on my computer I got like 30 achievements at the same time so if you look at my steam history it's like wow at 4 34 PM like what do you accomplished all this stuff in FTL it was a very efficient uh one minute gaming session totally legit totally legit but like yeah go ahead all right so I'm curious you said that 80 uh 80 hours and uh and what where where did the rest of you guys land for this game for me like I had I think I bought this game ages and ages ago because it was like this was probably one of my my first ever roguelike games that I bought on Steam like way way way back when everyone's like oh yeah super good you gotta try it and then like it was so so different than anything else that I played at the time that I I like kind of poked around I got like annihilated after like two seconds like yeah I'll come back to this later and then you know played something else for a little bit but for for the show here I was like okay it's it's on the list we're gonna dust it off and I put more time into it and also coming to this after playing a lot of um into the breach the other game that uh subset games had had developed yes um like that helped to really kind of gel the the combat mechanics like like balancing out Energy Systems and and like powering up weapons and abilities and things like that it made a lot more sense this time around so this time around I think I I've only beaten I've only beaten it on easy twice after 40 hours okay uh each time feeling like an absolute like Herculean like effort where I'm just like sweaty and exhausted and just like on the floor and about to pass out yeah well I mean like this game is long like one playthrough of this I usually think of most of the roguelikes I play like a Spelunky or the enter the gungeon is like you can make a run in probably if you're going leisurely like 40 minutes max um whereas here like you could probably spend an hour and a half at least to make it through and like I always have trouble in roguelikes um stopping mid play because it's like you lose track of kind of the build that you were going for for yourself you get out of that flow and then you're just like you come back and I feel like if you ever pause you come back and dive so fast oh no I forgot that I need to have it in this exact Arrangement and like this game is so kind of unforgiving it's like yeah you were saying call like you lose one crew member and you're like [ __ ] like I I was I was playing the ship or last night staying up late and like just annihilating people with my halberg beam like killing I had like this thing that charges up your weapons like between encounters so I would start with my weapons fully charged and I would just blast their shield and then destroy them with like one beam shot and I'm like oh this is way overpowered and weapon-free weapons free igniter oh my God you know it's like that's an automatic win right well that's how I was feeling and then like I accidentally moved one of my zolt on guys who like gives energy to the spot out of the web I'm like oh I gotta go repair that other room so I moved him out of the weapons Bay and then my beam turned off and then I just got like blasted by the Rebel Ship and like well I'm like well now I'm [ __ ] and it's really hard to sort of once you make one mistake in this game to kind of right the ship and so it's this brutal combination of this hour and a half play through that requires you to sort of be focused and make good decisions the entire way through um and yeah I was what one was like I was looking at my achievements and you know how steam shows the Rarity of um an achievement like beat the game on normal that's like an eight percent achievement which is crazy because I just beat like Elden ring a month ago and like the like famously hard game Elden ring and like the achievement of like beat Elden ring is like 30 and I have no idea how steam calculates those achievements if it's based on like how many people have bought the game versus unlock it or if it's based on a certain amount of play time but it's just pretty wild to me that the goal of this game to beat it on normal is a less than 10 completion rate and what's crazy is that uh yeah so like easy super low normal even lower like I was trying to figure out like has anyone beaten this game on hard according to steamage there's no Stephen there's no steam engine which I don't don't know if that's like just trying to to do the players a favor of just like that that is that is very merciful of them will did you beat it on heart uh no I'd be doing normal and like that I put 62 hours into the game and I was very surprised at like 20 hours in is when I got my first win with like the very first starter thing I kind of had this mindset if I wanted to like play the first ship until I beat it on normal play in a second but then I realized you just gotta find whatever the best ship is and really go with that but even so like I didn't beat it to get on normal after that and I refused to go down to easy and so uh oh you're definitely yeah uh speaking of uh we were talking about how much it hurts to lose crew and I was like I'm pretty sure I got that one achievement and I was looking through it's like yeah trustworthy autopilot uh is defeat an enemy ship with all of your crew aboard it

and I had like four guys on their ship my entire crew on their ship teleporting across and like one of my lasers went off and I forgot to stop it and it killed the ship and I was like well there's my run it was a really good run too and I just like I killed all my people on accident and what's great is when the actually you're all over there and then they're powering up their drive and you can't stop it and then they beam off and then you almost like that oh that was so good yeah um Scott I I don't know how much um when you do this show you actually get into like the fundamental gameplay of how this game works yeah I think like your your call out about like Battlestar Galactica or um like Starship Captain battle is the super app so like the so we've talked a lot about like our experiences with the game but the game itself like if you have never heard of FTL before uh you start off by by picking a ship you come to your your well like let's take a step back your call to action your story here is that you are part of the Galactic Federation you have some plans that are crucial to the survival that said Federation and you the lowly messenger ship has to run across all these uh warp jump points through space to get to the Federation headquarters it's kind of a reversal of tropes because like since Star Wars it's always like oh the rebels are the good guys the rebels like have to defeat this Galactic Empire and it's like nope you are the Galactic Empire and when you get to that rebel ship at the end you're like [ __ ] these Rebels are well equipped because they got a hell of a battleship going on uh-huh I like that I like that they were Rebels like in that you were the Empire because I it is such an old cliche it would always be on the rebel team they say Federation and I've been watching a lot of Deep Space Nine recently so I was like okay yeah like like I could see this being like a Star Trek Federation of good guys versus like a galactic there's like there's little tidbits sprinkled around of like you know the the Federation of you know that controls the Galaxy is kind of like you know losing power and waning and the rebels are trying to take it over and that kind of stuff but it's very it's very Loosely kind of sprinkled here and there but it's basically you know you start in a hangar where you're picking different different ships and how many ships do you start with for options in this game like I I I one one they can't say something this is this is something that is um in through the into the breach as well um which is something that I think subset sub Stack Games is that what subset subset that's something they do really really well like um I'll let you get back to your point you know sort of the walkthrough of this Scott but like what I think is so great about this game is like this game could so easily fall into the cat category that I associate with you Scott of um games for nerds something like Cog mind where it's like um stay tuned it's like deliberately designed to kind of have this super obfuscated interface where you're like I don't know what to do there's too much sort of information and numbers and like different kind of systems that I have to parse out and here they give you like the simplest ship right at the start and it's not worse like I think in some ways the simpler the ship is in this game probably the better you're gonna do with it um but they're like all right just start with this and they gradually as you play and unlock new achievements you unlock new ships which totally change the way the game is played yeah um and yeah into the breach does that as well because you're constantly unlocking new Mech squads and I think it does a really good job of um giving you something to accomplish even if you don't have this game has no what what is it called in Rogue games where there's like

yeah exactly like in Rogue Legacy where you like constantly can level up sort of the intrinsic abilities of whatever character you're playing as like this game has none of that like you don't unlock like anything for future playthroughs but you just unlock more choices and ships to play as yeah and I think unlocking new characters they're not better characters they're some of the leader ships are much more like focused yes so like if you're like I really like the Mantis which are like the I don't know bug creature attack I mean they're they're mantis they really are just really enjoyed I don't know if they're better I think they're probably not better in a lot of cases but I really enjoyed the gameplay of beaming board people's ships and their ship is optimized for that uh you can absolutely do that same strategy on other ships you just have to build in a little bit to get there well that's the thing that to me is so fantastic about this game is I think with very few exceptions there's not anything that's better like I think that this game succeeds because no matter what you build your ship to be there's going to be other ships that counter it that you're going to be weaker against and no matter what ships you encounter you there'll be some way that you can encounter you can beat that [ __ ] like if you have a man to ship you know like all right I'm gonna be very good at teleporting but like I might be weak like defensively so I need to get some a drone to shoot down missiles or something like that right you have to get that thing that lets you bypass the shields because if you come up that's a one ship yeah so you can't teleport onto you're just like well I have no weapons so exactly and like this game is really cool in the sense that like there's a lot of situations and this is something that I think I really struggle with that is really on me where I just when I get into a fight with another ship I want to destroy that ship I'm like I'm not running away like I'm blowing up the ship and getting it scrapped whereas there's a lot of situations where you look at another ship's weapon Loadout and you're like [ __ ] I should not be fighting the ship because it is going to decimate me because it has a bunch of beam weapons and my Shields suck and what you have to do then is just like pump everything into your engine and Shields and like get out of there because this game is so much like encourages practical thinking like it can be so easy in games to get like kind of bogged down in either like a morality system or like Petty revenge against like the this other ship that's [ __ ] you up but here you're just like all right like it's much better for me to not take six damage here because the reward I get is not going to be worth it and it has a pretty it has a pretty strong death spiral if you start getting some critical systems damaged your whole is damaged too much everything's on fire and your doors can't stop it from spreading yeah it's it's not it's not meant to like so many other games non-roguelike games mostly they're like give you those safety nets so that if your ship gets messed up or your build is not good they'll figure out a way to like bring you back to that winning path versus FTL is just like well if you if your ship gets hurt and now your guy dies it's like well you just are probably gonna lose and it's how fast you want to admit that yeah that eight percent normal win rate kind of speaks a lot to that I think it's just like the game the game is really really wants you to lose and they give you a lot of opportunities to do it well I think it stands for fantastic time losing I I know that there were when I was like trying to grind out uh certain ships or just victories in general I would just restart after that first sector if it was if it didn't go well yeah that's that's what I said I I don't I could absolutely get to sector seven with this ship and die there and I don't want to waste my time because I've already played it a lot and I want to I want to give myself the best chance of success and I you know I once you played enough times you're like this isn't a very good ship I got hit a lot I spent a lot of money like repairing your ship which is a complete waste of money I encountered a bunch of stations where they're like hey come buy Gap fuel from us when you didn't have any money and they were like oh I just wasted all of these jumps yeah yeah there's lots of this this game I think has a lot of interesting uh decisions to make along your run where the first few times that you play it so I'll I'll give this game a pat on the back for its tutorial uh any game that has like a good good but not too overbearing tutorial to kind of just like get your feet wet and then get you out the door and get you going is good and I think that's the place to start here just so you understand like okay this is how I use weapons to like hurt enemy ships and what are the effects of that and all that but as you are trying to so I think there's what like eight um eight uh worlds quote-unquote sectors that you're effectively jumping through where each one of these sectors has I think this is the first time that we see this in um the the roguelikes that have come out up to this point is this like Choose Your Own Adventure path so you're starting and like there's a bunch of these different branching paths and now everyone has it like it's the principal component of slate Aspire you see it in the description and everything oh yeah you're right um where you you have to choose like okay I'm from here I have to go to this other node and you can kind of see like oh this node connects to like five other nodes and will that like tell me if a enemy ship is nearby if there's a store nearby I'm running low on fuel but I need to go and fight a ship so I can collect scrap which is your money in this and then I can upgrade systems or weapons like what what do I need to do and I feel like this is a game that um as you're progressing through this run this is this is a roguelike where you can't really um go in a run with a mindset of like okay this is the build that I'm gonna do you have to wait for the build to happen to you

yeah there's not there are meaningful choices but they're not super they don't happen super often they don't happen often enough that you can make a choice not to make a choice like you need to you need to make that choice quickly because it's you're like okay am I gonna do missiles or not and if you make the not Choice enough times you just have nothing and that is an easy thing to to do but as you're going through and you're like okay I have like this really good ship with like a lot of like beam weapons or something on it and you're like yeah I definitely actually need all these missiles like there are encounters where you can say like oh like yeah I'd love to sell off these missiles for more fuel or for you know more currency or something like that and then using that to like build back into your workflow of okay now I have more money to do to do uh like get this really crucial uh system that I mean if you if you've played the final boss enough times you're like okay I absolutely need this if my goal is to win this game this time that's one thing that I I mean in in my more recent playthroughs of this um I didn't even get to the final boss because just getting to the final boss is quite a feed-in of itself and that's something that I remember being a little cranky with I feel like the final boss of this game can be so hard and has some sort of like just outrageous abilities to um counter what you're doing that you kind of have to adapt a couple borderline cheesy strategies to be able to fight him like I do sometimes feel like I can only get through this game by sort of like spamming cloak or something like that it's like my biggest criticism with with the game and with the final boss itself is that the fight feels different than the rest of the game that's a good that's a good phrase four Shields is pretty insane that's that's a game changer I think from my point of view because everything else up to that you you're it's much more manageable yeah like I have more than once got to the last boss and not done a single point of damage to it because I just don't have the like damage per second equivalent I just can't burst my way through and it's not that my [ __ ] can't put out a lot of damage it's like oh this puts out a lot of damage over a long period of time but you need that like all of your damage happens at exactly one time so you can burst your way down through the Shields and then hit their Shields and then Cascade them down there's a few there's a few strategies against the final boss that just straight up don't work and I feel like that's kind of a bummer and it's strategies that are sometimes can be extremely effective for the previous seven years like all beam weapons if you can just get through their Shield real quick but like in this case it's just like well you just can't and so you cannot effectively do damage boarding I think I think boarding was pretty much as far as I could tell like the really the only way or just have so many missiles in a banked up missiles that you can take out their Shields completely but other than those two I don't know what you could possibly do um and that's why I mean drones I guess but drones are just kind of like a that was that was how I beat the game the first time and I think like my my first Victory like I feel like like winning in this game is something that you print out and frame and put on your wall of like oh my God I did it like I can't believe it and I was using the the NG ship which is just like a donut um and so I think that was the first ship I won with also yeah and like for context for listeners like most of the ships that you find in this game are like roughly the same size as your ship maybe smaller sometimes um and in my in my first Victory Run I was going through and I had this um chance encounter in one of like the the rebel uh Homeworld uh sectors where you go through and there's an event that you can come by of like oh my God you stumble upon the the uh Rebel Flagship as the final boss uh you stumble upon it in like a half completed State and you you get like this preview fight of like you know it's it doesn't have all of its guns ready it doesn't have all of its like super like crazy special weapons at the end of the game but it gives you a good taste test of like what's to come and I was like okay like I was I like scraped mine was able to beat uh beat him at that time I was just like spamming drones the whole time like okay this is this is what I'm up against for the final boss this is something that my the weaknesses in my ship have been kind of exposed I should go and fix X Y and Z to prep for it um and when it came time the the last sector that you get to like has this really ominous tone of like you know the rebel Fleet is like they have closed in like the Federation is on his last legs and the rebel Flagship is back for Revenge um and you see it when you bring up a little map of like it's going from here to here like normally you never see any of the ship's movements but like here you can see like it's coming right for you and I was able to set up camp like okay all of my stuff is ready to go Rebel Flagship comes in like okay I got you this time I was prepped from that one one encounter and like it was a tough fight and then I'm like okay hooray I finally beat the boss and then it warps away I'm like wait what oh right yeah you have to read it twice it's a final form three times three times yeah yeah it turns into a Boss Rush mode I haven't played in a while I played my 60 six hours and then I haven't played it in like two years so I guess

sorry uh I guess fortunately like each time that like you beat you beat you quote unquote Beat the Boss the first time and like chunks of it get like torn off so like the second and third times like they're it's not back at like full health per se but the strategy the strategy changed every time like that's that's sort of the gimmick is it's like your ship has to be able to like deal with all types of attacks because it's like first it just sort of barrages you with missiles and then they like yeah and cloak and then they like send people on to your ship to fight fight you and you have to be able to repel borders and so it really does mean that like you can't this isn't really a game where you can have like a focused build you can sort of come up with one mostly op Strat to sort of guide you through but you still need to be able to handle all of whatever else it would throw on you just just enough this is a game you can't have a dump stat yeah exactly and then you can be well-rounded and then have one like really good thing that you can do well and that seems to be like the trend like between this and into the breach I feel like have a lot of very similar design philosophies where it feels like they're big and I mean this is this is really high praise because I think this is the ideal like this is ideal game design is like everything you just kind of feel like you just squeak by like you feel like you just barely have enough to kind of get what you need and make resources and so you're everything in this game is like a very slightly tricky decision it's like how much do I want to repair the whole for a suspense some of that for fuel so I don't get stuck can I scrape by with four whole points until I get that weapon and then repair right because like all for for how many combat fights you get in here like even the combat in this game is very satisfying but like if it's too easy it can get fairly boring um and so I think that this game does a really incredible job of always feeling like you're cutting things close another thing that I really like about um the design of this and again I feel like it's also true to end of the breach and Scott referenced slave Aspire I think this is a thing that has become more common in game design and FTL isn't even the best example of it but it's like the game gives you a lot of like not perfect information but it gives you like a very reasonable amount of information and like oh I'm not disagree with you completely on that okay depending on how high level your sensors are I guess right right well because like you can see for example you can see what um enemy ships like have equipped on their ship before the fight even starts you can see like all of their systems down there and you can decide all right is this a fight I think I want to win or is this one I need to like just get ready to run away from um and like into the breach or slay the Spire is very much like taking that to like the nth degree because it's like this is what the enemy is gonna do on its next turn um and like how do you want to respond for that and I think that's great um and if you get enough powered up sensors in FTL like it'll tell you where their power is going and like you can visually see weapons like lasers charging up on their ship um I I think it is a good balance like obviously this game is still built upon a lot of sort of RNG which can be frustrating um but I do feel like each time you encounter RNG you are learning something and you're like all right how how now that I'm aware of what the consequence of the bad action is there like how will I deal with that if it happens to me again well so here's the thing about all this is that like and I and I think that like slay Aspire is the perfect sort of like Counterpoint to all this in that like in slit Inspire it's like well you know what cards are in your draw pile and like even though you don't know which cards you're going to draw you have some sense about what's coming up in some sense of probabilities yeah when you're making decisions in the game and so far we've only been really talking about the combat there every single note is in events and the event might be combat I think it's combat like maybe 50 of the time but otherwise it's just like a text based Adventure essentially right and they give you some dialogue and they say hey like you've come across a ship and they're being attacked by spiders do you want to send a crew over there to help them and I'll tell you what I'm sure everyone here is sent to crew and they're like [ __ ] I just lost the crew and that was like my only person doing this role that's because giant alien spiders are no jokes

right but the point the point here is that you don't know what the outcome is and you don't even know the probability of a good outcome right if I just knew oh if you take this chance you're gonna actually use a 50 chance of gaining or losing agreement I'd be like oh now I have that's a good to know do you play the fire they do that that would be that's actually an interesting Insight like do you think the game would be more or less fun if it just gave you in parentheses like what like your risk versus reward of the decision and that's exactly what they do insulated inspires like right there's a 50 chance of getting a curse right good I'm glad that you told me that and actually for the entire playthrough after I realized this exists I had the script like loaded up on a page and I always just type in the beginning of the prompt and be like okay now I know there's a one-third chance of this then the other and that like made the game way more fun for me because otherwise it's just frustrating that will does it like that more otherwise you're taking a Bayesian approach you're just going into every encounter me like okay I've encountered this event one time and of the hundreds of events you might not encounter again and this is my one outcome and so you don't really know like how what is are there three outcomes are there five it's just frustrating and stupid and I think when games have learned from this yeah I think that that's fair there was one time I was uh in the in the Rock home world so what one thing I I love about this game is like all the alien races are like super weird like any game that has like really strange and different like alien designs I'm a big fan of um so we've we've talked about the mantas they're they're Rock guys who are super slow and beefy and who are like basically immune to fire uh there are uh NG guys I think are just like made out of Nano nanoparticles question mark um they're parafast that's all I know yeah they repair fast they you know you have your multi-purpose humans are kind of good at everything uh there's there's um the game I think only comes in the advanced Edition nowadays but yeah there's like a you know a button that you can toggle it's like you know Advanced Edition extra stuff and there's some more alien races in there that like suck up oxygen out of the room that they're in which is kind of cool that you can like you can use them as like a boarding crew to like get in and like suck oxygen out and fight they're hard they're hard to get a crew full of them but if you can then you're just like I win you can't board meeting yeah but to this point like I was I was in the Rock home world and I was coming across an event that was like very clearly like you know oh like this you know super ship is taunting you and it's flying off to this other direction you should go and Chase it you know like there's some event happening like okay I'm gonna go chase him like something's up here um and I was you know fighting him and the the uh this was the event for unlocking the rock ship so there are there are many events in this game that you can encounter like the uh the Mantis ship uh you can encounter like a Crystal Ship or like the Zoltan Cruiser um and if you complete those events in a certain way then you can unlock them otherwise if you just defeat the final boss using you know whatever ship is in the little progression system that you see in the hangar that'll automatically unlock the next one which is I think a fine method of doing so yeah I was in the Rock home world like chasing this uh this you know super Rock Cruiser and it was coming down to what I thought was like the final battle I'm like okay I'm gonna blow this thing up and unlock it and like I will have you know unlock like one of the last ships that I can get which was the wrong move what you're supposed to do is like fight this ship Cruiser like close to this star but just like continuously keep fighting him the game never tells you that it's yeah like you know hey like here's an event happening and like I I blew him up I was like Yay wait no like I didn't actually want to kill him I do feel like that is an occasionally unhealthy Trend that we see in in games is um the games that seem designed for you to play with the wiki open that always bugs me and like games like you know the souls born games like people kind of use it yeah exactly part of like oh that's just part of the design you just have that open and I'm like I want all that information in game and so yeah I I agree that like I think that the events that they have for unlocking things are cool and creative and interesting but like I think that they need to give you more information on what that is yeah I feel like

there's definitely I I feel I have two two sides on this um one is this is a Star Trek simulator and I you don't know what you know if you're going into that room full of spiders like you don't know what's gonna happen like knowing exactly the outcomes knowing exactly what the possibilities are takes away from that part of the game um which it would be but the problem is really it's two games in one there's the the Star Trek running around simulator and there's the like deep crunchy uh roguelike game that requires some fairly intense optimization to to beat it if it were not such a hard game they're easier to win then it would feel so bad to not know these outcomes because basically it's like oh you lose this crew member it's like well then you start over because you know you're you're in the second sector and you only have you've lost 25 of your crew and uh you know you might as well you you probably aren't going to finish the run so I I think that like this game just kind of runs contrary to a lot of like common game like when you usually play games and you're like there's a mining Colony being attacked by giant spiders do you want to rescue them at least for me like I naturally assume like yeah I'm the hero I'm gonna send someone and go rescue them or like win an enemy asks for Mercy like a slave trader asks for Mercy I'm gonna be like no [ __ ] you like [ __ ] you slave Traders but like here there's a lot of situations where you just have to be like no I'm just gonna leave all these pieces people to die to enemy spiders because it's far more it's far worse for me to lose a crew member here then to potentially gain scrap and like that trade-off is not always going to be the case because you might have like a whole bunch of crew members um but and then at the same time like yeah this game really does ask you to like abandon Morality In a lot of situations because there's no like end game like reward of like hey you rescued everyone who was in trouble so like here's a bunch of bonus scrap or a different ending like this game does not care whether or not like you it's gonna be the boss yeah and whether or not you bought bought stuff from the slavers or took bribes from Pirates it's just like whatever is going to benefit my build at the moment what do I need now right I gotta like I want to address like Collins point about it being like somewhat of a Star Trek simulator and for these decisions in particular because if we're gonna try and say it's like Star Trek what's gonna happen is that he's gonna get you know someone's gonna come on screen say that there's spider is down below do you want to help out he's going to turn to data he's going to turn to Detroit and he's gonna get more information he's going to say hey data what's the likelihood of us succeeding here and he's gonna is it gonna be like so it the one line of text is

yeah exactly the situation but also like as a Star Trek simulator like with that you even if they Zeta says they have a low chance of success they're still going to go do it yeah yeah I mean they are the hero and like here I mean in some ways this is kind of like the thing same thing I struggle with in poker like with poker there's a lot of situations where it's you just have to choose not to play even though it always feels more fun to like take the risk and be like what's gonna happen I want to go in on this hand I want to see if I could beat the ship here you just have to sort of take a breath and be like I'm not ready to fight this ship it is not going to benefit me to destroy it and I am just going to pump energy into uh my engines and you know Escape as soon as I can or you do the the opposite part of Poker which is objectively this was the right decision and you lost anyway yeah like yeah I had pocket aces but the other guy had pocket kings and it was a full house for him so there you go it's like you can't and Grudge yourself that too much sometimes you just get screwed and I mean that's probably true for the philosophy of like roguelikes in general is yeah it you know like I said I put 80 hours in this game I beat it like once seemingly once every 10 hours is about the about the rate um but I still like I still love this game and I have a great time playing it whether I die against the Federation ship or the Rebel Ship or whether I die in the second sector like it's still like interesting things happen and the way all of the systems interact especially with the advanced Edition which um yeah like Scott said is sort of inevitable now like if you're playing this game in 2022 you're playing the advanced Edition but ads like hacking and mind control and there's just a lot of very cool ways that the systems interact I will say the the advanced Edition stuff is is good and caught me completely off card for the boss fight where I had this super like totally overpowered uh Sultan Cruiser that was going through and just shredding all the enemies that I came across and then like we kind of talked about with the difficulty Spike at the end the final boss just so so far and above the the level that my ship was at in terms of like what my build was set to accomplish that I had to get out like a pen and paper and write down like the timings for all the weapons to like make sure they they happened just at the right time because the the uh Rebel Flagship with the enhanced content will have uh will have hacking we'll have mind control subsystems and that little hacking drone that flies off in a like latches onto the outside of your ship all of a sudden you can't shoot your weapons like 30 of the time I was reading tips and they said that if the flagship hacks into your weapons just fly away and then come fight it again and hope that it hacks into a different system oh yeah it feels so weird the the idea that you can run away from the final boss is like I mean I'm sure that that button is up at the top of the screen but like my eyes would never no because you're not that's just not how video game you're like this is the end of the game where would I run to like right but yeah it's like oh well yeah but you got you rolled bad RNG there and you come back and and get better next time so it's very strange so I do I do want to make one call out that uh there is there's like a Mega Mod for FTL called FTL Multiverse which I think I've I've talked with Colin and will about what have you heard about this at all no I I don't mess around with mods all that much yeah this for for Will's context uh I was playing around with this a little bit earlier today I think this is probably well maybe not quite like the slave Aspire downfall equivalent but effectively like this is a it's a fan made mod that is basically just ftl2 that all the stuff that you know if you're a big FTL head this is just like so much more good stuff that like new backgrounds like new interactions new weapons new like crazy new alien races all that good stuff and it you know ties directly into into uh your game so you need to have the game in order to You Know download and play this but in just like the 20 minutes so that is the definition of a mod right yeah like but I mean a certain point you start getting to be like the mod is as big as the game and feels like it could be played on its own I think the downfall you could play separately completely separately from oh Wild uh it's a different yeah it's a different icon it's a different uh I don't know maybe maybe I'm wrong there I don't know but uh but yeah I'm wondering like how much of the stuff that we've we've kind of talked about because I I don't think subset games are going to come back and make an FTL too I don't think I don't think they need to I think this this game already is pretty it's a pretty complete package for for its flaws that I think have aged pretty well like for this being gosh like an 11 year old game up thereabouts like it's aged pretty well I think yeah no I had a great time coming back and playing it's got the same if the graphics and the music are oh the music is really good the music's good the graphics are simple and effective they don't really if in this style that's also ageless the the like little scenarios that you get into are you know generically sci-fi things but they're they're interesting and well written for the most part um there's not enough controls for the controls to have gotten bad over time as we get used to better things so and really like Scott like you said like this is the B this is the Inception of that kind of Overworld node-based strategy and I think that that's I mean if that's the case that's that's really I think the biggest Innovation that this game has had but maybe that's just that's just my impression it's probably the thing that is most influential on other like no one else seems to have tried to make a game that much like FGL but everyone hasn't has taken that like no branching and then coming back together kind of style now choose your own answer now yeah I mean yeah I think that this game is the rare I mean that sweet combination of a game that is very influential um in a lot of design choices but like is still even though this game's 11 years old like I would wholeheartedly recommend going and playing this game because it's not like I don't think that the better version of FTL has come out in 11 years it could come out today and be a successful game yes and like be like yeah this is a great game you should play it not for nostalgia's sake just because it's a good game yeah yeah old name drop FTL Multiverse once more uh just because I know that there's like any time that I'm like driving and I listen to a podcast and I hear someone say like the name of a thing and like I'll forget it like 10 seconds later and they'll be like what was that thing and then like well after like yeah is it available in Steam um you have to get it separately it's uh where is it yeah you just have to like it's it's on the subset games Forum okay on there but like it's it's official enough that like yeah you just you download some stuff and run it but um I will say like uh for how you know technically minded everyone here on on the podcast is like I was getting some mental fatigue just trying to like download and like get all these zip and like I had to like download a new version of java and stuff but there's um one link on that page that's kind of hidden which kind of bums me out but it's like a direct uh Google or yeah like a Google Drive Link that's just like a straight up executable you download that you just double click on it it's so bad it it feels why can't it be in Steam like everything that I've learned has said don't just open random executions in a Google Drive all of a sudden that hacking module is going to get embedded in your computer Scott's a Multiverse mod this is just how he's getting he's getting your uh you know he's gonna run his roguelike simulators on your computer I gotta power up the Mind Control uh uh part first but uh yeah like hijack your computer to do data scraping yeah

the stay tuned list for sure uh I feel like I'm I'm on the fence about having like a a six-month Lookout Blackout Window of like not of like making sure to like give games like six months to like mature and stabilize before making them a candidate to cover on the show but I don't know it's it's tempting it's real time we have to play to our Fortress fine but then we have to do the thing that no one that I know has ever done she's actually played the weird Adventure Mode that is well Scott loves the adventure mode wait did you play it yeah we covered it on on the ultra 64 podcast for an episode I I somehow tricked them into well you tricked us by giving us money to make it clear a powerful motivator yeah well okay I I mean I guess I stand immediately and strongly corrected 50 of the people that I'm looking at on the screen right now have played it I played it too actually great great everyone I know has played it but not me uh but that isn't it like that's a roguelike also I must directly roguelike Forum so we could play that that would be fun I'm sorry that I derailed the conversation to talk about a game I don't like instead of a game that I actually very much don't like okay see the war Fortress is very much my example of a game for nerds and that's where I think that that's what I like about FTL so much is it scratches that itch of feeling like you're a smart numbers guy but in reality you're just clicking little boxes and redirecting power in a way that's very intuitive fair enough I think I think the new steam version new IDE like that that really is going to make a lot uh also I just assumed that that steam version was a joke of them always just saying that it was coming soon and that was just gonna be like that forever so when I actually saw it got a real release my mind was kind of blown yeah I think it was just like they you're like we're we're old now we need to have like a real steady source of guaranteed income like uh right the final the final nail in that coffin I woke up this morning and it felt like Christmas came early I don't think I had been this excited for like a day one release of game since like the PS2 era

um do we have any more to say about FTL I feel like yeah I think I think I think we've covered it pretty let's let's we gotta rate it right yeah to rankings so what you know everyone on this show is a a data freak so you know we're trying to to make sure that we're don't drag me down to your level come on well but uh but yeah I'll go first I think unsurprisingly this game uh I I've been uh co-opted by by Will to give games an objective number rating as well as like a like a point in time ranking as well what do you know in your your guys's show you know you've you've always had like what rank would you give it right now and I like I like that element um but I think like for me like giving context of like okay where do I think this game consists um and then like where does it kind of sit against games that we've ranked so far uh I'm gonna give this game a I'm gonna give FTL a 9.5 I think out of 10 on the Scott system uh where I think everyone here has their own different rating systems but for me unsurprisingly that'll be my new number one game ahead of binding Binding of Isaac um I think like my my first impression with with this game was kind of negative or just like I didn't get it and then when I started playing more into the breach and getting that kind of like Flow State and understanding like yeah you have to like bounce these powered systems with what you actually like want to do ability wise and then coming back to FTL on like FTL feels like it's it's almost um like a more Advanced or complicated version of that to some degree I guess I haven't played the the into the breach Advanced Edition yet but we'll come wait another station yeah they like a few weeks ago I think they just came out with uh with additional content for it mind blown I gotta go you guys I gotta go right now let's finish this but uh but yeah I think like if if you're remotely interested in into the breach or roguelike games in general like if you have a a like mild experience like with this game like give it give it some time to kind of like sit and mature and like see how the systems interact and play with each other and then open up the wiki on the other side of the window and just follow that for all of your stuff I think like being able to to beat that Rebel Flagship at the end I feel like is just such a cathartic moment that if you can make it to that stage and get there it'll be well worth it probably best to do it on easy I'll say like yeah I I know I'm I like really stressing trying to do it on normal but I guess in hindsight if I would have known the difficulty curve easy would probably be the way I play the game well it's easy easy allows you to learn like what will happen with the different events and to kind like there's so little room for like air and wasting scrap on normal um that like easy is the way to like buy different systems and try them out and see how they work yeah I didn't feel like I won often enough on easy for it to feel like a cheap Victory right like I want to win a certain percent of time or at least 20 20 is a target slate Aspire the top players and Ascension 20 win 20 at a time I think that's a nice nice Target okay Mr slightest spider that's the I I can't stop I mean like you're talking I mean I put more than hours in anyone so I mean that game rules um what do you where are you putting uh FTL will how you rank this one oh well um I'm gonna give it it's it's the best of the the games we played so far so it's a number one out of in that terms of that ranking but in terms of its raw value I gave it a 7.5 out of 10 which means on my I got a my own personal tracker I've got 167 games in here that puts it um at uh number actually it's at number 100. I really only play good games and so I've got uh 90 I guess uh excuse me rank 99 um so I've got 98 games that are better than it sitting in here and uh wow I mean it's a good game don't get me wrong but there's just a lot of um well do you know what your average on that on that spreadsheet is uh on on yeah so that's why I said when uh earlier we're chatting like we're really filling out the bottom of this one because I don't tend to play like bad games but you see like I feel like a 7.5 on the will scale might actually like not yeah average is 7.37 so okay so it's above average for will it's slightly above average yeah so it's worth playing I can definitely recommend it I might I might give it an eight if I maybe with the Multiverse or like I don't know it felt very my problem is it felt very repetitive at the very end and that first 15 seconds of every fight where you're just like okay everything's charging up they're not boarding me and now I just sit here and wait oh and now we get to play I do feel like the eight sectors may be a little much like it might feel a little better if it was six and so like a full run through you know took an hour yeah um because definitely kind of once you figure out what your ship is doing it you just kind of press on like

uh uh so I was going to give it a score out of uh using the warp factor from Star Trek and then I looked up the the Memory Alpha Wiki Star Trek Wiki and it's like extraordinarily long and complicated I don't understand how warfactor works well word factor in Star Trek is like asymptotic to 10 right or like yeah go to warp nine and then go to warp 9.999999 yeah apparently warp 10 is infinity speed um so I'm going to I'm going to Pivot to uh uh is that it is one of ten well I'm gonna say it's it's uh 0.9 light speed which is now that I'm thinking about the name of the game that actually I'm just gonna go with a 9 out of 10. I'm gonna just just walk that right back to a normal score uh nine out of ten uh most it's the game I've liked the most are the ones we've played so far um I expect it to stay high on that rankings um it's pretty high on my just regular games that I've played in the past rankings like I I can see the criticisms that will has leveled against it but they did not impact my how much I got sucked into the game and now even I I did not play this game in the last week and even like thinking about it the sum of the music has gotten stuck in my head like it's got it it has that like worm it's just drilled into my head from playing it years ago uh I think that's a mark of a pretty good game yeah Woody is our special guest this is by default uh your number one game uh on this podcast uh but but where do you think this would fit in your uh Pantheon of roguelike game specifically that you that you've played like would this be on like the upper end the middle well I mean you sent me a list of you know some of the games that you were going to cover and I sent you a list back of like these are the games I'm willing to be on so anytime you hear me on this podcast I probably like the game uh and so this is definitely in in my upper um upper realm this is different than most of the roguelikes I play usually I play roguelikes that are very sort of Twitchy like you Spelunky or your gungeon or your dead cells and you just kind of get physically better at playing the game whereas here this is one of the few Rolex I really like that's built mostly on Mountain menus and has more sort of thoughtful strategic gameplay um so I'm gonna give this game uh two breech missiles and a halberd beam um I'm just a real sucker for like clean game design where um it feels like all of the elements are sort of working in unison and both you and the sort of the quote-unquote enemies play by the same rules I love that um and I just think that between this and into the breach like these guys are just total Masters at having something that feels like a brilliantly designed board game but has a level of complexity that would be wouldn't really work in a board game um so yeah I think this game is great um it's it's a heart uh hearty recommend for people who have not played it and like I said not just as like an interesting um influencer on later roguelike games but just because it's like a great super unique game nine out of 10 would crush Rebels again yes definitely sweet uh well for for our podcast you can send emails into grogpodzone gmail.com uh I I wound up uh jumping on the uh the abandoned abandoning Twitter train and spun up a a Grog pod a mastodon instance so if you better I mean so far so good because uh so you can find us on grogpod at Game Dev dot place on Mastodon okay uh where I've been I've been lurking on it I've been spying out and seeing all the other like you know indie game Deads who have moved over and for like the like week and a half that I was on Twitter like I think Mastodon for me feels like a safer space sure I don't know I'm I'm again very happy knocking wood I never got into Twitter so um but website is grogpod.zone you can find us there for all of our our ranking I'm also glad I'm glad that you guys are called grogpot I like that name a lot it sticks in my head because I first I remember that it was about it was called growing Rogue so I searched for that and I got a bunch of like anti-government like um like far-right libertarian stuff and I'm like oh I'm glad Scott is podcast isn't buried under all this SEO I mean that was the original design of the podcast but yeah the SEO yeah so I like rock pod that's uh it sounds delicious it's more fun to say yeah it's all that was my number one criteria um Woody what uh this this is your your platform to to spam all the stuff that you've got going on so all this stuff which is actually one thing and which is a thing that's coming to an end um my friend Steve and I for the past six years have been putting out uh podcasts we did um Ultra 64 is the the first thing we did that's a very if you listen to that podcast you might hear some suspicious similarities to this particular podcast yeah patent pending patent pending um we we played all the games on the Nintendo 64. and then uh lately we've played all the games on the Wii U and so each each episode is um a game or you know up to three or four games at a time and uh the Wii U is actually coming to an end um so we'll be finishing up after this six year run or so um so if you're ever curious what the best game on Nintendo 64 is or the best game on Wii U game is or conversely the 47th best game on each system we we have you covered um that's go yeah the ultra 64 or Wii universe either of those I'll get you there Transformers resource transmittals exactly we know we all know the answer to that one um so but before we go we have to uh I wish I hadn't packed away my dice uh because I would make dice roll sound dice roll sound uh play a quick round of roguelike roulette where we're going to try to figure oh okay Colin's got his dice dice going there um where from our our candidates list we'll randomly select three of them to pick or and and picking from that random selection of what do we want to cover next so our random selection that we pulled out this time are the three games sort of the Stars the pit the 1980 version of rogue and voidigo and I had posted this list in in our Discord earlier for us just to kind of like do some pre-reading and kind of assess it but talk about it on the on on air which one of these do we have like a vote for unanimously of like oh we got to do this one

uh and I I looked up a a let's play of Sword of the stars and the first thing that popped up was uh a a guy saying move it or lose it ape and that really seals the deal for me um anytime where I'm a weird Space Marine and the the sergeants yelling at me to uh get into combat and uh do my part I'm I'm on board for that and I don't think that we're I don't think we've we've leveled up enough to play the OG Rogue yet we need to play we need to play the Clones first and then go back to square it okay well I was gonna I mean this was po that you posted this last night 9 30. I was whopping at 18 hours now okay I didn't realize we're making the decision today because I have not looked into any of these but just on face value I'd say oh yeah let's let's go to the original but like um I can't say I don't know I think I'm gonna oh well I'll I'll defer uh to our guests to throw in a vote as well uh Woody I don't know if of these of these three games do you have one that stands out like yeah you guys gotta definitely play this one uh I mean the only game of those three that I've heard of is Rogue um but I I agree with Colin that maybe that's something you have to build up to it either should have been your first episode or uh something that comes much later I've been the final boss yeah exactly yeah the rebel the rebel Starship I've been debating for because the the road that's released on Steam is like a Dos version of it which I think is kind of like the closest that you can get to like a stable easily accessible version of it but I've I've had in mind to like try to see if I can see if someone has like a really old computer from like the early 80s and that like is able to terminal into like a really old server from the 80s because like the 1980 Rogue you had to install on a server and then you had to as like effectively SSH into it but uh but like yeah tunnel tunnel into the server to play the road on something that wasn't your computer what was the other game that you mentioned beside the sword of the stars um so the the our random list for this time is sort of the Stars the pit the 1980 version of Rogue or voidigo avoidigo Multiverse

and what do you think this one looks much more like something that Woody Yeah well yeah but um I mean I'm not planning to be on it but I'm gonna go check out boy to go right now because this game looks good twitch Rogue shooting at stuff it's a very dungeony lots of lots of uh big Graphics yeah overwhelmingly positive is that that really works for me the steam God Steam Reviews are so useless what do I do I want to overwhelmingly positive very positive like in what other world is like mostly positive like you know that that game is a pile of garbage if it's emotionally positive I mean 67 and then it goes and then it goes down to mixed and it starts being good again you know it's like oh well that's because a bunch of people review bombed it yeah it's definitely good when you see like a new AAA game release that's like mostly negative all right well whatever you guys decide I gotta play some new some more into the breach and I gotta add void to go to my steam wish list so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm not gonna dictate what you guys should play I think I'm gonna make an executive decision and have us uh continue continue the this early series of roguelikes with sort of the Stars next time uh I think Colin kind of nailed it I played the the tutorial for that and it definitely has a kind of Starship Trooper Z get in there a you know the uaps want to live forever kind of vibe to it uh and for Will's benefit it has machine guns so I think it'll it'll uh it'll speak all of that but yeah the rest of them will will keep in our back pocket to re-roll for next time and I see voidigo is still actually technically in Early Access it is and yeah I think that like and that's another thing with like some of these games is like they can and I think voidigo's been out for a while like at least like a year and a half or so but yeah like games that are sort of perpetually in Early Access I guess you can almost lump a Dwarf Fortress into this to some degree anymore yeah I guess it's not technically steam Early Access but uh uh but yeah um I think as long as the game seems like it's in a relatively mature enough State we'll we'll consider it but cool um so it's gonna be sort of the Stars until it dies or we find something better sort of the Stars the pit uh will be our episode for next time uh we'll see you there with uh all sorts of alien spiders machine guns and uh and making sure to charge up our our FTL drives to get us there but uh yeah thanks for thanks for joining us Woody uh we'll we'll have you back on again for some more episodes and uh we'll see you guys next time maybe I'll be here for boy to go oh yeah maybe yeah it's been fun
