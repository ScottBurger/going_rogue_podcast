Hello everyone and welcome back to yet another episode of the Grogpod Rogue Like podcast where each episode we save our fans from the world of Roblox by picking and raiding a Rogi type game and putting the best of them into a big happy house at the end of the season in our finale tournament.
0:58
I am your Oh Woo Chibi anime host Scott Berger and collabing with me on this episode are my Flesh Tuber Co hosts.
Hey, it's Andrew Hollow man, Harsh man here.
And I'm calling a random shrimp or drug or something.
1:18
I'm really not sure what it is.
And we are joined with a a super special guest for this episode.
Who is our special guest joining us?
Hello, I'm Danny Roo weirdfer and I stream on twitch at Danny Roo 17.
I'm a variety streamer and also a cat.
Please come on down.
1:33
Come down, down.
Welcome aboard.
We're happy to have you.
And of course, the viewers.
The viewers, pardon me, the listeners won't be able to see that Annie's graced us in AV tuber form.
And what a fine V tuber the the avatar you have there.
1:54
Brilliantly animated technology at its best, legitimately.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Amazing to see how far technology has come.
Well, yes, this week, very apropos and on theme, we are turning our Kawhi up to 11 with our episode of Hollow Cure Save the Fans, released on Steam or well, I guess released on Itch and Steam August 16th, 2023.
2:19
You yeah, you can find it on Itch and Steam.
This has developed almost entirely the solo dev effort by a person named KU who has also recently, if I'm pronouncing their name right, also so recently developed a a fighting game along the the similar vibes of what we're talking about today called hollow X break.
2:41
It's kind of your side scrolling beat em up fighting game released on March 19th 2024.
Hollow cure this week.
Your average player of this game has about 28 hours in it, and it cranks in on our popularity data set from Steam at the number 37th most popular Rd. light game with 29,118 total reviews.
3:07
Danny, as our special guest this week, you have the honor of describing what one does in Hollow Cure in one sentence before the gigantic Buff Goose man wearing a backwards baseball cap bashes you.
OK, wow, that's specific.
Oh yeah, it's very similar to Vampire Survivors where you kill all the characters, pick up the experience points, and then get a random slot of gear and items to try to better yourself and character.
3:37
Now the, the the thing that I think separates this from a lot of other I've been playing a lot of Vampire Survivor likes this the past week or so to try to like come to grasp like.
So our episode previous to this one, we did the eponymous Vampire Survivors, the titular entry in the genre.
3:57
And since then, there's been a lot, a lot, a lot of fast follow games, games that have been developed in a similar kind of style, bullet heaven, single stick shooter, whatever you want to call them.
And I think the thing that stands out the most from this game compared to those is it's art and aesthetic style.
4:19
And so the first thing that you're going to boot up when you see this game is quite the color splash.
And I think charming whimsy, right, just injected right into your eyeballs for this this wild world of V tubing, which I think for for Andrew and Andrew, Colin and I is not a realm that we have a whole lot of experience.
4:47
So my first bullet point here in the Google doc says, Danny, help us.
What is this world of V tubers?
Well, best way to put it is we decided that the rear world sucks, so we wanted to be anime girls or boys or cats.
5:02
That's the main point.
You can be literally anything, which in a world of of like Instagram influencers, being able to be not what you are helps a lot.
It gives an.
It opens the door for people who don't fit specific criteria.
5:20
Yeah.
Here I am.
I am a cat.
A cat with a a couple mushrooms and some well placed Diet Coke advertising there.
Yeah, I think like there's there's some like V like well, So what separates AV tuber from like a regular YouTube?
5:39
Because like some some people that I follow on YouTube that make well YouTube content for gaming and I'll I'll shout out big simple is one that that I follow for rogue like content specifically.
There's another couple people like art of Zod, who streams a lot of barony previous episode and mirror the moth a a moth tuber who streams a lot of vampire survivors.
6:06
Maybe I'll throw I'll throw Mark Zuckerberg in there too for for all of his his stuff too feels very V tuber.
So what what like what separates having like a little animated avatar that kind of like jumps around and speaks as as the person is casting?
6:24
Like how?
How's that different than the V tubing world specifically?
Content wise, honestly there's not that much different.
They're both streamers, both creators.
Usually the V tuber will have more like back story, more lore, more fantasy involved like like a YouTube is hi I'm Markiplier he's a dude like well people have is where.
6:48
He went to college.
Yeah, so people with avatars are story characters and often also have the benefit of having a lot more anominity if they need it.
And so.
Well, actually I've so most of the people who are, I mean it seems like there's V tube and then even more specifically the hollow live.
7:09
Yeah, Hollow live Very.
Specific.
Is a corporation of Youtubers.
Right.
And it seems like it's it's like a subset of it, but are most of the most and or all of the people who are V tubing anonymous or is there?
Some crossover or there is a crossover at times some people have like I know like a voice actor who likes to does the voice of like ocean B stars is currently AV tuber now, but people obviously know who he is.
7:37
The hollow live girls have most of them have it like tried to be under wraps of who they are, but some of them have real life.
Also YouTube personas that people know who they are, but it's a unspoken rule if you know who they are in real life.
No, you don't.
Yeah, that makes sense.
7:53
And the the disconnect and this game is nothing short on the amount of of characters that you can select.
So I guess to be clear, in, in this game, you are instead of Vampire Survivors picking a very legally distinct Castlevania Sprite knockoff, in this case, you are actually picking like one of these actual like V tuber characters to like run around and effectively do that same Vampire survivor kind of kind of deal.
8:22
But you know, I, I, I'm looking through and through these names and none of these names for, for me.
Like I have no idea what any of these names mean, but I'm sure like out there people are like, I'm, I'm gonna pick one.
I don't even know how to pronounce half of these.
8:40
OK, I'll pick this one.
I, I, I'm guessing this is pronounced Iris.
Iris and and so so Danny, like if I just said Iris, would you know exactly who that is and like their back story and everything?
Or is it pretty specific in some cases?
Yes, Iris.
8:55
That's, yeah, Iris.
She's from Hollow.
Hollow Live English.
She's a half Angel, half demon, a nephilim, and she's come to Earth for unclear reasons.
Come to Earth to stream video games, apparently.
9:11
Yeah, she was a solo one unit they made because she's a a talented singer and they wanted to have her be in the company.
Mm hmm.
And so these are all like all the characters here, like they are actual like.
Actual people, actual performers that work for the company, even some of the bosses.
9:30
Yeah, to your to your .0, Yeah, I'm interested to discuss the back story of some of the bosses 'cause I'm quite curious and was, oh boy, let me tell you, I was.
And the bosses always catch you off guard.
They absolutely do.
And I was laughing with such delight when I got to the boss at the end of the third level.
9:49
Like I was laughing hard enough that it was it was impacting my game play and that almost cost me.
Cost me around, but to your point Scott, about like not knowing what's going on, I feel a little bit embarrassed cuz I've known Danny for a while and I feel like I should know more about this space than I do.
10:07
But I have a similar experience, like playing this game for like is is is it's it's it's as if I had played like what what it would be like to play Super Smash, Smash Brothers and not be familiar with like the Nintendoverse.
10:22
It's like, right.
I'm like, yeah, hey, it was this, it was this elf looking guy in green jumping around.
Well, I guess he's probably got a back story or something.
I don't know.
So I was interested, you know, going into reviewing this game, whether whether the game would still be enjoyable.
10:40
Spoilers.
It is even if you have like no idea what's going on or or little idea of what's going on.
Yeah, I almost think that's like that's an advantage for for people who who aren't in the V tuber scene to some degree or like, oh man, I really like Vampire survivors.
10:59
What are some other games like that?
What the hell is this thing?
And I think there's there's there's two things.
There's one is like the amount of like bath, well, to me, baffling content that I'm just like, what even is this?
11:15
There's alligators and trench coats.
There's skeletons with baseball bats.
Like it is it is so like wild and different to like any other sort of like game asset that I've experienced.
And it's it's like it feels very like creative and new, like a very fresh take on, you know, like there's a ton of vampire survivor's clones out there.
11:37
Oh, yeah, it's a, you know.
Oh, it's another zombie.
OK, yeah, I've seen, I've seen zombies.
I know what a zombie is.
I don't know what this gigantic humongous head with a like a silver like head who's like the CEO of the company or something running around dropping.
11:57
The little Yago monster.
Yes, I feel like there's there's a certain amount of of baffling fun to be had if you if you know nothing about the game going in.
And then I think the other aspect is like the colorful fun vibe to it.
12:16
I played a lot of, I don't know, I must have played like six or seven other vampire survivors like games and they're all they're all very dark and grim and you know you're out, then you're fighting giant spiders and things.
And this game has very much more of like a light hearted fun, like sunshine and rainbows, like at least initial kind of impression to it.
12:41
And I'm like, Oh yeah, this this feels like a nice a nice like cotton candy, like fun version of that instead of just like, Oh yeah, another another grim dark kind of thing.
But.
Part of that obviously is like the subject matter, like you're, you know, basing this off all of these V tubers and characters that are, you know, general on average, like pretty upbeat and like kawaii and like happy go lucky with exceptions, I'm sure, But also another part of it.
13:13
It's a fan project.
And so it kind of makes sense that you'd want to present it in this sort of celebratory light.
Like let's, let's make this game that is.
If I were to summarize this in one sentence, it's like this is this game is a love letter to the Hollow Life Corporation.
There you go with a few playful jabs.
13:30
I thought it was interesting.
So it's, it's free.
And I kept waiting of like, all right, where's the monetization stuff?
And then finally when I went and looked at it was like, Oh no, it's actually just free.
Like there's not.
It's just because people really are into this scene and want to make something as an expression of their joy in that scene, which I think is.
13:52
If they were to take money, which people have said they want to give them money, they're like, if I do that, then I have to follow every rule they have and then I can't make the content the way I want to make the content.
And it gets weird with like, well, are you, are you compensating the people whose avatars are in the game and all that stuff?
14:08
It's like, well, no, it it kind of reminds me almost of a like the modding community where you look at some of the mods for Skyrim or Factorial or some of the the rim world and the amount of work that has gone into them is not less than the amount of work that would go into any other video game.
14:29
Like people put an insane amount of work into something that they're very passionate about.
And this is definitely one of those like.
Yeah, there's a It's worth noting that everyone loves listening to podcasts where people just read stuff off Wikipedia, so it's my turn to do that.
So there's a line here that says.
14:46
KU, the developer, stated that he wasn't interested in monetizing Hollow Cure and that he earned enough working as an animator to fund the game's low development cost.
He went on to say, quote, as long as I can continue living comfortably, have time to work on the game and people are enjoying the game, that's all that matters to me, which is like, yeah, I mean, it's just like that's that's such like a generous kind of like, you know, fun vibe to have for like this kind of community that I feel like like as an outsider for me, like I get the sense that there is this kind of like very communal fun vibe Ness going on.
15:18
And I think that like, it's also like pretty clear from this game that like this game's like slam dunk animations that you can like, you can tell that the person who is like the lead on this game is, is a very talented animator.
15:34
And I think that like absolutely shows through 'cause like, again, a lot of the other like Vampire Survivor likes that I've been playing like just don't have as good of like flow, I guess to them.
Or, or like, you know, it's, it's again, audio podcast, different format.
15:50
But the, I feel like the animation Sprite design in this game and just like the animation, just pixel art design itself is like so well done that yeah, I can, I can see why this game is so highly rated.
16:10
But anyway, coming back to, to, yeah, like why, why this game, Danny, was there something about Hollow Cure that drew you to it?
What was it just like, oh, this is a game for the V tuber community?
Or was this something that you kind of organically discovered besides that?
16:29
Well, I was already a fan of many of the Hollow Live Girls, so when they someone made a fan game of featuring the girls, I was like, oh, I want to play this.
And thankfully even the Hollow Live Girls played a lot of it as well.
So it was, it was given very, very large publicity when people in the game are playing the game for you.
16:49
So everyone knew about it very quickly.
How often do you get to watch the character of your video game playing that same video game like a weird inception?
Level and they like they go to like actually like talk directly to him, like, hey, you should do this.
17:05
And he'd be like, oh, OK.
Now what's one thing that I found that was interesting for this was that Hollow Cure was was nominated for the V Tuber Awards for Stream Game of the Year versus I don't I OK, so I have heard of one of these other games.
17:26
I have heard of Baldur's Gate three.
I haven't heard of only up or I'm going to pronounce this wrong, but Suika game, I think it's a switch game.
Yeah, Suika game, and so only up Suika game, Baldur's Gate 3 and Hollow Cure.
17:41
For V2 seen only up.
Isn't that that's the one with like the hammer, right?
Or Oh no, no, no, never mind, I know what this is.
Yeah, it's one of those games you climb up forever and ever, and if you fall down it punches you bad.
But I thought for sure that Hollow Cure would be a lock for the V Tuber Awards stream Game of the Year, but it wasn't it.
18:03
It actually, I guess the Suika game was the one that swept it, which I guess I don't know, Like, would that be a little too on the nose of like, you know, the V Tuber game-winning, the V Tuber Game of the Year award?
Maybe every speed tuber was playing squeak.
18:19
Mostly only the hollow.
The girls are playing Hollow live so.
Interesting.
Interesting point.
Well, everybody loves an underdog story.
You can come back next year.
Hasn't officially been released, right?
Indeed, it's gonna have.
More updates.
For a hollow cure.
Yeah.
18:35
He's.
He intends to add every single girl and there is a good 90 girls and they keep making more and he also wants to add the Hollow Stars, which is the male version of Hollow Live, so he just wants to add everybody.
Wow, yeah, I mean.
There's that's, that's like 130 characters at this point.
18:52
Yeah, there's, there's so many, I mean.
And there's AI mean, so that's one of the big they have individual weapons for every single one, which is also true of something like Vampire Survivors, but you're not committing yourself to doing 130 of them.
19:10
Yeah, I guess crucially the.
Character's Lord's help.
There's also some, some key gameplay differences between this and Vampire Survivors.
We're like, yeah, Vampire Survivor's like, Oh yeah, this is the guy that starts with the knife or the the the axe or the whip or something like common weapon, you know, items that you would pick up incidentally this you actually have like special abilities and stuff that I think wind up changing the gameplay flow significantly from what I would initially expect.
19:42
I I liked that.
I mean the I thought that the specials seemed like they made a remarkable difference to how you play the game.
Like Vampire Survivor's great game.
I like it a lot, but it is mostly you just.
20:01
Moving and dodging stuff.
And there's not, there's not a lot.
There's like flow state decisions, but they're not, you're not firing at anything.
And I mean, I've been playing, I've played vampire starters mostly on my phone.
So I did not have the ability to look in a direction and shoot in a different direction, which I found to be crucial in playing this game.
20:21
So there's there's it's there are two actions that you can do, which is more than the like half an action that you can do in Vampire Survivors, IE just move.
And I was surprised at how much of a difference that made in the gameplay.
20:37
I guess maybe I shouldn't have been, but.
For sure, for sure.
Initially I thought, oh cool, like I have the option to aim my attacks.
And then I realized pretty early on I'm like, no, that's that's kind of required.
I mean, there are some of the characters who have more of AI, don't know Vampire Survivors kind of way controlling, I suppose.
20:57
But on average, I I found the crosshair to be mandatory.
And yeah, it was really delightful to discover like, oh, this isn't just, you know, a soulless clone like this has its own unique gameplay flow for sure.
21:13
Yeah, it was very different playing this game than I want.
To pass that group.
If this was like what, what the difference is between like Bullet Heaven games that allow you this kind of like fake twin stick shooter Ness versus something like Vampire Survivors where you don't have that option to like direct your aim.
21:34
So I was playing, I was playing a lot of Halls of Torment, which is like very, it's a, you know, Vampire Survivor's clone, but like almost a twin stick shooter in a sense, 'cause like you, you can decide when to shoot.
You can't decide where to aim.
21:50
And in this game, I was in Holocure, I was like feeling like, OK, I feel incentivized to, to aim.
And it feels like a silly thing to say of like, well, yeah, I'm, I'm aiming my shots like, but is how much of A prerequisite is that do we think for something to be a Vampire Survivor's like or a, a bullet heaven?
22:11
Like?
I think like the for the Vampire Survivor episode, we were, we were talking about like one stick shooter.
And this being, I guess, like, you could play it with just, you know, one hand or one stick, but if you have the option to aim and like, are you incentivized to use that?
22:27
How does like how much like do we think that really matters for that classification?
Well, it's this is a great question of our age.
I'm glad you're, you're asking the tough questions.
It's an interesting question because, yeah, it's sort of a subtle difference, but it makes a very unsubtle and obvious like difference interesting.
22:48
It is, yeah.
I mean, distinctly different, of course.
And I think it just depends on what kind of what, what mood you're in when you sit down to play a game.
And I, I appreciate that Vampire Survivors kind of demands less of you physically, but I also appreciate that Hollow Cure requires a little bit more finesse and attention.
23:15
It's, it's a little bit, it's significantly more twitchy.
I.
Think vampire if you're If you're on the bullet scale from bullet heaven to bullet hell, like Vampire Survivors is as far along the axis as you can possibly get there you.
23:31
Go.
And, and as you shift further along, you, you get a little bit more control over your character.
And I guess maybe something about like how powerful you feel relative to the enemies, how much, how much action like the, the, the end goal of Vampire Survivor is to be able to stop moving and just watch it beat the game for you.
23:51
I don't think that this game will get to that point.
And that's probably for the best.
I don't think that every game should be that.
Like you don't want all of your games to just be like, cool, I beat it.
Now I'm just going to watch bright colors on my screen for 10 more minutes.
24:09
Danny, have you played played many twin stick shooter action rogue like games before?
Not too many.
I did play Vampire Survivors for a little bit, but like I said, it was like that.
You just got after a while just kind of stare at the game and like it's just sparkling constantly.
24:27
I'm like, OK, I don't know what happens now.
What?
Yeah, there's.
Literally, I can't tell what's happening on the screen.
There were a few runs in Hollow Cure where I was kind of approaching that level of visual chaos, let's say, once I started unlocking more of the collabs and the Super weapons and and things of that nature.
24:48
Yeah, those got busy.
Yes, busy.
That's a good way to put it to Annie.
Quite busy.
Quite busy.
Not and not not, you know, in a bad way or anything.
Pretty, pretty manageable.
See, now normally there's, I guess we kind of did this at the beginning of the episode.
25:05
Usually there's a story segment where we discussed the storyline.
Did you did you have anything written in the doc about that, Scott?
I do, yeah.
And I think that like, one thing that the The Hollow live game does better than Vampire Survivors is having at least at the very least some kind of like minor story hook to, to captivate me a little and like kind of slow walk me into this world where I think like this also works very well.
25:32
Like if you have no idea what any of the V tube hollow hollow tube universe is like, you're you're greeted with this very cutesy freeze frame thing of like And of course, you know any game that starts with in the year 20 XTX.
25:50
You know that gets that gets a solid bonus that 20 XDX.
An unexpected online takeover began.
A new group of idols surfaced on the Internet known as virtual idols.
People were skeptical at first, but over time, these virtual idols gathered many fans.
26:06
And I love that like the artwork is like people like a like just someone sitting at their computer wide eyed with a pair of like glow sticks in front of their computer monitor.
And then the the screen changes to presumably some kind of evil Jack O Lantern phase.
26:22
But however, one day an evil force came in and took advantage of the fans and their love.
The evil force brainwashed the fans, turning them into mindless minions.
Blinded by their own love, the V Tubers knew they had to help their fans come back to their senses, and thus began their quest to save the fans.
26:42
And then you hit the go button, and it's just like a rainbow of sunshine and happy colors, like, injected right into your face.
That really kind of sets the tone of like, all right, we're off on this mission.
We're gonna, we're gonna pick some, some wacky V Tubers and Riddle me this podcast.
27:02
Friends, are you destroying the fans in the game?
Was about to ask this question.
Hollow Cure save the fans.
It seems like you're saving them and with with extreme prejudice.
Yeah.
27:17
Like a anime.
You're just like, ah yes, I freed him.
He sliced throat.
Putting them out their misery, I guess.
Well, you're breaking their mind control, I guess, right, like initially when I was playing, I was like, all right, I was kind of, you know, I couldn't couldn't help but in my mind, you know, be like kind of directly comparing this to vampire survivor and it's like, all right, first, first, first item very important or near the top.
27:41
It's like, what do the what do the death animations look like in in vampire survivors?
You get this cool like image of there's some custom death animations, but the average minion just sort of gets dematerialized and tossed to the wind and scattered to the wind.
28:03
But in this game, like I think they just kind of fade out and I'm like, well, that's kind of boring, but at the same time.
But then later I realized, well, it's probably good that it's like a really basic death animation because otherwise it would be maybe a little bit two more better than be some kind of a sinister implication.
So no, I don't think the yeah, obviously the the virtual idols are saving them by teleporting them away to the Hollow house or something.
28:30
I don't know.
Danny.
Is there a lore explanation Danny?
Yeah, is it?
Is it?
I seem to not that I do.
Offer this.
I seem to recall reading something that like the the fans of certain idols are represented in the game via various like enemy types.
28:50
I know.
Just kind.
Of the character types are basically like mascot characters that all the characters usually have.
So like the shrimp you see is the mascot character of Agura.
The skeleton is called the Deadbeat, and he's the mascot of Mori Kaliopi.
29:05
So they're all actually like the mascots of each individual girl.
It's all coming together.
We're we're unraveling the the, the mystery and what and what's going on with The Who are the salamanders associated with the red lizards in the first level?
Oh, those are shrimps.
Oh, they're shrimp.
29:23
Yeah, they're shrimps.
I'm like what do you what shrimps do you guys talking about?
Yes, A.
Shark's feet I've got.
Sick again, Shrimps for.
A head cold brain.
I blame I, I can't be held accountable for anything.
And you got Yeah, and you have the.
Those are the shrimps.
Of course, but with a needle in it or I'm not exactly sure it.
29:41
Even looking on the wiki, it's not 100% sure.
How does a shrimp wield a riot shield?
But oh, OK, yeah.
It's a shrimp holding it down because why not?
Outstanding.
Outstanding.
And of course we've already stabs.
The artwork is wonderful.
I'm just a dope.
29:57
I don't know how to how to look at pixel art.
That is one of the downsides of a game like this is that when you get deeply into the game, you don't get time to appreciate the art assets because you're just just like, Oh, my God, all I can see is bullets and that one narrow sliver of stuff that I have to, like, I have to run there.
30:21
I mean, like, if you ask me what are the enemy types on the third level, I could not tell you because I don't know if I saw them.
I just saw things coming to get me.
And I yeah, I, I'm, I'm now, I'm on the wiki looking at all of it.
30:36
And this is like, oh.
Wow.
Well, Colin, you have your you have your Mega Matsurisu, you have your Rosati and you have your giant hot on the degenerate, which all those words sound like complete gibberish to me, but I'm sure Danny is just like, Yep, that reminds me of season season seven, episode 3 when they did this this thing.
30:58
And yeah, I mean, like, I feel like I, I've, I've seen enough episodes of Dragon Ball that I know that like, you know, there's, there's like a million inside jokes about things and like to some extent it can feel a little inside jokey.
But for me, it feels like the it's just so overwhelming that like, and I think crucially, like the the cutesy art style makes it feel approachable that like, yeah, there's these things that made absolutely no sense to me from the outset.
31:28
But, you know, it's a, it's a, a squirrel with big cheeks running around that's cute.
Like, I can, I can get behind that.
Or like this thing that's like a, like, I guess it's a spider with a single eye with its mouth stitched shut.
Question mark.
It's a glide your pig with its head cut off and stitch back on.
31:49
OK, perfect.
More sense.
I understand, I change.
Of course, the the Halloween level, so opportunity to get real spooky while we're discussing specific enemies and things.
So I alluded to the Halloween level final boss.
Who or what?
32:06
Who's that?
Who's the giant spider girl spider Chama Carpenter.
Yeah, meets Hello.
Kitty, sorry, Yeah.
That's spider Chama.
32:21
It's a a non a shame Mumae drew her as a a joke when she was drawing all the holiday girls as strange messed up creatures.
It's a version of akai Hata, who's also known as hot Chama.
She's best known for making a series of cooking shows, which were terrifying to watch.
32:41
But.
She was not good at cooking.
She made a a soup and didn't decide, you know what, I'm going to put a tarantula in it.
And everyone's like, why?
It's like, because so here she is.
Fire Challenge.
The the weapon upgrade as well.
32:58
Excellent, outstanding, good.
What a call back.
It's like I appreciate one.
Of her most famous clips.
Excellent.
I I appreciate that the creator has the you know, opportunity in the bandwidth and the the ability to pull like A1 random joke sketch and make that an entire boss like is is is not something that you would see in a traditionally developed game.
33:24
So very cool, very cool and specific.
And yeah, this this particular boss makes quite the quite, quite the interest.
And it was legitimately this boss battle was for me like one of it's it's it's got to be it's easily on my top five gaming moments of 2024 so far.
33:47
Like this was a between it being a very funny looking character and also equal parts terrifying and and it being like a tough and engaging fight.
It was exhilarating.
34:02
Let me tell you when I got that, you know, congratulations.
Successful essentially beat the the level screen.
It was a pretty great, pretty great.
Good times.
Yeah.
But what about that duck man?
Oh yeah.
Shoe Bungalian.
34:18
Yeah.
So that name, Shoo Bungalian, it's a Subaru, the tomboy character.
Because of her, the way her voice sounds very kind of gravely.
People made a joke saying she was a duck and she just kind of went with it.
34:33
And then she made a giant Minecraft sculpture of that duck, giant buff duck, and she named it Shoo Bungalian Shooba and Evangelion.
And it just everyone's like, wow, OK, Became a feature.
I'm looking at her entire mind base.
34:50
Very impressive, very impressive.
So I, I can only assume that as as delighted as I was to see this, you know, the, the random boss that I didn't actually know what it was, but the, the side of it was, you know, dramatic enough to, to get in a response out of me.
I imagine that it's, it's that much more delightful for a fan who's playing a level for the first time and encountering these different creatures and things for the first time.
35:15
So that's there's something to be said for that as well.
Oh yeah, hey, look at that.
It's once in a full anime artwork treatment on Shoe Mongolian.
I want to talk a little.
Bit about long giants.
A little giant hot dog on the end.
Sorry.
35:31
The the bosses in this game also offer a a element that's very unique and distinct from Vampire Survivors.
Where in that, you know, you would just like survive to 30 minutes and then you know, the the death Sprite comes in quickly and annihilates you and there's really not much you can do up until a certain point.
35:50
Whereas with this, like I'd be, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you have 4 stages in Holocure and you have like 4, I guess alternate hard mode stages to them.
But for these four stages, each stage has a number of mini bosses and I guess like main normal bosses who who show up after a certain amount of time, not not like 30 minutes worth, but like we were just talking, you know, the, the backwards wearing backwards hat wearing like buff duck man shows up at the 10 minute mark, which is much faster than 30 minutes.
36:29
And if I'm, if I remember right, you just have to beat like the first boss in order to get to the next level.
Is that right or do you have to go the full 30 minutes?
No, you have to meet the second boss.
Second boss.
Yeah, which is like 20 minutes, yeah.
Yeah, the game is at average 20 minutes. 20 minutes is when the second final boss shows up.
36:48
Mm Hmm.
'Cause I remember like one of my sticking points with Vampire Survivors was like, oh man, when you like you're first starting and you haven't unlocked that turbo mode at the onset, like 30 minutes feels like a long time.
Whereas with this, it's like, you know, the, the first, like, you know, 5 or 10 minutes, you'll, you know, you're getting your feet set, you're, you're getting used to the level.
37:08
And then, like, by the time that you've had, you know, only a few minutes to breathe and and upgrade, like bam, boss fight right in your face.
You're like, oh, damn, I got to, I got to make sure all my stuff is in order.
And then, you know, you only have a certain amount of time before the second boss shows up, which I thought was a, was a very unique and different way of doing it, at least compared to also, you know, the other survivor likes that I've been playing.
37:34
So I, I did appreciate that.
How do we feel about the the need for upgrades in terms of stage progression, the meta?
Progression.
Is that what you're referring?
To yes, that's the word for it.
Well, I have no need for them because I don't recognize the UI existence, the existence UI principle of tabs.
37:58
So when I was going in, she.
Upgraded.
Sure you don't need you don't need them, it's just recommended.
I was grinding the second level for like 6 hours based on just the first page of upgrades and like spamming the the the gotcha game.
38:16
Like getting the same character over and over again to like power them up 'cause I didn't realize they were like the generic ones.
I should have googled it earlier.
So again, I blame it on.
Well, to be fair, it it did take me as shockingly long amount of time to see that your your meta progression upgrade shop, which again, like to Colin's point about like, you know, oh, there's got to be monetization hidden somewhere.
38:41
Nope, this is all in game currency that like you unlock at a very reasonable clip.
You know, there's there's the things that you you unlock like, ah, yes, click this to unlock the stamps.
Click this to unlock your the the mode that allows you to use your your character's special abilities.
39:00
That's all well and good.
And then I think like it just needs to be made more visible, like up at the top.
The second tab is like here's the thing like this is the stuff to like upgrade all of the characters attack power, defense, speed pick up.
All the main stats.
39:16
All the main stats.
And to be fair, the game does, you know, definitely give you a really obvious hint where it's like you go to select level 2 and it says recommended upgrades.
And I'm like, well, I don't recognize those icons.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm going to keep going.
And I did find like a Steam, like a like a Steam, you know, forum thread on it.
39:36
So I mean, we're the only people.
And also one more thing.
To be fair, that particular UI decision is kind of unique to that page.
I I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.
I don't know, but I agree.
I would I would appreciate just a slightly larger thing.
39:52
But ultimately, at the end of the day, I suppose it's it's on me for not noticing that.
And the fact that I didn't like rage quit at some point during those six hours is testing it to how, like, pretty fun this game is.
And generally, like I have very little patience for grinding and this game requires a little bit of grinding like to to, you know, get enough coins to get these upgrades.
40:14
To answer your question, Scott, I feel pretty good about the, the meta progression in this game cuz it's, it's a fun game to play and it's, you know, pretty engaging.
You don't get stuck in the same kind of boredom loop that you can sometimes have with, with games like vampire Survivors where like there's not a whole lot going on.
40:31
There's like almost always something going on that is, you know, requesting your, your.
Input Danny, I'm assuming you've played the most of this of any of us.
What is the like?
How many yards you got there?
What is the end game of of this like?
40:48
So after you've played it for many hours, what does the game look like?
Is it do you get all the power ups and then you player you're playing on the hard mode?
Is there is there anything that happens differently in that kind of mode?
Honestly doesn't feel like it's too much different when you're playing a hard mode.
41:05
It's the same as the normal mode except harder obviously, and you can still just as easily lose if you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah.
Keep playing you keep playing it and hope for the next update and see.
Wait for your your favorite idol to be in the game.
41:21
I'm sure you.
Spend a lot of time in the fishing mini game though, I won't lie.
That was going to be my next thing was like, I'm sure you you've had many more hours to spend upgrading your your weekend cabin to host all of the the V tuber girls to come and and do fishing mini games.
41:41
What it like?
Can you tell us more about the The Hollow House?
Oh yeah, that was added last update.
I feel like it was more of a they wanted to add something more cutesy more little less.
They wanted to add more unique things to the game.
So they made the game so you can make a little house, this little fishing mini game, a little money making mini game so you can make money without having to play the game constantly with a little fenced in area, which is a little strange that you're putting your fans in a fence and making them farm for you.
42:09
But hey.
There's the the parasocial relationship thing again.
Yeah, I thought it was fun that like the the fishing mini game was like a little mini DDR kind of thing going on.
And so like, I guess from your perspective, as the as like you're progressing through the main game, do you does it?
42:29
Well, I guess like because the Hall of House was just added recently.
Guessing.
I think I know what the answer to this is, but I'll ask anyway.
How, how necessary does it feel like the hollow house like auto money generation thing is for like light game stuff?
Does it feel like, Oh yeah, you really got to have that the hollow house economy going in order to get some later upgrades?
42:49
Or does it feel like like a totally separate thing that you don't even really need to engage with unless you're interested in it?
It does get to a point where it feels like you have to farm for money, so it is definitely something good.
So I was like, there was some farming strats, like you get a special sticker, you use a specific character and you get a lot of money and then you go to Hollow House and then they made money there.
43:07
And so it's you need to get a lot of money to upgrade all the characters, get all their outfits, upgrade all the scales, etcetera, etcetera.
So it felt very necessary for me.
I was wondering, I was like, well, where's the money sink?
It's like, or the the gold sink or whatever.
And yeah, it's getting all the characters and getting all of their outfits and getting all their stuff and getting the upgrades for them.
43:29
Like, ah, yeah, you could do, you could spend as much time as you want doing that because there's so many of them.
And I'm seeing people focus on the ones they like more.
But I mean, you got to get them all at some point.
Got.
To Speaking of which, I'm curious what us as a bunch of buffoons who don't understand the hollow verse, I'm curious what characters we ended up gravitating towards.
43:54
Scott, you mentioned that you were rocking the the Trident.
Yeah, I mean, I again, I'm, I'm, I'm so outside of the loop on, on all this, like, I don't, I don't know what any of their names are.
I just know that like there's, there's a dice rolling girl, there's scythe girl, there's a Trident girl and a detective with adorable dog girl.
44:16
I think those, those have been the ones that I've gravitated to the most because like they all do.
Like so like every character in this game is so wildly different that like there's so there's so many like new ways to explore, like, Oh, OK with this character.
How did the how does like this weapon work with this thing?
44:33
And I guess crucially also, they also have like not even just their unique weapon, but like unique skills associated with them too that you can level up.
So like, you know, you know, you might have your main Trident poking attack, but there's auxiliary skills related to the the the fisherman like nature of the character that.
44:57
Right.
Yeah, they're all like thematically.
Yeah, like like title pools and things like that, which are really neat, but for.
Really impressive the amount of variety that you didn't.
Forget about best girls.
Fresh girl, redhead, fiery Takanashi, Kiara, Phoenix girl.
She's who I beat the third level with.
45:16
She dies and if you have you use her special move and then she runs out of hit points, she comes back with full hit points and I had the thing that gave you like double attack power if you, but you had to lose 5% health per second.
And so I would end up just being like, OK, I'm I'm literally on one hit point just hanging out, waiting till that special special goes off and then hit the special immediately.
45:42
Just run into a wave of an enemy and make sure I died and pop my hit points back up to full.
It was very satisfying gameplay loop.
That was definitely my favorite run of the ones I played.
That's outstanding.
Very impressive.
A cool synergy.
Yeah, for sure.
Well, well, Scott, don't feel bad.
45:58
The the character with the Trident is Shy Lily I believe and.
No.
No.
Incorrect.
Similar thematics Girl is a shark V tuber.
46:14
Shyla Lee is a whale.
V tuber.
Oh well, obviously, how could I possibly make that mistake?
All right, I'll never mind.
I had a little anecdote about how hey, I I, I bought some like gamer stuff time product and I didn't even realize it was AV tuber.
Turns out.
V tubers are all around.
Us and and and are more ubiquitous than we would have thought.
46:34
Well, for me, I I spent a lot of time farming with Peacock feather character and also playing some of the levels as as a character and then also as the character whose special ability is to nap and slow down time, which was very very interesting.
46:54
There we go.
Who attacks with a giant like curved Diablo two act three style blade?
A a a Chris.
Yep.
And sorry, what was the name of that character again?
Danny.
Anya Anya Melfisa is the and her character is literally the embodiment of that sword, apparently.
47:14
Interesting.
Very high concept.
She's a living dagger.
And that, and yeah, the reason that I, I went with that character for my Level 3 run was that I was having trouble with the certain phases where it got very bullet hell like.
And there were a lot of projectiles on the screen.
47:31
And I thought, you know, I made the the strategic decision like, OK, I'm going to pick Anya because her special, she's invincible during her special and she like spins, like turns into a giant spinning dagger and like moves around like, OK, cool.
So that's 10 seconds of iframes that I can, I can, I can make use of.
47:49
So let me, you know, try that to get through the 1st wave of that bullet hell sequence.
And, and yeah, so, and then anyway, it ended up, it ended up working, but I, I similarly was in sort of this very intense situation where I had like bluffed all of my health and defenses.
48:06
So I was like completely just absorbed in like a mob of enemies at certain points and I just had my finger hovering over the special key.
So as soon as I dipped a little bit too low, I could jump into that that I frame sequence.
And yeah, anyway, the reason I bring it up is that just it goes to show that there's there's a lot of interesting and, you know, tactical gameplay decisions to be made.
48:32
It's a pretty surprisingly engaging game.
Do we know it's so there's plans for more characters?
Is there plans for more non character content?
More levels, more specials?
48:49
Or anything like that.
They usually add like a level every time they've add a a new update, so they're going to add another level.
They tease that they're going to do some sort of dungeon crawling thing when they get the next time, which not sure how it's going to work.
Might be a randomly generated dungeon situation.
49:05
Yeah, you.
Didn't want to go crazy with this one.
There's really no reason that this has to stick to a vampire survival clone or.
Like in the Hollow House, you see the the rabbit characters talking about how they're going to build the the a casino.
So that might be something that's going to happen too.
49:22
Right.
Yeah.
You mean this could end up just being a sprawling meta Hollow verse fan based?
Yeah, I mean, build your house, Stardew Valley, go to your, you know, the save some more fans, etcetera.
49:39
Indeed, and they can they can repay you by working for free your your holographic cabin.
So, well, interesting the possibility of like a dungeon crawl mode could address potentially address one of the issues I have with this game that's this has come up a number of times in vampire survivors.
50:00
I like how large the maps are and I like that there is an incentive to navigate and explore those maps, like to go find specific items or to go find new characters and things like that.
And I was kind of disappointed that such a thing didn't exist in this game.
And in fact, some of the levels are rather small and are are rather restrictive.
50:19
Now, fortunately, this is, pardon me, sort of made-up for the fact that, like, you don't necessarily have the leisure time to just just lollygag and wander around the level because you are being, you know, besieged by various Kawhi assailants and you need to be on your guard.
50:40
So it's not as big of an issue in this game than with something like Rotato.
But yeah, I was kind of surprised that there weren't there.
There wasn't much reason to be moving around.
Or maybe I'm off base with that.
Yeah.
There's.
50:55
Not a large scale movement.
I feel like I agree to some extent, but it does feel like in vampire Survivors it's I I was having a a case of Hans moment and no, that's too big.
You know, where, where it's like you, you see a lot of like the, the stage assets like tiled and kind of like repeated all over and like to some extent in some of them, the vampire survivors levels like it's warranted.
51:25
But in others, like, you know, in the, in the dairy plant, I'm like, Oh my God, like this, this thing, I'm getting trapped in this little corner again.
Come on.
Whereas I feel like I wanted when I was first playing through Holocaire, right off the heels of Vampire survivors, I wanted that.
I wanted like, where's the really big expanse of like, what am I supposed to do in this level?
51:44
And the more that I thought it was like, well, I feel like that's less of a focus in this because the, the character unlock system is outside the level and it's not, it's not so much like, Oh, you're going through the level to like find this thing.
It's more of like they're like, look at all like the, the front and centre like aspect of this game is the art assets.
52:05
And I feel like the, the like the enemy character sprites, your character sprites, like I can tell that that's where the the developers like putting all the energy.
And I think like it makes sense.
I think, you know, if the levels were like two to three times the size, I'm not sure that they would it would make the game better necessarily.
52:22
Although I will say the third stage is frighteningly small compared to the other ones, almost claustrophobically so.
But I think that helps in the sense of like, well, the character that I've been using, like, maybe isn't the best one to pick for this.
Like maybe I should pick a different character that might work better on this stage?
52:41
Yeah, that's a very good point, specifically about about Level 3.
But a different type of level, you know, facilitates a different type of game play for sure.
For sure.
Yeah.
It's, I don't know, a minor, a minor issue that I have, but I was like, surprised, like, oh, I'm not walking around the map like rescuing the fans from various locations.
53:03
But yeah, anyway, it's encouraging to hear about.
And again, it's it's it's, it's not an issue.
I think it's one of those things that perhaps I'm somewhat, you know, conditioned to expect it because like, Oh well, this game is vaguely, you know, informed by its, its four bearer vampire survivors.
53:20
So therefore it must be exactly like it, which obviously isn't the case.
I liked the maps for the most part.
I thought they're they're, they're a little bit more bespoke like the the Vampire Survivors maps.
I could not tell you if they're randomly generated or not because yeah, I, I literally don't know.
53:37
There's not anything interesting enough in them to warrant remembering, like layouts of things.
I thought the the the maps and this felt more thematic to what the game is going for.
I did have a little bit of a criticism of I found it very difficult to figure out when I was going to hit into objects.
53:59
Am I going to hit this chair or not?
Because if I do hit the chair and it stops me, I'm going to die.
And you know, sometimes you, you hit a, a wall and you not really realize it, it was a wall or a, or dead end corridor until it's too late.
54:16
So I'm not sure what the what the fix for that would be, but somehow maybe maybe like a wall assist mode has just hold your hand until you've memorized the levels.
Or if there were some some abilities that you know just allowed you to traverse the map in easier ways.
54:36
Or like if some character like character special abilities gave you more freedom of movement or something like that to avoid.
This is almost certainly going to be one of those things where immediately after saying this, I'm going to go look in the game.
There's going to be an option.
It's like show bright islands on on map for walls as it happened many times on this podcast.
54:57
Every time I complain about text in any game, it's always an option to make it different.
So hopefully there's not that.
Or maybe, hopefully there is that and I'm being an ass.
Well, you know, that's you should feel good that you're being validated in some way, but an option was added for the very reason you're bringing up.
55:16
Yeah, I also had that issue.
Colin, where?
Yeah, my, my hollow live idol superstar running around level 50, whatever.
You know, just like a unstoppable wall of death encircling her would suddenly be undone because like her, you know, foot got stuck on a loose plank of wood that was randomly in the left one.
55:42
I hadn't noticed.
No, I can't move.
That's it.
So, yeah, I, I, I hear you.
It wasn't happening so often that it was a huge, huge issue.
But it's not, it's not ideal.
That's that's for sure.
Mostly it was just the like one time that I actually lost because of it.
56:00
That's like, I thought this was AI, Didn't I didn't realize that this was a dead end that I can't get out of.
Andrew, tell us about the the trumpet.
Stamp the trumpet.
Stamp is a, I mean, to call it a milestone in game design would be a disservice to the ingenious nature of the trumpet stamp.
56:26
And of course, we've talked about how you can modify your, your weapons, modify your character by collecting different stamps.
And there are stamps that increase, you know, your attack speed, the amount of damage you're doing, the amount of healing you're doing, the possibility for like a random explosion to proc when you attack.
56:45
Now the trumpet, what it does is it changes.
It makes your attack dute, it makes a duding noise, creates a trumpet sound when you when you attack.
And normally you're collecting so many stamps that you're using them to upgrade other stamps.
57:04
And you can do that to, you know, of course, multiply the effects of, you know, more damage, more healing, etcetera, etcetera.
But if you do that on the trumpet, it just makes it louder.
And I maxed it out just for the meme, just for, for just for Fonzies.
57:21
And it was obviously mechanically useless, but boy was it fun.
And, and I think in some ways that kind of encapsulates the fun that is to be had in this game.
But not everything necessarily needs to make sense to you, the player.
57:40
But that doesn't make any less recreational any less fun any less delightful.
Oh, there's also a stamp that does something similar, except that it makes your attacks prettier and it boy, it does.
Yeah, nice rainbow effect going on.
That's.
That's it?
57:55
Asks you why are you updating, upgrading this?
Do you think there's gonna be more colors?
Yeah, we need, we need our our absolute St. of a solo dev to invent some new colors please, so that when you upgrade the stamp, we can get even more off the the color spectrum.
58:13
I just realized there was a huge oversight here where we didn't we didn't ask Danny who who is best girl.
Oh yeah.
Oh.
That's a fight.
I'm in danger putting him on the.
Spot.
OK.
Top top top five top ten top 20 How many who's your favorite top 100 and. 20 character to play in the game.
58:33
There we go.
That's a diplomatic way.
Right now I really like playing.
Was there a male the vampire girl because I found AI found out if I can like cheese her methods where she can just like stand still really and constantly heal and constantly attack and then heal and attack and heal and attack and it just becomes like it's just bats all over the screen killing everything without me having to do anything.
58:54
I got like really far in endless mode because I was basically standing still as she just kept eating everybody.
I'm like, oh, OK, good job, Mel.
That is outstanding.
Approximately what?
What?
How many minutes did you survive off of that very vampire type build?
59:13
Maybe 45 I think.
Nice, nice, nice.
Most impressive?
Another underrated aspect about Holocure compared to a lot of other survivor like games, online leaderboards, I don't think I've seen that in like any of the other ones, which I was kind of kind of jazzed about at first where I was like, Oh yeah, this is great.
59:33
But until I discovered the meta progression system, because I was like, oh, I'll be able to to see how how good mechanically I am compared to everyone else.
And then I realized, Oh yeah, but like, well, I'm not there yet because I got to, I got to unlock all of the, the weapon and speed and defense attack and all, all those, all that stuff 1st and then I can go back.
59:56
But I was kind of I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't a compare compare against your friends list option on the leaderboard.
So I think it's just like here's where you sit against the the entire Galaxy of other hollow cure players, which.
Like, yeah, I mean, that's like the standard way of of leaderboard doing it.
1:00:12
But like the first thing that I ever I always do whenever there's a leaderboard system is always going and comparing against all the other people on my scene list.
Like, all right, how much better is Andrew at this than me?
And I think the answer in this game is quite a bit, but I would I need that numerical distance counter in order to to be able to tell me exactly how far away I am from tying the score.
1:00:35
Scott, someday you have to go play some of the Zektronic games and Magnum Opus and look at their leaderboard system because I think you'll love it a lot.
Huh, different than points.
It's good.
Interesting.
Might.
Try to add that like when they first added the leaderboard it like crashed because they were like more people on it than they thought could ever be on it so they had to like really upgrade it to find the kids to happen.
1:01:00
Yeah, that's a.
That's a nice to have.
That would be fun and it seems like yeah, more more games like this should have a leaderboard system of some kind.
Just with a a few more settings would be would be a nice nice to have.
Well, cool.
1:01:17
Do we want to transition into rankings?
If that.
Special button.
Well wait, hold on, got to do the obligatory music session.
Oh, of course.
Oh my gosh, I don't even care.
That much about music, but I do feel like we have to talk about it in every game that we do because it's.
1:01:37
We're talking about a game populated by by idols, and we haven't talked about the music.
Shocking.
It's good.
Yeah, I think that like the the music in this game is like even just like the first stage, like the first stage, music is so important for any game.
1:01:55
And this game just like slam dunks it again with like such like a a jazzy upbeat fun, like ragtime like it's it's just it's so it sets the tone so well that like if you are this is a game that you don't want to play like on mute and listen to your favorite rogue like podcast because you're missing out on those on like the amazing tunes and like again, like admittedly.
1:02:21
And the trumpet.
Yeah, and and the trumpet and yeah, like even even like all the other stages have just such fun and interesting soundtracks to them that yeah, like, I mean, it's just like the sound design in this game in general.
Is is.
Spectacular.
1:02:37
I'll say that the the music wasn't necessarily for me, but it is very catchy.
Like I have it just just I thought about oh, the word music and then the the the song just started playing in my head.
I'm like, oh, good.
Like I can't not play it immediately.
1:02:55
So that's it is it is praise for sure.
If if the song's good enough to just get stuck in your head no matter what, like it.
It's very catchy and it very, very much fits the theme, which I appreciate.
1:03:11
It it the the music are chip tune versions of actual song is sung by the girls in different areas.
So Oh yeah, that's perfect.
They they want them to be catchy.
Oh, that's that's like such a that's such a great like a a trick is not quite the right word, but like you already it it everything, everything in this game is like, hey, we already have all of the the content is just there.
1:03:39
You pull the characters like you're not inventing anything.
You're bringing it into the game and implementing it.
It's like the songs already exist.
The the people already exist.
You're just making pixelated versions and eight bit versions of all the things and putting them in the game.
1:03:58
Sure, it's like how can you go wrong when you're pulling from this hopper of like already established and tested things, Especially with the music, it's like, well, they're sure to be bangers cuz we already got this playlist set up.
That being said, the the work of taking the characters and like finding a way to make their gimmicks and their like specific theme like fun and engaging takes a talented game designer.
1:04:22
So no, no, I'm not.
Yeah, I don't mean to make light of the the actual work that would go into all of this.
Even just making 8 bit versions of a song that exists is really hard because I just I just.
Wanted to make it clear 'cause we have a track record on this podcast of of really loving solo devs.
1:04:43
Yeah, I wanna make sure I feel like you get a, you get a, a, a sticker for sure.
Because you're, if you're a solo dev making a game for free out of love, you get a pass on pretty much everything for a long time.
1:04:59
Like, oh, you're not creating stuff from scratch.
It's like it's not supposed to be graded from scratch.
You're it's a labor of love.
And that's what's showing here.
And yeah.
Indeed, indeed.
Here on the Grog pod we say I have a saying which is all all devs go to heaven and this particular dev goes to double platinum hard mode, night mode.
1:05:23
Yeah, got you, Evan.
Indeed, indeed.
Good tracks.
And it should be noted that the Halloween level has a sort of spoopy beat to it as well.
Outstanding.
Multi Bandit.
It's a it's a Halloween song, so it's not chopped.
1:05:40
Makes sense.
What was the alligator thing I know you guys mentioned?
It before and then the mascot for Amelia the Investigator.
It's called the Investigator.
I see.
She drew it herself.
Alligator Sleuth.
1:05:56
Nailed it.
Oh, I was.
Yeah, I'm even thinking of.
I might not be thinking of the right person, but I was.
Also if you have player character and you have her dog out, if you press P next to the dog you can pet the dog the achievement as well.
That's good.
1:06:14
That's I mean, I feel like that's all games.
You have to be able to pet the dog.
I'm glad that I'm glad that made it in.
People are like, we pet the dog and he's like, yes.
We can make that happen.
Yeah.
And went to go research one of one of these V tubers, I think it was it was Watson Amelia.
1:06:36
And I was like surprised to see like the first video I found was like her playing counter strike.
And I was like, all right, respect God, solve that mystery is the bomb.
It's that A or B?
Which one is?
All the girls have their strange games that good at like Squeeze is terrifyingly good at Tetris.
1:06:54
Like, terrifyingly good.
Terrifying.
I mean, if you're streaming all day, I feel like you end up playing a variety of games and doing a variety of things on your stream because like, I don't know, if you're playing the same game all day every day, it would get boring.
1:07:10
A wide variety of things to to play and to do and whatnot.
With some.
They all play variety, some have games, they play comfort games.
Yeah, All right.
Now we can do scores.
And now, yeah, Andrew, why don't you, why don't you kick us off with ratings here?
1:07:30
Well, let's see here.
I ended up sinking quite a bit of time into this game and having a pretty darn positive time throughout, despite part of that gameplay time being kind of stuck in this almost fever dream loop of just playing the second level over and over again and trying to optimize my movement and not have any like actual spat upgrades.
1:07:54
So it's that's to the game's credit, that's I was playing it with with a fever and still enjoying myself.
Let's see.
It's kind of tricky to to write this game 'cause like it's really good and it's really good, but like how, how much do you take into account like the fact that it's like free and it's like what was that like necessarily make it better than it came to cost more money, etcetera, etcetera.
1:08:23
Hollow Cure is coming in on my list at #11 So almost cracked the top 10.
It is a quality game, and even if you're not steeped in the lore of Hollow Live and V Tubers and all that stuff, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
1:08:44
Yeah, go on next.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10.
It is dead center in the middle of all of my rankings.
I, I, I feel like I'm, I'm a little bit of two minds of this.
I don't, it definitely wasn't.
1:09:00
It's not a game that is made for me.
Like I'm not part of the scene.
I don't know the references and I feel like that does hurt my enjoyment of it a little bit.
However, it is a pretty fun game and I want things like this to exist.
1:09:19
I don't care that it's not for me in some in in some ways, like I want, I want people to have things that they love in video game form.
So that gives it like it it, it detracts because it's not for me.
1:09:36
But it's you get those points back because it's very, very much for someone.
And I want I want everyone to have that that something.
So, but yeah, if, if, if you're into V tubers in any way, shape or form, you should actually play this game.
1:09:54
Like absolutely, go do it.
You have been on YouTube, you should check out this game.
If you've heard of YouTube.
If you've been meeting, if it's on your To Do List to check out this site, check out this game.
Yeah, I guess I'll go next.
1:10:10
We'll save our our special guest for last year.
Yeah, I think like I'm kind of in a similar mindset.
For me, it's a it's a 7.3, whatever that means.
It doesn't really mean anything, but it's a it's a good meaty chunk of of the curve for my rankings ties with Streets of Rogue and just ahead of Warsim, which I think are like equally, equally weird, like solo dev efforts of like like lots of charm and like interesting stuff going on.
1:10:42
Yeah, I think like the the hollow cure scene is like, I'm glad that we covered this game because I feel like it's not a scene that I would go out of my way to really like investigate more of.
But the more that I think about like, well, like a lot of people that I follow on YouTube like are V tubers to some degree.
1:11:00
So like what, like exploring this world of the Internet has been very interesting and rewarding for me.
So I think like this game in general, like really fun.
Hey, it's free.
So what excuse do you have on that front?
You know, the the amount of like quality production that's gone into it as a free product is kind of mind boggling.
1:11:21
I think the, my biggest criticism is just maybe like the level design is kind of like, I don't know, but I'm sure if I put more time into it, I would see how the different characters perform in different scenarios for, for that kind of stage.
1:11:37
I'm, I'm very interested to see what more they add to it.
I think that like, yeah, if they add like a dungeon crawler bit to it, then this game is already better than Cult of the Lamb because it has a better, better farming management system than it.
Yeah, I think it's, it's definitely super interesting that it has a very unique upbeat aesthetic.
1:11:58
Art design is top of the line.
Yeah.
And it's it's just has such a fun vibe to it.
But yeah, so that's going to kick this over to to Danny.
Now, Danny, as this being your only game that you've reviewed with us on the podcast so far, it is simultaneously your number one and lowest ranked game.
1:12:17
So So what are some other games that you would suggest like that you like as much as Hollow Cure, rogue like or otherwise?
And also you can just tell us why you like this.
Game.
Yes, that's also true.
Obviously, I like this game largely because I do get all the references.
1:12:34
I get the jokes and I, I, I witnessed most of the memes that they reference randomly throughout the entire game and I'm like, oh, I was there when that happened kind of situation.
It's challenging and also rewarding and when you actually play it right and do it right.
And the creator of the game is paying attention to the people who play it.
1:12:53
And like people ask for something, they're like they try to implement it if they can, especially if the the girls are the ones who asked for it, because they will like actively do things that the girls playing the game will like, Hey, you should do this.
But so on that point, I think it's clear this person loves making this game and that pours out real hard.
1:13:14
So for me, it's like really good, really on top of the games I love to play.
So I I have to give it like a maybe a nine out of 10 just because I want all the people in there already like give me every single character too many.
Yeah, there's.
Been waiting for the update.
1:13:30
Where overload is is good.
Like I want the full buffet.
Yeah, hoping the update like they they put the update off because they wanted, they said they got overworked on it and so they made their other game The hollow Break and I'm like the next two generations are the ones with my favorite character and give it to me.
1:13:52
He's keep it just out of reach.
Yeah, people are worried that he wasn't going to add the character, but they've said I'm going to add the character.
There's some contract issues.
The reason why he's not sponsored by Hollow Live because if he was, there's characters he wouldn't be allowed to put in the game even though they are Hollow Live girls.
1:14:12
Yeah, that makes.
Sense some have been terminated or have retired and it makes them not.
Yeah, once you start adding money and everything gets a little bit trickier.
Yeah.
So he's like, I can put all the girls in regardless, even the ones that were fired.
1:14:29
That's that's a good option.
Yeah.
When it's a free game, you have free reign to do a lot of things, including including include folks that are going.
It just occurred to me that a hollow break, it's right in the name.
He's taking a break from the other, from the development of the other game.
1:14:45
So obvious genius.
So we kind of discussed other games similar to, I mean, we discussed a lot of games for.
Some of this.
But what do you got for?
For our for our similar games segment here, I kind of broke it out into three chunks.
I mean, obviously, you know this, this game is the most similar to Vampire Survivors, so we got to put that at the top of the list.
1:15:04
But a couple other ones that I thought were like yes, Vampire Survivor like, but also like in the animes sphere, there's one called Replic REPLLIK survivors, which almost looks like you're you're playing like a survivors like game as as AV tuber to some degree.
1:15:29
And then another one is is called gotcha fever, which I believe you know, still kind of hits that same kind of anime aesthetic.
There's some other anime rogue like games out there that are less on the on the survivor end of the spectrum, but I I still want to include them because of their similar aesthetic style.
1:15:50
So you got a recently released highly rated game, a rabbit and steel, which I believe is like a kind of like a a Co-op.
I I believe it was like, it was described as like doing like a Co-op MMO raid, which seemed interesting.
1:16:05
It seemed like a very unique approach.
There is Marfusha Sentinel girls.
We got a couple to who games in here to who hero of ice fairy and to who unconnected marketeers and I guess also to some degree anime rogue like now see our previous episode one way heroics for for some GB animation style on top of that.
1:16:33
But yeah, that's that those are those are some among, you know, the the bottomless pit of of survivor like games that have come out.
You can listen to our survivors Vampire Survivors episode for more recommendations on that one specifically.
But yeah, those are some more that are kind of geared toward the anime end of the spectrum.
1:16:51
But yeah, that'll wind us down here.
We we have Well, yeah, I guess let's see what order do I want to do some of these bullet points in the Google sheet in I guess, yeah.
So right into the show, grogpodzone@gmail.com Mastodon, Grogpod at game dev dot place and our website with all of our rankings and other apocrypha Grogpod dot zone.
1:17:14
All right, all that's out of the way, Danny, your time to shine.
You have a platform.
What do you What do you want to?
What do you want to?

1:18:33
That's that's come in.
So if you remember the e-mail that I said a few minutes ago, Grog PUD zone@gmail.com, send in or wherever you're listening to this right now.
There's likely a comment box below.
Type into that thing.
This is what what video game music you guys should listen to and what we're planning on doing for our summer break episode is here's here's music we we kind of talked about in this episode.
1:18:59
You know, music is an an important part of video games.
A lot of games that we've covered or plan to cover have really banging soundtracks to them.
And I think it's time that, you know, we, we take a break for one episode from from playing games and yeah, see how well we can test that YouTube content ID algorithm with, with playing some, some summer jams.
1:19:24
So we're going to have a summer jam sesh for our next episode.
Danny, do you have any, any games that come to mind of like this?
This game has got a killer soundtrack you guys got to listen to.
Honestly for weirdly enough Stardew Valley has one of the most relaxing soundtracks.
Awesome call.
1:19:41
A good call I'm looking forward to.
Solo dev extravaganza.
Oh yeah, that's true.
Starky Valley iconic sole dev endeavor.
