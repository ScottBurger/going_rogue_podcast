Welcome all to the hellish high temperatures of summer rogue likes and the show that looks at all rogue like games or rogue like games old emphasis on the old this time or new or modern remasters of them.
Welcome.
0:50
I'm Scott Berger, the head of this podcast, and I think we can work together and resolve this episode in a way that benefits us both.
And with me are my Co hosts who are rake, brutal and without mercy.
1:06
Hey, it's me, Andrew.
I'm Andrew Rippon.
Tear Harshman.
It's good to be here.
And I'm calling a fiendish devil from the underworld who's come to your world to shoot a fireball in your face and disagree.
1:22
We're just we're, we're too excited.
We're too excited to jump into our our big 5 O 50th game that we've from 50 and 51st games that we've reviewed here on said Grog Pod 'cause this is a double barrelled double feature of Doom RL, Doom the Rogue Lake and it's modern remastered by the same developer Jupiter Hell.
1:47
Let's let's let's jump into this.
I think yeah.
So what what we're gonna do this is another combined episode here.
We'll jump into some stats about Doom RLS and back and forth about it.
And then we'll jump into some stats about Jupiter Hell back and forth on that and we'll probably cross compare along the way here.
2:02
But Doom RL released our oldest episode to date.
I don't know if I have an exact date here.
Someone will correct me in the comments below.
Somewhere around 2003.
The game is now 21 years old and old enough to go out and and gotten share a beer with your favorite Dumaro.
2:24
Dumaro can only be found on PC for reasons we'll come to in a minute, and it was made and developed by Cornell Iselovich from Roclaw, Poland, who is known for his work on Dumaro, Diablo, RL, Aliens, RL, and Berserk Exclamation Mark, all grand pappies of the traditional ASCII rogue like genre, and I'll lump Jupiter Hell in here as well.
2:54
And it's worth pointing out that Dumarel shares some DNA with another famed rogue game developer, Derek Yu, who developed the tile set for Dumarel.
You might know him from the creator of a little game known as Spelunky, and I think he also did the work for for desktop dungeons as well.
3:15
But dumarl being a not on steam and B just kind of self published on the developer's website.
It's kind of hard to to put into a bucket of like just how popular this is question mark.
But if the if the 150,000 plus downloads off of the chaos forge website are to be believed and if we do some kind of hand WAVY math about well like you can approximate how many steam reviews there are based on sales and blah blah blah.
3:46
If we say that like 2% ish of people who have downloaded that game would have given a steam review then Dumarel would shockingly show up on our our steam data set as maybe the 232nd most popular rogue game in our data.
4:05
Just kind of baffling.
Andrew in the First Age in the first battle when the shadows first lengthened.
One sentence described what you do in the traditional rogue like Dumarl.
4:23
Well, Scott, thank you for asking.
That's what the sentence shoot, I already screwed it up.
No.
Just turn the podcast off now.
Are a Marine who exists in space and you are tasked with.
4:43
All right, look, I skipped the splash screen, but the gameplay the the the intro text, I skipped it.
So sorry.
You are a guy in the Doom universe and it is up to you to become, to gain the condition, to get knee deep in the dead by means of myrtlerizing zombies and sci-fi ghouls and demons, and to rip and tear your way through a procedurally generated dungeon in a grid based manner with a high level of procedural generation.
5:23
Is this sounding?
Is this sounding potentially recognizable as something that's very rogue like?
This is firmly in the rogue like genre.
No light about it.
Light be gone you're you're you're you're rogue precisely.
5:44
This has got to be one of the roguiest games that we've played.
I.
Think it's probably the roguiest game we've played since like Cog mind.
Yeah, yeah, I think there's a lot of shared, well, you can see where the DNAI think of modern.
It feels weird to say modern traditional rogue likes, but I think we have to in order to be extremely specific 'cause yeah, games like Cog Mind or Tales of Mahjal or all the other ones that we've done do have do share all of this same DNA of being like the tile based grid base permadeath RPG.
6:23
But it's it's worth kind of dialing the clock back a little bit to 2003 to just kind of figure out where like, where is this game coming from exactly?
Because like the oldest game that we've played to date, as I frantically type into the microphone here, oldest game that we've played to date has been Tales of Maggia, which came out seven years after Doom RL debuted.
6:49
And and and even then that's like in its, you know, extreme early release version.
Like we wouldn't see Binding of Isaac or FTL for like 2011 2012 so a long ways out.
And in this world of 2003, like the reigning idea of what a a rogue like was was net hack.
7:12
Which I don't know.
I don't think that's like within our real house really to cover because I'm not sure if any of us have the patience or or like the mental stamina to handle something is as beastly as an ASCII only game With every with more is more is the motto for net hack I think.
7:34
I can handle the the ASCII but I don't know if I can handle the the the systems.
Right, exactly.
And the systems I think is like, is what underscores early 2000s rogue likes is, you know, you have like asking, it's like, oh, great, we don't have to worry about all these like lousy graphics and user interfaces and all this stuff holding us back.
7:56
That means we can input stuff like having your, your luck meter based on the phase of the moon and that stuff.
So and so it's, it is kind of, you know, not outlandish to say that Dumarl was was pretty revolutionary at the time.
8:17
Welcome to the to the rogue like history corner where we talk all about the history.
So Dumarl comes in and instead of having like systems on systems on systems and 50 plus hours of runs and you know, you can, you can have your game go on for weeks and weeks.
8:36
This is kind of starting the whole aspect of less is more for rogue likes and the idea of coffee break rogue likes and things that you can kind of finish in, well, you know, depending on how long your coffee break is at work in afternoon or I think for me, it took me about 90 minutes to beat it.
8:54
But yeah, I think one of the the major revolutionary things about this game is it's short and sweet and in your face and really, like, I'm, I'm kind of jumping ahead a little bit here, but you know, the first level you booted up with, you are greeted with the titular Doom experience of the E1M1 soundtrack, which I mean, maybe more rogue likes need need Doom music, but that really just kind of sets the tone for what this game is all about.
9:29
It it certainly does.
It nails absolutely beautifully.
Like nails the doom experience, despite being a radically, you know, different genre.
It's it's, it's pretty impressive.
And Andrew, like, so growing up, you know, so I guess some people will be downloading this episode be like, oh, I remember playing Doom RL in college and everything.
9:52
And I think, you know, this, this game came out for us in probably like early high school or something.
But when, when we were growing up, right, we Doom was kind of like right on the early cusp of all of our gaming experiences, if if available.
10:10
And I remember, you know, installing the 93 Doom on like 10 floppy disks or something and being like, yeah, this, this is pretty rad.
And using only keyboard controls to run around and FPS things.
I think I was, I wound up being more of a Quake head growing up.
10:25
But Andrew, I think you're probably, you're probably more into the Doom scene 'cause I feel like you're, you're more familiar with like modern Doom modding and such.
A a little bit, a little bit.
The first FPS that I spent a lot of time with was Duke Nukem, which was, I mean, quite a noticeable departure from from Doom in a lot of ways.
10:52
And the last 2.5 D Doom game I played was Doom 64, which was conveniently ported to Steam like that a few years ago.
It is interesting.
11:09
It's interesting to see that, you know, like it's the staying power that the Doom engine and the GZ Doom engine, which is for those who don't know, like a highly modified version, pretty heavily modified version of the original engine.
11:26
But nonetheless, still, I mean, you know, it can be it's it's still based on that original thing.
And so much so that like the the GZ Doom is being used for a lot of like, you know, modern indie games, which is very impressive.
11:42
And the love of wizardry and everything that's that's being done with it is pretty cool, pretty cool, pretty outstanding.
And my, my memories of playing Doom when I was younger, it was mostly just, you know, yeah, the, the first episode, like the shareware version, which I'm sure is a, you know, practically near universal experience for a lot of gamers of our age.
12:06
When did you guys get your first computer?
How old were you?
Like Doom came out before I had a computer.
Gosh, I feel like the first like real computer that we had was like a compact presario, which was like, I think just barely able to play Doom and Quake at the time.
12:27
I don't remember if that required.
I don't remember if if Quake required like a graphics card or what, but I think, yeah, that was like, that was like cutting edge tech at the time.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Windows 95?
What was before Windows 95 Windows.
I think 93.
12:43
When when did that come out?
No.
What?
I I'm thinking, yeah, that's probably around the era that.
I got OK, I'm looking at windows.
I don't think I had anything before 1995.
So I I don't think I've ever played the original doom.
13:01
It came out before we had a computer and also is not the kind of game that my parents would have let me buy like just off of the theme alone.
Like my parents were not like particularly restrictive about games, but like blast man fight hell demons is like, OK, that's a little bit like blatantly demon stuff.
13:29
Yeah, I guess I was like growing up playing like Mortal Kombat 2, Doom and Quake and that turning out to be a a relatively well adjusted human being.
I think like, OK, maybe those Senate hearings actually didn't have any teeth to them, but.
We were a Nintendo household.
13:47
Well, you could have played it on North 64.
There you go.
What, What always gave me a kick was growing up and hearing about kids in school weren't allowed to play the Diablo series because, oh, they're Christian, you know, families.
So that it was against God.
And it's like, and me as a kid being like, I mean, come on, you're, you're fighting the devils.
14:08
Obviously it's a good game.
Obviously it's good for you.
I remember distinctly like getting, yeah, I got a copy of Duke Nukem for my birthday and I was playing the heck out of it.
I'd, I'd like take the, the manual to like school and like, read it and whatnot.
And one time I was sitting outside of my piano teacher's house while one of my siblings was, was having their lesson and my dad's in the car with me.
14:34
And he's like, hey, son, let me, let me take a look at that.
And like, it's extremely detailed and like gives you information on like all the enemies, all the power ups, all the stuff.
And so he's like flipping through it and like seeing like all these guns, all these different weapons, the power ups, like, oh, one of them is, is like steroids, like, Oh yeah, you know, that's.
14:53
Steroid use when you get the chainsaw.
Yeah, and then like it also it's talking about how there's oh, these are the the the sex workers in the game and how Duke Nukem.
Hey.
You know you're he's a little.
R&R and all this stuff.
You're tipping them very well in that game, I will say.
15:09
Very well.
And then my dad finishes flipping through this and he goes, son, I think when it comes to the video games you play, let's let's make sure this is the, the most mature one that you play.
Let's not go any further than this.
And I'm thinking like, oh, bingo.
15:26
Well, this is like the worst that it gets.
So it couldn't be we've we've already reached the, the maximum.
So I had kind of the the opposite issue.
Taking Leisure Suit Larry off of your your Christmas wish list at that point, Yeah, I think.
But anyway, yeah, this this game, yeah, Doom, Doom RL.
15:45
There is my understanding there is a Duke Nukem RL as well.
Of course, I mean, that's that's kind of the expectation is like if ASCII then apply kind of any sort of IP you can to it 'cause then, well, you don't have to worry about any sort of graphic stuff.
16:01
So, you know, there you go.
Yeah, I think like Dumarl is is very interesting because if you find you can hunt for YouTube videos from ages ago where it's only ASCII, but it's the same game.
It's the same game as the one that you can go download now, assuming that the network config file line is is doesn't need to be edited and you can actually run it.
16:29
And when you boot it up, you are greeted with this amazing splash art of the the titular doom marine muscles bulging, fighting off a demon.
It looks it looks really good and it really sets the tone of like you're in a doom ass doom game front like and that you can tell was really like, you know, God was was 1993 like just 10 years before 2003.
16:55
I know that that's what the math says, but that doesn't feel right.
It was a lot of it was a lot of years of our lives.
That's, I mean, you know, I was what, five in 1993?
So that was 3222 lifetimes.
After it's a great time to to start smashing some Imps and even just maneuvering around the menu for the like this main menu, the like the sound design here is so good.
17:22
I think this is one of the things I I like the most about this game is sound design is so good and chunky where like you're moving from like new game to like options.
It just has this super satisfying doom style and funk that like Oh yes, this is I'm I'm I'm in like 3 seconds after editing the config file I am in and you are greeted with quite the text crawl at the start.
17:48
Well like also I guess to be clear before you even you even get to the story part Andrew, are classes normal for Doom games?
Not generally, Scott, That's wild.
Wow.
Right.
Yeah.
Right out of the gate, you're getting some unique, interesting stuff, which again, you might feel like, oh, no, this is this is such a different genre, this can't possibly be doomed.
18:12
But you know, they managed to make it work.
Yeah.
So you you're presented when you start a new game with an option for a a few different, I think 3 different classes.
You have your your standard marine class, get your scout class and your technician class and your marine class is kind of what you expect.
18:31
It's just beefy run and gun shoot, take lots of damage kind of stuff.
Scout is more kind of swift tactical speed dodging.
Technician is your nerd class for constructing weapons with this quite, quite interesting assembly system that we'll get to in a minute.
18:51
But each of these classes has different traits associated with them.
You have kind of like your standard stuff at the beginning of like, you know, this, this trait gives you more health or this trait gives you more accuracy or things like that.
But there's some that are more that are locked in specific to the the main class that you pick.
19:13
So for example, if you pick the marine class, you'll have access to the vampire master trait or if you pick the technician one, there's one that I think that allows you to like disassemble weapons and take take mods back that you had.
19:32
Yeah, you can destroy weapons and receive a random mod out of them.
But anyway, like it gives you a lot of good RPG stuff to think about, but it's not overwhelming with like, Oh my God, there's like a Path of Exile style upgrade tree of zillions of options here and each one has plus point 1% new damage and things like that.
19:55
I think it's actually pretty well balanced and straightforward.
But if you're like me and you're just firing up this game, you're like, yes, give me the Marine experience.
Jump on in.
You are greeted with this almost Terminator style red text on black background.
The story start where you are.
20:16
You are the the titular Doom Marine around Mars and you're, you're coming back from a a a, a, a long patrol and you know you, you don't know what to do with yourself.
You lean back near the com console and listen for news from your fellow Marines and then you hear screams over over the I guess the text Oh God, no, there's some way.
20:38
There are gunshots, more gunshots.
This can't be happening.
Help, help.
I'm splat.
Jake, where are you?
What's Oh fuck.
Bang Bang, bang, slurp, silence and then bam, you're in.
It is E1M1 ING all over.
You are running around on the surface of Mars with a, a couple Mars plants nearby.
20:59
And that's, that's the start.
You are in Doom.
You are pistoling down former humans, getting shotguns and going from procedurally generated level to level.
I think there's something like 25 levels or floors of this to go and fight hell itself at the at the very end.
21:21
And for each one of these levels, you have your, your very standard rogue, very standard traditional classic rogue style of kind of a maze.
But in this case, I think it's, it's a lot more dialed down.
It's not quite the volume that you have for like a cog mind level.
21:41
It's much more restrained.
And like on gosh, gosh, I don't know, like AA1440P monitor, like the whole level just fits right in it.
And you can kind of see everything all in one go.
And you got exploding fire barrels, acid barrels, you have your your former humans, you have your sergeants, you got shotguns, demons, Imps.
22:05
All of the Doom 1993 trappings are there except, you know, maybe minus red and blue key cards.
And you're running and gunning.
And you have to choose on each one of these levels if you want to continue down a normal level or go on to one of these demonic side branches where the side branches are interesting because they, they offer, it's a risk reward level that you have your normal, your, your normal Mars base infested with zombies and, and held demons.
22:39
And then you have your hell level infested with zombies and hell demons.
But like the second level, for example, your option is well, like do you want to continue with the normal one or do you want to go to Hell's Arena like?
Blood, blood.
Blood.
Blood.
Take me in, take me.
In is what the text says when you first arrive, complete with like a demonic, you know, and now it's like are you foolish, mortal, you dare, etcetera, etcetera.
23:05
Very fun, very fun.
How many rounds did you, what did you do in the Hell Arena, Scott?
So the.
Scott Scott is the most accomplished Dumarl player.
Here, well I mean accomplished in that I've only beaten the Cyber Demon twice and then summarily got my face smashed in on the 1st hell level both times.
23:29
Also on easy mode, which again, I'm I'm appreciative of Dumarl having an easy mode to begin with.
You have all of your standard I'm too young to die and hurt me Plenty modes from 93 doomed.
But yeah, I thought this was kind of funny.
Like your first side branch level, which in traditional rogue likes, you know, you you have your main kind of branch and your your side branches again, a very kind of cog Mindy aspect where those would be going like deeper and deeper down and have like a various theme to it.
23:59
I'm like, oh, I guess there's just yeah, some hell announcer and like for the second level.
OK, this is all right.
Let's try it.
And Hell's Arena, it's just like a standard rogue like arena.
24:14
You're blasting monsters and cacademons and I think there's three, there's three or four rounds and you have the option to stop at any time if it's it's getting too hot for you.
But if you complete all of the the challenges, you get more rewards.
24:29
You get chain guns, you get rocket launchers, you get more booster pack kind of things associated with it.
Obviously each round is harder than the previous one, but it does give you like a again, I'm going to keep coming back to cog mine.
I think cog mine took a lot of inspiration here.
It gives you a lot of good gear up front to get you started on a good run.
24:49
If you're like, yeah, I'm I'm a pro.
I know how to like bait these monsters and demons around and a lot of a lot of the side branch demon levels are kind of like this where you'll have like more and more escalations of of challenge and more risk reward and, you know, a really nice plasma rifle waiting for you at the end of the of the military base, for example, or you know, something nice.
25:16
Wait, yeah, I think like the BFG 9000 can only be found in one of these in the spiders layer or something like that.
And like those things are like worth seeking out because they will make short work of many bosses in this game, which another aspect I really, really like in Doomaral is the so I talked a little bit about the sound before.
25:38
There's a, a big emphasis on sound and sound direction here where you're walking through one of the dungeons and you'll hear like one of these.
The like the, the, the imp sounds from 93 doom.
I do appreciate that it is like the same one and it has like this kind of janky like MIDI clipped like sound to it.
25:57
We're like you'll hear it like coming just in out of vision.
We'll go.
And it's it just has like that, that perfect almost B movie style production value to it, where it's like if it was more polished, I feel like it would almost be taking away from the experience, but it does.
26:16
It's so bad.
It's good.
It's wrapped around but it's I guess.
It's not even really bad per SE.
It's more charming in its dated application maybe, which is fine.
Like, you know, it's a a 21 year old game we're talking about here.
26:32
So enemies will like you, you'll be, you know, playing this.
And I'm using my headphones to figure out, OK, I know they're behind this door and they're walking away from the door so I can go in now and blast them.
Like there's a a bit like a shockingly huge emphasis on on sound and using sound to your advantages.
26:52
You're maneuvering through here, which I really appreciated.
And for the boss levels, I thought this was particularly great because you'll come to a boss level and you'll the music a will be just so on point.
This like really like Blamin guitar music.
27:10
I'm like, OK, I'm surrounded by health packs.
I know this is a boss fight coming up and you'll just hear this like thump, thump, thump, like in the distance coming towards you.
Like oh shit, Oh shit, Oh shit.
And then like 2 like Barons of hell will come out and they'll just be like shooting rockets at you and you're like, OK, let's, let's do this dance.
27:31
And it, it feels so much more cinematic and, and cool of an experience than you would think you would get from just like, you know, watching, watching someone play it.
It's really something that when you jump in and you're like dancing around them and shooting rockets and baiting them around it and like the it's just it's such a a good experience that I never thought I would go in having that with just even on easy mode with run and gun, you know, very light decision making.
28:05
Andrew, did you have a a chance to fumble around with the the assemblies or the way that you mod weapons in this game?
Interesting.
No, I did not when this.
28:22
Is.
Yeah, let's talk about the gear, because perhaps I was not exploring a a whole element of the loot.
Which I can't, I can't blame you because it took me, I think, I don't know, I put, I put maybe like 10 or 11 hours into Dumaro over since our last episode.
28:39
And again, like a lot more time than I thought I was gonna put into it and I totally missed on and this whole aspect of the game almost like with dodging as well, but but there's like a ton of weapons just kind of floating around.
You're like, why would I want to pick up like 6 pistols here?
28:56
What's the deal?
There's the way that you mod weapons and do Morel is you pick up mod packs which like a a a bulk pack will have some kind of effect on like the weapons capacity or a Power Pack will make it shoot harder or something.
29:13
But there's combinations of these that when you apply them to a weapon, will turn a normal rocket launcher into a a tactical rocket launcher, a mini rocket launcher, something like that shoots faster.
Oh, swap.
There are.
Some of that kind of thing, synergy sort of things.
29:29
There are synergies, but I think one thing that kind of detracts from this is that so there's three different mods you can apply booster or no, It's like bulk tactical and Power or something like that.
And I thought, Oh well, surely I can apply any number of these in any combination to any weapon, right?
29:50
Wrong.
There is a like, I don't know why the restriction is here, but like you can't, for example, put two power packs on some weapons.
And I feel like that's that's like weirdly limiting in a sense again, like, you know, it's in a free open source game.
30:07
Maybe I could go and like put in the merge request myself if I really cared, but but it feels like that's that's something that would be interesting to explore to give the game.
I mean, there's already plenty of these kind of options available, but I just thought it was sort of baffling that like some of them can't be combined, but another, another aspect that I, I told you.
30:26
Looking at the wiki, some of them.
You can put two power.
Packs on true.
Some of them, but not all of them.
But not all of them.
Yeah, which I'm sure there's, you know, there's, you know, reasons 20 years ago why that was the case.
Andrew, you posted something in the group chat about dodging and I was like, huh, What?
30:44
There's dodging.
Yeah, well, it occurred to me like, and to be clear, like I, I played Doom RL like, I don't know, 10 years ago or something and like just kind of goofed around with it for a little bit and I was like, wow, that was really neat.
31:05
Maybe I should put some more time into it.
But I didn't for whatever reason.
And then interestingly or ironically, I guess ended up gravitating towards an Aliens based one, which as in like the 20th Century Fox property, which is all ASCII.
31:24
There's there, at least at the time that I played it just because of the, the, the subject matter, I guess, which is a very similar game anyway, right.
So I was playing so when I played it back in the day, I absolutely did not pick up on this, but it just occurred to me while playing it this time around, you start in the first level, it's big sort of open area.
31:49
There's not any like cover or anything to be spoken of.
And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, I mean, this is such a faithful adaptation of Doom, surely there has to be some strafing involved.
Any FPS experience you got a strafe in order to avoid taking up too much damage?
32:04
And much to my delight, I, I, I, you know, looked into it online and sure enough, if you move in a perpendicular fashion to your your enemy, you get a bonus to avoid taking damage.
Which is, hey, what a what a great adaptation of mechanics from 1 wildly different genre into another.
32:27
Yeah.
And I, I want to say that like it, it makes a lot more sense in retrospect as opposed to me like running like parallel away from the enemy as they're shooting in a line at me.
I'm like, why am I taking so much damage?
Particularly with the cyber demon fight where he's shooting rockets at you and you're like dancing back and forth to avoid them.
32:48
Or in my case, running right up to him and trying to like double barrel shotgun blast him while he's like techno slashing me at the same time.
I'm like, all right, one of us is gonna die first.
Techno slash, you know, Yeah.
But yeah, like, yeah, I think there's there's a deceptively deep amount of of content and strategy in a game that just kind of on the face of it looks like a, you know, something that you could easily cast aside.
33:20
And yeah, I was I was very surprised at how much depth there was to a a really old game.
But you can kind of tell where where it's legacy has come from and how it's how it's sort of impacted everything down the line.
All right, we've, we've talked some about Jupiter Hell or Nope, other way around Doom RL and it's worth transitioning to our, to our other game Jupiter Hell.
33:45
We'll, we'll probably also still talk back and forth about them.
But Jupiter hell was, was started from a Kickstarter that the developer put out and the Kickstarter started, started getting traction.
34:02
And I don't know if it was because of the Kickstarter or just happened to be bad timing, but Zenimax, who owned the the the Doom IP license at the time, sent a cease and desist to our unfortunate developer saying you got to take down anything having to do with Doom.
34:22
I don't think it was because of the Kickstarter, I think it was because they were put that was the year that Doom, that the new remake of Doom came out.
So I'm guessing that they're like scouring the Internet trying to kill all Doom related things that weren't Doom 20. 16 So that's true.
34:37
Yeah, that would make sense.
And it almost kind of created like a Streisand effect where the the Kickstarter was like it was, it was getting there, but they weren't sure if it was going to get over the line funding wise.
And then all of a sudden you have this like hero moment of like big bad IP lawyers are coming to knock down the little guy.
34:58
We got to go and support them.
And then I think that got them over the line and got them pretty well funded as a result of it.
So, and, and if you go to the Doom RL Chaos forge website, you'll see everything is branded D asterisk, asterisk, asterisk RL or DRL.
35:15
So you might see like Doom RL abbreviated as DRL as as a way to kind of placate the, the auto lawyer attacks.
But but yeah, for all intents and purposes, everything in the game is all is all Doom.
Doom.
Doom DUME Doom.
35:34
Oh, and our Kickstarter for Jupiter Hell has has all kinds of stuff.
They really, I think they really swing for the fence with this.
But oh, but actually before we do that, I have to do everyone's favorite segment of all the boring stats stuff.
35:50
So Jupiter Hell released early access on Steam August 1st 2019 one point O August 5th 2021 again another PC exclusive developed again by Chaos Forge, our solo dev Cornell and published by Hyper Strange who opposed published other games like Hostal, Brain damaged blood W Elderborn and another rogue like Empty shell.
36:18
Jupiter How Rogue rolls in on our rogue like data set from Steam as the 397th most popular rogue like with 1733 total reviews.
And for this I actually do have player play time in it so that your average player of Jupiter Hull has about 36 hours of game time in it.
36:39
OK, with all that aside, the first impression for this is wow.
This is what rogue likes could be like if they actually had a budget.
Yeah, yeah, that's that, That's true.
The the game looks pretty good, that's for sure.
36:54
For a like it is traditional sprites and and grid, but like it it's yeah, quite nice.
I feel like it does the IT it it captures a lot of the feeling of doom without necessarily capturing the cut off MIDI scream of the imp from actual old doom.
37:23
So like it does a good job of translating the the the vibe, how I imagine, you know, how we like you, you play the the games that you played in 1995.
If you go back and play them now, you're like, I could have sworn it had it had better graphics than this.
37:40
Like my brain remembers this being like vivid and real.
And this feels like what my brain imagined Doom was, you know, like my child brain says Doom, Doom is this.
It is pretty wild firing this game up and you know, playing the tutorial and for the first time seeing in a traditional rogue like ragdoll physics.
38:08
What?
Yeah, yeah, I feel like that was pretty sad.
Like they really did go for everything they went for.
Like not even like Super Nintendo sprites.
They went for full 3D modeled environments.
They went for like really cool procedural lighting effects.
38:27
I don't remember if there was destructible terrain, but yeah, like the the when you shoot a rocket and you see like the the enemies just like rag dolling around.
Pretty great, pretty great.
Yeah, but it still feels it.
38:42
It's great though, because it still feels kind of like it's not.
They're not 2D sprites, but it feels it's it's got it still has the the the genesequa of those of the the the Sprite based things.
Yeah, it does have that kind of 2.5 D Well, it is.
39:01
It is like a fully 3D environment.
But yeah, because of the force perspective, it does feel like it has that kind of Diablo 2 aesthetic.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's one of those.
And just seeing yeah, like quartz on series ragged all around is pretty great.
39:18
But Jupiter held starts with a cinematic an intro cinematic of you are Mike Taggart and you are coming back from your patrol story.
Sound familiar only to to have some I think the bases automated system shoot you down and Andrew, to your point earlier about Duke Nukem, you idiots are going to pay for shooting up my ride.
39:47
Copyright, copyright.
And then seeing you know, the the shambling zombie monsters coming out of the out of the out of the woodwork towards you and it it starts off kind of in the same dumarl fashion of your you've landed in you got to blast some monsters, got to figure out what's going on.
40:08
Ain't nothing they you know, more bullets can't solve kind of a deal.
And yeah, you and instead of going from Dumarel where you start on the the moons of Mars and you go Phobos demos Mars, but Mars is actually totally turned into hell.
40:25
You're, I think creatively on Jupiter or Jupiter's moons anyway.
You're starting from the furthest moons out with Ganymede, then Europa and then IO, and then you go to, you know, some, some basically the underworld effectively.
40:42
So I thought that was a nice kind of like neat change.
It felt thematically relevant, but also like creatively different.
Yeah, that's that's the important that the unique trademark very, very essential, similar but wholly unique and original idea.
41:03
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't even catch on to that.
Great, good observation and a good calculation by the devs.
Now, along with our increased budget here, I mean, we, we still have kind of all of the base systems we talked about with Dumarl, we still have weapon modifications.
41:21
We still have like armor, pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, the same.
It's, it's effectively the the exact same DNA and bones of Dumarl with a new modern package.
And that's not to say it's just like a Chamblee put together port.
41:37
Like it's, it's like you can see the DNA there, but you can see how well it's evolved since.
But with that extra budget comes nothing less than voice acting.
It's true.
It's true and.
What do we what do you think of our of Commander Shepard voicing our protagonist here?
41:56
Oh, wonderful, wonderful work.
I, I, I personally, again, having played a lot of Duke Nukem when I was a wee lad, very much appreciate the snarky voice over lines.
And but I also understand why there is why some people would not like that.
42:19
Because of course, the original Doom guy was basically a silent protagonist except for like bumping into walls and things.
So it's good that there is an option to turn that off or to modify it.
It's a slider I guess, right?
Yeah, yeah.
42:34
I mean, I, I liked it being there.
I my favorite of his snarky lines was if you just left the game for a second, you're like alt tab to look at the wiki or, you know, go do something else for a bit.
You'd be like, I'm getting bored over here.
42:51
Or you just start like, you know, like making fun of you for not playing the game.
And it's like, I don't feel like I've that like very rarely, if ever happens in other games where it like specifically calls out the fact that you're not playing the game right now.
Like, no, I'm paused.
43:08
How dare you.
How?
How dare you?
It's.
Kind of like the the Sonic the Hedgehog toe tapping animation.
There was a, a fun bit that I only just discovered before we hit recording where if you, if you bump up against a locked door, he'll go it's it's locked or he'll like do other things like fucking locked and then he'll get progressively angrier the more you bump into it, almost kind of like StarCraft unit clicking style.
43:32
You keep bumping and he's like, I told you, it fucking worked.
It's knocked and he just keeps getting angrier and I'm just like, OK, at first I was a little, I don't know, I was a little mixed on The Voice acting at first, but it kind of grew on me.
I thought, I have a note written down here that I'm not sure like where on the spectrum between Ash from Army of Darkness or closer to Bruce Willis's little brother.
43:53
It is, but it does.
I feel like it skews more towards ash from from Army of Darkness.
It does feel like it feels useful also at times where you're like blasting enemies and you want it and like, oh, I want to fire again and he's like no ammo and I'm like, oh, right out of ammo.
44:13
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mike Taggart.
Thanks, Mike.
For the voice reminder.
For sure, for sure that it serves it's it's good that it serves some mechanical purpose as well.
When so I played this game when it was like basically brand new and but I haven't played it like since then really.
44:37
And Scott, you mentioned the voice acting on Discord.
And I was like, I have no memory of this voice acting.
And I left pretty hard when I fired it up for the first time in, you know, three years.
And like, the first thing I'm greeted with is a cutscene with the main character talking.
44:54
I'm like, wow, how did I forget?
It's the first thing that happens.
Yeah, I think the the production value here is is very well done.
And one of my discussion bullet points here is like, does this does this like level of production value reset the for traditional rogue likes, these grid based turn based games?
45:17
Like does does this kind of reset the expectation of like I mean, obviously selling selling modern gaming audiences on something like the doom RL end of the spectrum of like old but good, but kind of clanky interfaces having to, you know, edit config files, that kind of thing.
45:38
Keyboard only.
Well, I guess there is mouse support, but anyway that kind of stuff.
Is is this sort of like 3D rendered visual presentation what traditional rogue likes need in order to compete in the modern gaming era?
45:57
I think me is probably too strong of a word.
I think it helps, but I also think that this is always going to be a niche.
Like you're not you're never going to be truly trying to get the the like broad mass market appeal with something Jupiter hell, might be might be getting closer, But like if you're getting any deeper into the traditional rogue like where you're really getting deep into systems and all of that.
46:26
I, I think it's the, it's the interactions and stuff that's, that's drawing you to the game.
And like ASCII is the, the pure essence of that where it's like, ah, I'm reading the matrix and it's just imprinting information into my eyeballs.
46:42
And I think that is almost an appeal of some, some rogue likes.
And like, having nice graphics is fun and good, but it doesn't necessarily like, I think I could have played this game and had most of the same level of enjoyment with ASCII graphics like I think it's actually had.
47:05
As far as I remember, I believe there is an ASCII mode to Jupiter Hell.
Oh.
Boy.
All right, let me go look at this.
I'm not now I don't know if that's confirmed or not.
And it's like with all podcasts, you know, I will, I will say things into the ether and people will correct me as as is their God-given right to do.
47:24
But I do believe I remember reading that I'm like, what are they?
Did they like 3D render the left parenthesis or something like?
How would that even look?
Interesting interesting I I I admire that nice little Easter egg.
I I wonder if surely there's an achievement for like beating the game with that on that's wild.
47:47
Well, so the the closest example going speaking to your question Scott, the closest example that I can think of is perhaps the XCOM series that when the sort of modern XCOM one came out whenever that was 15 years ago I want.
48:11
To say enemy unknown or.
Is it enemy?
Yeah, enemy unknown.
The first time it was the game was in three DI Guess is what I mean.
That was sort of a sort of what you're describing, you know, taking an old school, pretty like meaty mechanically, you know, and turn based game and revising it, updating it for a modern audience, Although I don't know exactly how popular that game was with mainstream audiences enough to warrant a sequel at least.
48:44
So I guess I'm, I'm saying that it's I, I guess it's possible that a traditional rogue like could could do this, maybe with the right IP I think.
I think the.
IP makes a big difference.
The other thing about Jupiter Hell that's interesting is like like what Colin was saying, you know, it is it is doom in all aspects, but and I feel like there's something there's something missing about like the identity or the soul of the game as a result.
49:14
Like I like to be clear, I really like Jupiter hell a lot.
I have a lot of fun playing it, but I have a note written down that like I couldn't I couldn't draw you a silhouette difference between a Ravager and a Reaver is in this game.
And I feel like in in the doom property, the doom IP, all of the and again, you know, this is like 2530 years worth of IP banking that's been going on.
49:39
So it has a little bit of a head start.
But like when you say Cacademon, like people like who are familiar with that know what that is immediately and they know exactly like what it's all about and like everything associated with it.
A watcher like I think in Jupiter held like you can, you can see where the inspiration is from, but I don't know that like it, it really kind of hits home.
50:05
Like for example, boss battles, for example, So like Dumarl, you have like this big build up to like just fighting.
I think they're two battle brothers or something.
And you it's like this big like build up visually with the level design and the and the the sound effects and you hear them coming from a distance.
50:24
Jupiter Hell, I believe most of the most, if not all the boss battles are in like kind of a central arena and you go to them and then you go and fight them.
It it feels very much more of like, OK, yeah, it's like, it, it, it feels less impactful.
50:44
It's still fun.
Like it's still fun, but like, you know, you're shooting a big robot versus like a a well known character from a well known video game series and it feels a little, it feels less, but I can't really articulate as to why.
51:03
It's like it's missing like some kind of crucial flavor to it.
I don't.
Know I I, I hear what you're saying.
Like the creature designs and everything in Jupiter Hell are good, but they they are missing that classic like well known zeitgeist embedded like status.
51:24
And part of that is just because Doom's been around for so long, but also part of it is that, you know, those designs are legitimately, like, good, most of them.
Or even just thinking like back to the Halo series, Like Halo is like very clearly ripped from aliens, but all of their monster design is like super distinct from aliens.
51:46
Right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Distinctness is a a very big part of it, yeah.
And so I feel like there's there's and there, you know, there's like, you know, Mancubus equivalent enemies like later in Jupiter Hell.
I'm like, OK, yeah, I get it.
But you know, there's, there's some kind of missing thing about like, Oh yeah.
52:05
I remember when I was fighting that like could, could you do a cosplay from of one of the enemies from Jupiter Hell and would anybody recognize it is maybe what I'm getting AT?
And you know, I don't think this game needs it necessarily.
I think it might be one of its weakest points, which is probably an element of praise because like if that's like the the biggest thing I can nitpick, you know, everything else is so well done in terms of like visual clarity.
52:34
Like one things that bugs me about Dumar El is there's there's like ammo on the floor.
Like I, I had walked past like rocket launchers numerous times because they blend into the, the terrain very well.
Whereas this like items on the floor are these giant glowing, almost like traffic signs.
52:51
You can't miss them.
And I feel like it's, it's very clear.
It's, you know, it's a hard thing to visually distinct, distinctify like 9mm ammo versus 762 or something.
But it does that.
And I'm like, OK, I know where to go and find the ammo for this particular gun I have equipped.
53:07
Great.
Another thing that is helpful is that we talked a little bit about the dodge system in Dumarl being a little opaque.
I think it's better here, maybe still a little opaque, but the cover system that you have, you run up, there's boxes everywhere and we talked about ragdoll physics.
53:28
Your cover will explode and like shoot stuff all over the place.
It's a very nice visual effect.
But you sidle up next to something, you have a little green half box next to you.
It's like, OK, I'm in cover and in the bottom corner it gives you a little blue percentage to say, oh, OK, this is what my dodge percentage.
53:45
Great.
Don't have to do any of that kind of mental math Very welcome.
I think in.
Yeah, I think that's a it's, it's not opaque.
It's opaque and it's in explaining to you how the mechanics works and like what you need to do.
54:02
But it's very, very clear in terms of if you move, it shows you like what percent dodge you have down in the bottom or what your what pain percent or what cover percent and it gives you the two hit percent.
54:18
So it's pretty clear and open about what you actually have going for you.
Like what your little like immediate status effects are from from dodging around or cover or whatnot, which I did find to be pretty useful.
54:36
I it was, it was a little bit hard to find out.
I, I found it somewhat annoying to figure out what was going to happen in the future.
So like what OK, if I get this perk, what does that mean for this?
54:52
Or like there's a gun on the ground, it has little perk on it.
The way that you look at that perk is to pick up the gun and look at it and then decide you don't want it and then put that gun back down and switch back to the gun that you had before, which I found kind of like.
It wasn't.
Yeah, it wasn't.
55:09
Like bad.
It was just kind of like, oh, I wish that there was just another button you could Click to see what that perk was immediately or or how how things would affect you in the future.
But for the most part, I thought it did a pretty good job of clearly giving you the information that you would want to have.
55:27
For sure.
And then like going, going back to the cover system, yeah, I was like, never confused about what my cover situation was.
And real quick mention the game should be commended for its tutorial.
55:45
I, we have, you know, two weeks to play these games and I had played it, I played Jupiter Hell already, but I realized, oh, I'm gonna have to replay the, the tutorial.
And I put off playing more Jupiter Hell 'cause I'm like, oh, no, I gotta, I'm dreading the tutorial.
56:00
And then when I finally got to it, I'm like, oh, this is super streamlined and convenient and, you know, one of the better tutorials we've played, I feel like.
It's very short and it gets across like basically everything in 2 minutes, 5 minutes if that it's.
56:17
Super.
Impressive.
Yeah, I'd like, I had completely forgotten how the how the cover system works.
Go into the tutorial.
I'm like how how was the tutorial?
And it walks you through all the steps like, OK, thank you.
And yeah, I think that like, yeah, there's just, there's so much, there's so much good stuff.
56:34
Like this is this is such a good Trojan horse for I think people who are already in to like shooters or turn based tactical games, Andrew, like you were saying, like XCOM, this would be a great gateway drug for them into more traditional rogue like kind of games that I'm sure we'll cover in the future as well.
56:56
But yeah, it has it has all the trappings of like light RPG building.
One thing that kind of bugged me about Dumarl was when you pick your class and your list of traits, which are all all have like hilariously over over testosterone names to them, like like bad motherfucker and like, you know, hell runner and all those things very chuckle worthy make their appearance back again here.
57:25
But in Dumarl, if you if you happen to pick a certain combinations of things that can lock you out of like the really top tier master traits, like, oh, you can't, you can't be, you know, the the ultra Omega super badass because you took one point in technician.
57:44
Sorry, no nerds allowed.
No.
Nerds allowed and Jupiter hell I think is a lot more forgiving in that you can, it doesn't.
It doesn't have that restriction in it, which I I very much appreciate.
And yeah, I think that like the the active abilities that you have in Jupiter Hell are also, I don't know that you would need them in Dumar L, but I'm glad they're here where you have these.
58:11
Depending on what class you pick your Marine scout technicians are, you can press a button to have your fury meter be exchanged for a little bit of health regen.
Or if you have an energy meter, you can use that to to stealth your way away and, you know, get back into a flanking position.
58:34
Very, very kind of creative stuff.
Or you can create like a smoke cloud as well, depending on another class that you pick.
And I think like those are all really great ways to augment the play style of the game.
So I, I had a, a run where I was a marine and I was unlocked an ability that allowed me to just like press a button to run and you get like a dodge bonus and stuff.
58:55
But it was great 'cause I could run away from engagements and I'm getting surrounded.
Hit that run button, see you, see you slowpokes later.
And just like run all the way back to the beginning of the of the level.
All right, all my ammo's here, pick up, pick up, pick up, heal, heal, heal.
And then they're coming one by one through the door.
59:11
Blam blam.
Like the rag dolls are flying over the place.
It's a great time, Colin.
How?
How has your boss battle experiences been going?
Not great.
I've had frustrating experiences with the boss of the first first moon the the bot warden.
59:33
I mean, I, I know that the answer is to get good and earlier when you're talking about, oh, playing it on easy, I was like, oh, I should probably play it on easy just because we're have less time and I was especially time crunched this past two weeks I've been playing it all on medium and be like, let's just 'cause I, I, I'm, I'm a smart boy, right?
59:58
I know how to play rogue likes like I'm, I'm, I'm not going to play it on, on your little Pansy boy mode.
So.
I'm too young to die.
Yeah, exactly.
So yeah, I, I got pretty frustrated last night.
I'm pretty sure I was like one I, I, I think I got it down to like four hit points or something.
1:00:20
So I was, the next shot would have killed this bot warden thing.
And I was, was like, how was I supposed to have beaten this thing?
I thought I had a good build for it, but it turns out you have to get real close in order for that build to work.
And getting close hurt me.
1:00:37
Well, let me tell you fellas, here's what you got to do.
You got to go shotgun mode on this mother.
It's it's easy.
You just got to follow the dogma of, of, of doom, one of Doom 2, super shoddy, not one, but two shotguns.
1:00:55
And you got to get in close and you got to weave and you got to use cover and boom, boom, boom, boom.
And then you got to run out of shells and then you got to panic, and then you got to run away and then you get down to five health and then you barely get away with smoke grenade.
Yeah, I also had some tough times with the with the bosses.
1:01:11
I do declare.
Yeah, I think it should be noted that Jupiter Hell is tough and I think Dumar also tough.
And I think there's no loss to honor in playing on the easiest mode because like even I, I've only played Jupiter Hill on the easiest mode and it's still really hard.
1:01:30
Like really, really hard.
And because there's again, a lot of systems going on, there's a lot of stuff to kind of get your get your head wrapped around.
And once you once you kind of understand those kind of tactical advantages, then yeah, like you can apply them as needed.
1:01:47
But yeah, like the aspect of opening the door, like shooting the exploded explosive barrel, like just on the other side of the door to like damage the robot and then like running around to the other door and then doing the same thing there, like popping a smoke grenade.
There's like all these like, you know, tactical tactical situations you can apply or you can be like what I just did.
1:02:08
Like, was Con really having that hard of a time?
Again, easy mode.
I'd had no idea you were playing on medium.
I I unlocked the trait Gunkata for my my technician and which allowed me to dual wheeled pistols and like shoot them basically at automatic rates.
1:02:26
Go in and I just like mowed down the the boss that Colin was having trouble with and like, am I really good at this game or is this just easy mode?
I think it's easy mode because there are there are also like some of these branches in Jupiter Hell give you very cog mind style options of like, oh, you like solve this puzzle over here and it has consequences later on where you can bypass that fight entirely and you can just like use some key cards and all right, all the bots on that floor are disabled kind of the thing.
1:02:57
Yeah, I think my real problem is that going down the side paths really does give you a lot of good stuff.
And I, I think I was mostly just like, I want to get to the next place.
So I just kept going down the main path and not doing the side paths.
1:03:16
And I mean, you literally just get you, you get more levels and you get more perks from the levels.
You get better stuff.
There's there's some, there's a lot of options in Jupiter Hell for like different play styles.
There's like there's challenge modes, but there's things I think they're called trials, which are like run modifiers.
1:03:36
And one of them, Colin, you might be interested in is like, it's, it's like it's easy mode, I think.
And also like there's like a streamlined version where there's like there's fewer levels.
I, I don't, I think there's like no or like basically no branches.
1:03:53
And it's like the, the more kind of distilled quintessential.
It's almost like the D the Dumar L ified version of Jupiter hell.
And like the, the terminals that you come across don't have any like story stuff.
It's just like only just give me the stuff to shoot.
1:04:09
Just give me something to shoot aspect of it.
And there's, I don't know, like there's just five or ten of those kind of different game modes that you can you can apply here.
So I think those might be, you know, worthwhile to explore for for people that are looking looking for like, yeah, this, you know, this is interesting, but I want to get to, you know, the the later levels faster.
1:04:29
This kind, I think gives you that route to explore.
And then once you're familiar with the late game a little better, then you can open it up to like your your arch angle of death mode of running around with, you know, pistols only and you can't pick up ammo or what have you, because you're such an Uber badass, Which I think is welcome because some of the the later levels in Jupiter hell are really cool.
1:04:53
Like you go from Ganymede Station and it's kind of stereotypical space station to to Europa, which is like this like ice ice environment, which is very well done.
I think the visuals in this game look great in terms of like the environment design.
1:05:09
Yeah, Super Doom 3, which I have a lot of nostalgia for and I I appreciate.
Did was was IO in Doom 3 the lava level with all of the.
I mean, you know, like in the in the L sections I suppose.
1:05:28
Yeah.
And then yeah, after.
And again, like I, as you know, an Astro geek, I appreciate this.
Where you're going from the moons of Jupiter, but it's also relevant where Europa is an ice moon and IO is a lava moon.
And then you go to Dante, which is the underworld moon of Jupiter that everyone's familiar with.
1:05:50
Yeah, you wrote your thesis on that, right?
Yeah, that's the one, the Dante moon.
But yeah, like there's there's a lot of neat stuff to explore later on.
I was running through the the Europa moon, one of the branches, I think it was Europa and one of the branches there, there's like this big huge frozen temple that's being excavated, spoiler alert.
1:06:13
And you run through it's like, oh, all these like pickups here.
And like, the more pickups you pick up, the like a text thing comes up across the screen and be like, you're getting greedy immortal dot, dot, dot.
Like, yeah.
But nothing bad is going to happen if I pick up this ominous frozen heart at the center of the cathedral, right?
1:06:33
Monsters galore spawn in.
I hit that run button, skedaddle out of there as fast as I can.
It's like, oh, sweet, I've got this cool frozen heart I can use for something later.
Like this game is kind of filled with all sorts of stuff like that, which is super fun.
Yeah.
1:06:49
I think like if you if you have the the patience to play on easy mode and mow enemies down with with dual wielding Uzi 9mm, then then yeah, I think it's worth your while.
One thing that that people wanted us to to kind of point out was what do you think of the idea of corner shooting?
1:07:12
This was this was a thing in Dumarl where in order to, and I appreciate that Jupiter hell doesn't really require this, that like I think a lot of high level play in Dumarl abuses the game system where you are like for there's one thing called radar shooting, where like you'll take a shotgun and you'll just like shoot it off into the off screen.
1:07:35
And if you hear a monster, you'll know a monster's out there or like what direction they are.
Corner shooting I think is like the idea of like circle strafing around pillars of the game and kind of like abusing your ability to like shoot like 11 tile over more than they can back at you.
1:07:56
And for like when I was researching like, well, how do I, how do I get good at Dumaro?
Cuz I keep dying to the stupid cyber demon seeing tactics like that.
I'm like, I don't know, it feels kind of cheesy.
It feels like it's, it's sort of like a Band-Aid applied to this really old game, but I never really felt that I needed to abuse the game's mechanics for Jupiter Hell at all.
1:08:19
Was that was that everyone else's experience?
Did it feel kind of like relatively straightforward?
I think so I I feel like what you're describing with the the corner corner shooting is it, I mean could be expounded in in and developed into like an interesting game system.
1:08:37
But it's like, you know, the official game systems, the non, you know, pro Strat exploits that exist in Jupiter.
Hell are, you know, interesting enough?
Yeah, I don't generally like the the, if it's an exploit type system where it's like, oh, the only way for you to know that this is a good way to do it is that like looked it up on the forums.
1:08:59
I like, I feel like the longer we've done this podcast, the more I've become insistent that the game mechanics be properly and adequately explained within the game itself.
I think that's a flaw of a lot of games is that they're just like, well, you have a wiki, they'll just go look that up.
1:09:16
It is true, but it's kind of annoying.
And like this, like Jupiter Howl and Doom RL are popular enough games that the wikis are like complete and accurate.
But you know, for a smaller game, sometimes it's like, oh, well, you know, this is just a wiki stub, so you just don't know how that mechanic works.
1:09:38
And then it's just I want the game to be played.
I want the mechanics to be explained and like, oh, the best way to play is to like strafe around a corner and use the the the like aim mechanic thing.
Like independently discovering that would be pretty cool, but not independently discovering it and just being like, I'm bad at this game because I don't know about this thing would be frustrating.
1:10:01
I don't think that's anything that I mean, I I think I'm just bad at Jupiter hell, because I haven't played that much yet.
I don't think that it was that I was missing some core mechanic of the game.
I just, I knew everything.
I just wasn't using it, synergizing it correctly yet.
1:10:20
Yeah, there's a lot.
Like there were plenty of times where I was like, oh, right, I probably should have shot that explosive barrel.
Oh, right.
I probably, I think I had a smoke grenade.
I think I should have probably run away rather than just try to face tank this Warden bot machine gun to the face.
1:10:37
As as someone who has also put in a a lot of time into cog mind, Colin, how would you like, would you say Jupiter Hell is like is in that realm of like really crunchy tactical rogue likey, strategic decision making?
1:10:54
I think that yes and no.
I think that the the decision points are slightly at slightly different points.
Like for Cog mind, so many times the correct answer is to run away.
And so it's the fight or flight decision.
1:11:13
Is the like the the really like crunchy decision in Cog mine versus Doom or Jupiter?
Hell, the crunchy decision is how to get into tactical cover because you're going to fight all the people.
1:11:29
Like I feel like a failure if I leave a A level without having killed every single enemy on the floor, which is, that's not like a feasible way to play Cog mind or even some of the other, you know, some like Jupiter.
Hell, your goal is to kill everything, not necessarily just to get through the level as fast as you can and pick up the stuff and grab and like, sneak away.
1:11:54
Yeah, it is a a fundamentally different leveling system.
I did, I did have a, a discussion point of like, should you just like get a free upgrade point when you get to the elevator?
And I think that's, it's probably no.
But at the same time, like, yeah, it is a totally different game 'cause it's, it's killing the monsters is what gives you XP in Doomar El and Jupiter Hell.
1:12:18
So you are incentivized to go through the level and hunt them down in order to gain levels.
Like, that's that's the ethos of Doom in a nutshell.
Right, for a generic rogue like I might say yeah you should get some points when you go down the level.
But for a doom rogue like or doom inspired ones like, well, no.
1:12:37
The point of this game is to to shoot things with a shotgun in the face.
And I mean.
I can't there.
There were so many times where I was playing this where I found myself, like when I was trying to charge across a gap to like hit something and get up close.
1:12:54
I would click the forward button really fast, even though I know that the, the clicking the up arrow faster will not make me move faster in the game.
Or like, you know, you get sucked into the momentum of, of, of the game really easily, which is not something that something like Tales of Magee Isle like that very rarely happened.
1:13:19
You know, that was it.
Every, every, every action is a very thought out action.
Didn't usually get swept up in the like run and shotgun something.
Yeah, there are some neat kind of animation related Easter eggs in this game too.
1:13:34
Like what you're describing were like you, if you run and you keep holding down that button, which you shouldn't, like should you do that in a turn based game, you'll notice that like the character will like start leaning forward more in like a running posture because like the game almost becomes like super hot in a sense of like, all right now it's like full action mode.
1:13:53
And also if you have, if you have one of the perks that allows you to continuously shoot enemies while you're moving, it has this like this game would look amazing.
I've got to look up some speed runs of this game because this game is just gonna be wild for like people doing like 20 minute speed runs of the whole thing where they're just like running and gunning and shooting.
1:14:13
It'd probably look like a very doom style experience, which I think is one of the things they were complaining about with their with their trailer design was people thinking that this was like a real time action game or like how, how do you like how do you get across that it's turn based, but also like this very fluid animation system at the same time, like like what Andrew was describing with X com earlier, right?
1:14:34
You move your unit, you shoot, there's an animation of them shooting.
It's like a 5 minute long process for you to figure out that you missed your 95% shot at the at the monster.
Whereas with this, it's like the animation and of, of moving and shooting is simultaneous, which is like, it's a super subtle thing, but you know how like in Cog mind, we're like, there's a hundred enemies on the screen and like you shoot one of them, then you have to wait for the next one to shoot and then the next one to shoot.
1:15:01
Right.
It like it.
It like ripples down as you.
Each one is like deciding what to do.
Yeah, there's there's something to be said for the this.
I don't know what system they use for that kind of for that engine, but like it's so streamlined and it feels like why don't all traditional rogue legs have this or like all turn based, you know, Mystery Dungeon rogue legs.
1:15:25
Even it feels it feels like, you know, how did we ever live without this in this kind of turn based system, I feel.
Like, I, I mean, I do think that there is something it does not give you perfect information.
Like things could happen fat like if if all of the enemies had like a lot of different things they could do, I could see it being hard to follow what was happening.
1:15:50
But most of the time it's like this guy has a gun and he's shooting at me and I'm also shooting at him.
So like there's not a whole lot of like information that you need to take in.
Besides, did I get hit?
When did he get hit?
Versus if you're in like cog mine, you're like, OK, I really need to know, like what are the status of all these things?
1:16:07
Or like you're playing tome.
It's like, OK, I need to know, has this orc warlord guy, has he triggered his barbarian engaged thing?
Because if yes, then I need to run away for three turns until it that cools down and my thing cools down.
1:16:24
So I can like you need to know like exact turn counts and people like see things and know when they happen versus like the simplified nature of Jupiter.
Hell lets you get away with having that smooth.
1:16:40
Like I don't need to know that information quite as intensely, I can just run in and blam stuff with my shotgun and that feels great.
And I think that's a excellent way to mention that the the flow state of this game is very good, very good indeed.
1:16:59
You're just clacking away, two hands on the keyboard, having a good time clearing levels, blasting enemies and listening to that, like, cool soundtrack.
Like groovy soundtrack.
Yeah, it's very fun to play.
1:17:15
Not.
On soundtrack.
Oh yeah.
Well, no, I wasn't gonna totally do a dissertation on that.
But yeah, it's it is a surprisingly, surprisingly sometimes I think, you know, turn based games are maligned as being boring.
1:17:34
And this game is, you know, anything but it's, it's quite engaging almost at all times.
I thought it was like I I've ended up playing most of the games we've played, even the turn based traditional rogue like ones with a mouse.
1:17:55
I think this is the one of the first ones I've played entirely.
No mouse whatsoever and did not feel like that mattered in the slightest.
A really good job of like letting you get all of the information, navigate everything super easily without using needing to use a mouse.
1:18:11
Mouse would be slower and worse.
Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of funny that like Dumarl has like more intuitive native mouse support.
I'm not sure if Jupiter Held needs it, but I was like, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Jupiter Jupiter Hell has support for joypad support.
1:18:31
So like for Xbox controllers, because I was playing this on the like, I think I've played Jupiter hell on the Steam Deck more than on my desktop computer and it, it works really well.
Like I, I spent, I don't know, maybe like four or five hours trying to configure the, the Dumar L key binds for the Steam Deck.
1:18:48
And once you get it going it, it works pretty well.
But yeah, Jupiter Hell, I felt like it was it was weird how well it worked with a controller and the keyboard also felt very, very intuitive and useful.
And like all the buttons like it, it tells you on this like press M for more info.
1:19:07
Like I yes, I will.
The music, I think, Colin, I think you were alluding to, I think the music in Dumarl is much, much better than Jupiter Hell.
I think kind of with that same aspect of like it's missing the soul element.
Like obviously the Dumarl stuff is aping from what what was the note that I have in here?
1:19:28
The Doom RL soundtrack originally came from the the Doom 3 classic mod where Sonic Clang developed it like that music specifically I think for that mod.
So you know, it has this kind of like, and obviously you know, it's it's remix and inspired from OG 93 Doom, but you can see where that that soul and inspiration comes.
1:19:53
And I was thinking like, well, even if you took E1M1 out and you just had all the rest of like, you know, the doom inspired music, but stuff that like, I don't really think of a whole lot in Jupiter Hell, I think that would be like an absolute slam dunk.
And for the most part, I felt like the Jupiter hell soundtrack sort of fell flat for me.
1:20:13
It definitely didn't have that kind of oomph for boss battles.
Where?
You know, we played on our summer special, The Unholy Cathedral.
Music like that is that is doom ass music for a doom ass boss fight.
I don't think I ever really got that kind of aesthetic point in Jupiter Hell.
1:20:33
Not that the game really needed it per SE, but it would have been a welcome addition I think.
It definitely doesn't have anything that stuck in my head like I'm, I'm on my other screen right now, like trying to find the music and listening to it and like I have no memory of any of these songs.
1:20:49
Like my brain has just filtered out the music entirely.
Like if you said, did they have a soundtrack, I'd be like, probably it's it's there.
It's just not like something to write home about.
I think the Jupiter LL, I mean, is trying to do something very different when it comes to the music.
1:21:09
Doom, like the original doom and doom RL, all the tracks are like very thrash metal, which tend to be kind of, you know, a little faster, a little poppier, more like melodic, more more like earworm type of type of tracks.
1:21:27
Whereas Jupiter Hell is going for stuff that's a bit more atmospheric and, you know, black metal, death metal, sort of sort of so I do want to call it specifically in in the Valhallan spaceport, which is where you fight the warden bot or whatever.
1:21:49
It has this a little bit of a faster guitar riff as sort of its main, the main part of the melody, which is a welcome kind of change.
And I, I think it's, you know, meant to, you know, sort of is, is to complement the boss fight, but that's accompanied by some, some vocals which are come in the form of this like yelling that is being like echoed and, and kind of has this cool chanting sort of an aspect to it.
1:22:23
And I thought that was really interesting.
And and and while again, not as catchy as like the original doom soundtrack, I admire that they went for something perhaps a little more, I don't know, elevated something a little more, a little deeper, if you will.
1:22:47
But that's coming from, I mean, I don't know, that's coming from like a a metal head who gravitates towards thrash metal generally and power metal and like melodic stuff.
I was.
I was made kind of surprised that they didn't have some kind of more on the nose E1M1 inspired track to kick to kick the campaign off with.
1:23:08
Maybe, maybe it's a good idea that they don't kind of poke the bear too much with the IP lawyers.
Well, do we want to jump into rankings?
Yeah, let's do it.
All right, Colin, kick us off with our rankings here.
I'm going to give Jupiter Hell A7, putting it right in the middle of a bunch of other seven point OS.
1:23:31
I thought it was a pretty good game.
There's definitely some stuff that like I found for the most part, there was like the flow state was fun and good and interesting.
And there were a couple of times where I just felt like there weren't enough levers to pull, especially in the boss fight.
1:23:51
Or just like there were a couple times where I just got kind of trapped and I'm like, well, there's no way I could have won this.
Probably mad 'cause bad.
But yeah, like there's a lot of stuff I like about it and but maybe not anything that was so like, there's nothing that pulled it in.
1:24:13
So it was like, Oh yeah, this is just a great game.
There was a lot of stuff that made it a good game and very little that made it a bad game.
So like I can see, but I can definitely see where someone could love this game a lot.
I could see you getting into real flow state playing it.
1:24:30
I could see myself playing it a lot more and like getting better at it and be like, Oh no, Colin, you're an idiot.
You should have liked this more.
So I'm probably going to play more of it.
And so that's probably the the the greatest compliment I can give.
I think I'll go next.
1:24:48
I'm going to put slight Doom RL here and it is a 7.2, tying it with Warsim and Jupiter.
Hell is an 8 pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it.
Like I didn't expect to go in like having a like a fun experience.
1:25:07
I thought it was gonna be like a net hack style, like, oh, you're gonna you're gonna wait for the phase of the moon to be right in order for all this stuff to work.
But no, it's it's very much a very straightforward, very straightforward game that I think like has a surprising amount of depth to it.
1:25:23
I think it's still worth checking on, even if if it is 20 plus years old and and can enroll in the the Martian military itself.
You might have to if you're listening to this, you're like, I want to check this out and you might go download it and and it fails to boot.
You might have to go and edit some config files setting the network connection line in the in the config Lua thing to false.
1:25:48
I don't know why that's still troubling things up, but you know, it's I feel like that's kind of emblematic of these solar sort of older games in general.
And I feel like it it has this really great legacy of like games at the time trying to boil the ocean and putting feature after feature in there.
And this feels so much more streamlined and focused that you can really just like, all right, this time I'm going to focus on doing this thing and not get distracted about all the other stuff.
1:26:13
Jupiter hell great game have fun every time that I'm playing it only just beat the the Harbinger's throne yesterday and yeah, I I thought it was fun.
Could stand to have maybe a little bit more lore I think to it a little bit more kind of like individualized flavor.
1:26:37
I think it's fun.
I think it like it is definitely a really solid intro to the traditional rogue leg space.
It has all of like the graphic stuff that your your standard Call of Duty player would would find interesting.
Yeah, I think it's it's totally worth a shot Right on.
1:26:52
So both these.
Games speak to me on a a lot of levels.
My love for FPS games, my enjoyment of the brutal metal aesthetic and sound, of course, and but also from like development standpoint, I really admire what the devs have done.
1:27:21
And it's really great to see this, you know, awesome decade spanning fan project culminate with an original full-fledged, you know, basically, you know, AAA, you know, I don't know, 22A's and 1/2 production is, is is really great.
1:27:44
And also both of these games get a lot of points because of how roguy they are, but still being maintaining to be being able to maintain accessibility and just sort of like baseline fun.
1:28:04
And one of the points was something that was kind of fun when I rebooted, booted up, I should say Jupiter Hell for the first time, was that I discovered my I.
I went and looked at my high score list cause of course keeps track of all your runs like any good rogue like.
1:28:23
And I like both of these games enough to have actually bothered to put some thought into my character names.
So I got to look at my high score list of all the goofy names that I'd come up with, which we're all supposed to be kind of, you know, faux macho mystery science theater, you know, informed stuff, including some some wonderful, very serious character names like Sean off shotgun, Butch Butcherson, Ricky Rod iron and my favorite Cal Astro Tough.
1:28:57
One of my Co workers is named Mike Butcher I feel.
Like maybe I'll have to play with him next round.
There you go.
Absolutely.
That's sad.
That's a perfect.
A perfect Doom guy type of a name for sure.
Big Mclarge.
Huge.
Precisely.
1:29:14
Precisely.
And yeah, anyway, all that being said, I think that again, the fact that these games are true rogue likes really kind of bumps them up in my personal rankings.
1:29:29
So I'm going to give both Doom Aurel and Jupiter Hell a rating of 8.1, putting them into my ranking list as number 6.66 baby.
All right, keeping it metal.
1:29:48
And what what would Will's score have been?
We do not know.
He is making it 6.66 negative.
Yeah, probably.
But he'll be back soon, it should be noted.
Yes, well, yeah, that's gonna put Jupiter hell as.
1:30:05
Our new top traditional rogue leg on our on our rankings list coming in at at lucky number 13, which is very poignant.
Yeah, so some similar games just barely beat out Cog mind by point O3.
1:30:21
Yeah, but Will, Will's anchoring down that rating pretty pretty.
Well, there.
So yeah, don't worry when he plays Jupiter, Hell, he'll pull it down.
So some similar games if you're like, yeah.
More to explore.
I wanna I wanna give me give me some recommendations here.
Dumarl.
I think the other games created by the developer Aliens, RL Diablo, RL Berserk worth checking out.
1:30:45
We mentioned Cogmind a whole lot in this episode.
It's like Dumarl on super steroids with a modern interface.
There's one also by the Cog mine dev that I think is supposed to be an X com ASCII rogue like called X at COM.
Actually let me let me double check if I have that right.
1:31:04
Of course, the first thing that you get when you Google that is former Twitter.
And now I'm trying to figure out X at com rogue like.
OK, yes, it is X at symbol com.
It's not the the horror show, the it's not the the the pit of screaming demons that former Twitter is It's a it's an actual ASCII rogue like Jupiter.
1:31:33
Hell, this one was kind of funny.
I thought there's a there's a bunch of these YouTube videos going around like guess what guys?
They finally made doom into a rogue like called the doom infinite mod, which I think is a it's, it's your, it's actual like doom doom.
1:31:50
It's a it's a, you know, like a the, the the mod system for for OG doom that I'm spacing on the name of.
But it's like that with like enter the gungeon style roguiness, if you can imagine, so like gun drops and and enemy stuff like that.
1:32:07
But I I think it's very funny that all the stuff that we talked about today, their branding in that YouTube videos, you know, imagine doom and then imagine a rogue like and imagine if you combined the two.
But that that might be worth checking out for the doom aesthetic, especially if you're more into the the kind of actiony FPS end of the spectrum.
1:32:29
Some more that are kind of in the turn based zone of traditional rogue likes would be.
I always forget the name of this game, so I'm glad I wrote it down.
Dead, not signal lost is like is like if you were watching like the little dots from from like the aliens movies of like the little radar dots of them like running around.
1:32:55
It's like that.
The rogue like Xenomarine quasi morph has a has a very banging metal soundtrack, sort of the stars of the pit previous episode, and then one that I'll put on here.
Not because it's aesthetically similar at all, but Tangledeep is one that has a very good modern like SNES style interface to it, traditional rogue like, but very high production value, just like Jupiter hell does.
1:33:21
Maybe more of kind of like the 16 bit era, but definitely worth checking out for sure.
OK and yeah, I think that's gonna wrap up our I think our our berserk power up here is wearing off after 90 minutes of of blabbing here.
1:33:38
So we're going to wind down with our e-mail that you can write in with your your fun stories of installing Doom on 10 floppy disks to grogpodzone@gmail.com.
Whenever I post stuff on our Mastodon Grogpod at game dev dot plays tangentially related to Doom RL, There's there's an amazing amount of people out there that come out and say, oh, I remember playing this game 15 years ago and like having all of like these, these people that I never thought would have had such a fondness for an old, potentially obscure game come out and appreciate it.
1:34:13
Grogpod a game damned out place.
You can see me posting pictures of my cat in my lap playing Doom RL on the Steam Deck.
Should you be so desire and all of our rankings and ratings and other apocrypha and stuff is on the website of Grogpod dot zone.
Our next episode.
1:34:31
Scott, what do you have lined up for us?
Well, Scott, our our next episode is one that I was pretty distracted by while prepping for our combined episode here.
Polish up those D sixes folks 'cause you're going to be throwing a lot of them.
1:34:49
We are playing slice and dice the dice extremely dice heavy combat game where it is it does exactly what it says on the tin.
There are dice and you are slicing.
1:35:05
But I am very excited to check this game out in more depth 'cause there's, there's a, there's a ton of stuff in here and each run can be as short as you want it and each run can go on for 15 plus hours if you really wanted to.
1:35:21
There's there's a lot of fun stuff to check out.
Yeah, that'll be an exciting one.
Very likely a, a game that we can convince Will to come on and and have a good time with.
So yeah, that's gonna wrap up our our fifty and 51st games of the podcast.
1:35:39
And to play us out Will will be some good music for when for when your demonic presence is at unsafe levels.
We'll have to put the the podcast lockdown in effect.
1:37:11
The None.
