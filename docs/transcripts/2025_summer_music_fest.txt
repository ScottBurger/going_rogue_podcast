Greetings friends and welcome to a very special hot summer episode of the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast wherein normally each one of these episodes we talk about a roguelike or roguelite game.
We throw some made-up number rankings on them and revisit them at the end of the season for all the all the good ones.
0:59
But this is a special one.
This is a special music episode that you have joined us with.
I am your chiptune DJ, host of the podcast Scott Burger and with me are my major scale Co host.
Hey, you know it's me, Andrew the piano man, Harsh man, coming at you.
1:18
And me, Colin, the static note that they use for drums.
Smith.
I love that note.
Well this this very special episode is the one where I give my my Co host a break from me cracking the whip and forcing them to play games they hate every week to stop and listen to to games they may or may not like.
1:38
Every week we are going over some soundtrack tunes from Rogue Dum, from really old to really new.
And the one that is is playing us in for our intro.
Here is a a previous episode.
We we covered the PlayStation one version of this game, which is as your dreams, specifically the the 1997 Game Boy Color version of as your dreams compose.
2:06
And this is the the title screen soundtrack composed by, I'm pretty sure the same guy who did the PlayStation One soundtrack.
I'm going to butcher everyone's all the artist names here, which is why everyone tunes in the 1st place.
Composed by Hiroshi Tamawiri for the 1997 Game Boy Color as your dreams.
2:27
Yeah, I think based on our previous episode of the, the PlayStation One, I I've played a little bit of, of the Game Boy Color version.
What, what, what do you?
What's the immediate reaction here from from the rest of the pod crew?
2:46
Well, just like the gameplay of As Your Dreams, the music immediately brings to mind Pokémon, Pokémon Red and Blue.
And I had to check to see like when when what got released and and not, you know, suggesting necessarily that one, you know, influenced the other per SE.
3:04
But it definitely sounds like the type of music I'd like to be listening to, like to be hearing when I hop on my trusty bike and I'm, you know, running around, pedaling around town.
Yeah, I would say I like the music better than I liked the game.
I think it was a pretty, pretty solid intro music.
3:20
It's, it's always interesting to remember that like, despite the fact that video games weren't super advanced then, people were just as good at composing music.
Like, people have not dramatically increased their ability to, like, think of new songs.
So like, you got all the background tracks.
3:38
I mean, you can make some pretty, pretty good music with some pretty limited technology.
Yeah.
And the from what little I've dabbled with the the Game Boy Color ROM for Azure Dreams, like it's actually like a pretty halfway decent Game Boy Color game.
3:54
Like it's not, it's clearly well, I don't know, I mean, I've I've gone back and played Pokémon Red.
I I think as your dreams game, what color is definitely worth checking out if you're remotely interested in like those those really old grindy Pokémon games.
4:13
I think it would surprise me.
I think it kind of it weirdly fixes a lot of the criticisms that we have for the PlayStation one.
Wait, did the Game Boy one come after the PlayStation?
1.
I think it did.
I think it was like the year after or something.
Oh, weird.
Yeah, I forget.
Like, the Game Boy does not neatly slot within generations.
4:32
It's like, oh, Game Boy Color is in a nebulous time period.
Who knows when it existed?
I yeah, tough to say.
Tough to say for sure.
And then like the Game Boy Advance, they can that can along at some point.
You know, who knows who can keep track of all this, this wild Game Boy technology?
4:50
Well, Speaking of Game Boy technology, we got a we got a packed agenda here.
So I'm gonna I'm gonna move us right along into our our next non color 1991 Game Boy game.
I believe this is stage 3 from the Game Boy game Cave Noir.
5:50
You're listening to Cave Noir.
I believe that I, I said.
Is that the name of the radio station you're listening to?
Cave.
Noir Cave GROG, this is.
Hey, Ave.
Cave.
Noir.
6:07
I said this was this was soundtrack #10 I think this is actually the the soundtrack to quest number one from Cave Noir composed by Shinji Takasaka and Yoshiyuki Hagiwara for the 1991 Game Boy, non Game Boy.
6:25
And this comes from a a Japanese only release game, Cape Noir.
Again, another traditional roguelike for the Game Boy that I'm sure 10s of people have heard and played, but there actually is a, an English translation ROM that exists out there.
6:46
So of course I was like, well, I got to, I got to check this out after seeing some streamers play it.
Downloaded the ROM and it's actually like more interesting than you think it would be soundtrack.
And possible. 1991 Holy smoke.
7:04
That is that's that's an oldie.
That's that's less than what rogue came out according to my sources. 1980 So I mean almost almost made it into that first decade of of rogue dump.
I I really appreciate.
7:19
I assume it takes place in a cave.
Surely it takes place in a cave.
It does look like it takes case very, very quickly into the track.
There's, there's the series of like descending notes, which like really brings to mind the, the echo that one might hear, of course, as you're traversing The Cave.
7:38
Honestly, I mean, maybe I'm just being subconsciously influenced by the name of the game, but it, it feels like it's it's like pitch perfect, no pun intended for the theme and and set in a an atmosphere.
I I was digging it because then at the end of that, the, the, the series of descending notes, there was then like a nice little like flourish of the same notes, which got me like ready to yeah, yeah, exactly.
8:03
To be spelunkin.
Yeah, this game is, is really good for like a coffee break session of like and and again, like weirdly like super good on the Steam Deck.
Like you, you get this going on the Steam Deck.
It's like, oh, you're reliving those Game Boy, Game Boy days super well where like you have.
8:24
So this is this is like one of the dungeons of the game.
There's four dungeons and they all start off like comically easy like kill 1 monster or like collect one.
They call them orbs.
They just look like trophies or something.
Orbs.
But as you, as you like complete that quest, it has this hilarious like little animation of the character, like ascending up and like it just, it has so much like hilarious charm to it.
8:47
For a 1991 traditional roguelike game for the Game Boy that like wow.
Yeah, there's like there's just like a lot of charming and cuteness to it.
But also like as you get further into these quests, they become like a lot more like crunchy puzzles to them where so like one of them is like collect one orb.
9:08
Oh, that's like super easy.
This game is for babies.
Then you get to like collect like 6 orbs and you have like you have 8 inventory slots.
The orbs like take up your inventory slots and this is just like one of the dungeons.
So anyway, definitely worth hunting down where that English ROM exists through whatever legal channels you have to do so.
9:30
And I, I, I had a, a note here for other gameboy rogue likes to check out.
There's one called powder by Jeff late, which is a it's an open source, I guess.
Like there's a version of it that you can like download and play on like a Gameboy ROM flash card.
9:47
And I like, I had a, a, a joke segment planned here of like, all right, next we're going to play the soundtrack for that one and just have to be like 3 minutes of dead dead air because there's no music to it.
But like I think that also kind of underscores that like these games from the from like 199791 and the next couple ones have like really solid like music and theme to them that like some of these older 90s traditional roguelikes just for whatever reason, just totally spaced on having.
10:17
So I think this is a good opportunity to kind of showcase that like, yes, the 90s roguelikes did have music and art and stuff to them.
Anything.
Anything we want to say more about Game Boy games before jumping systems here.
10:33
Well, fun fact about Cave noir, the Japanese name for Cave noir is Cave Noir just.
Outstanding.
What a what a title.
What a title.
Incredible.
Yeah, I don't I don't know if there's any any like trench coat wearing like Cold War spy isms going on in it, but yeah, there's definitely there's Emily caves, there's multi tile monsters, there's a hidden passageways.
10:59
It it feels really good to play, which is like very deceptive.
So anyway, while moving systems from the Game Boy to the Sega Genesis, we're going to we're going to inject, we're going to take you to the section of the Library of Congress that's just called the 90s.
11:19
And this is the the track Toe Jam Jammin from Toe Jammin Earl.
12:05
The.
12:29
The.
12:58
The.
13:28
You're listening to Toe Jam, jammin from the 1991 Sega Genesis game Toe Jam and Earl, and boy does this bring me back to memories of going to Blockbuster Video and looking on the back of the box and saying a game that's that's random every time you play it.
13:48
Why would anyone ever want to play something like that?
That doesn't make any sense.
Did either of you guys play play any toe jam and Earl growing up?
Hey, look, I'm not afraid to admit when my knowledge when when I'm when I'm insufficient in a particular realm of information.
14:07
So you know, I'm not ashamed to to ask what the hell is Toe Jam and Earl?
I've been hearing this name through my whole life.
I remember I was at PAX one year and a group of my friends were very excited.
14:23
Yo, they're they're remastering Toe Jam and Earl.
I was like, no idea.
So yeah, please illuminate us.
We we were a Nintendo household, so.
Oh dear, I mean I was I was a a multi console household little rich boy.
14:40
You can go up but the toe jam and Earl I believe I'm.
I'm willing to go so far as to say this is the first rogue light in that it is a real time two player Co-op.
14:57
How do you even describe this?
It better be two player with a name you know like that.
Yeah, I mean it is it is like a horizontal split screen like game of of the titular toe jam and Earl 2 space aliens who have from the planet Funkotron who have crashed landed on Earth and their spaceship is broken apart.
15:17
And you gotta, you gotta traverse these procedurally generated weird levels that are presumably Earth question mark, hunting around for your spaceship parts and avoiding weird cherubs with like pitchforks and like human tourists and things.
15:40
And you're like hiding in bushes and you're getting like birthday presents and water floaties and all the kind of standard trappings that you would find in a two player 19.
And is there a time limit?
I don't think there's a time limit that I believe there's a hunger clock, an explicit hunger clock in that your aliens will get hungry and I think suffer damage.
16:04
You know, as you're describing, so much of so much of what you're describing is in fact addressed and explained on the cover that I'm looking at.
Earl is is is chowing down on a hot dog toe jam who is wearing a medallion that says TJ has a little speech bubble that says jamming.
16:23
So I mean, it makes sense they'd be jamming because they're from Funkotron or whatever.
Interesting.
It does have the TJ on there.
I was like, how could you tell which one?
Is which Right.
Yeah.
And so like, you know, gives you the information, you look at it, you go who which one's toe jam OK, there.
Boom.
And there's Earl and what a deal.
Interesting, interesting.
16:38
And well, it sounds like it sounds like there's a very good reason for it to be randomized because, you know, you're searching for objects, but the actual location of those objects is going to be different every time you play it.
And and it is cooperative.
So that's kind of that's a fun concept.
16:54
Yeah, it is.
It is a very weird game in retro.
Or like it feels like at the time it just kind of came out of left field where it's like, what the hell It's.
Coming out of left field.
It came out of left field to me in 2015 when I was at PAX and I hadn't heard of it before.
That was the first time I heard about it, and I haven't stopped hearing about it since.
17:13
Outstanding.
But what do we think of the music?
I think this is like quintessential, Quintessential Genesis sound.
It's crunchy, it's thrashy, it's got that kind of raw element to it, and I think it's really good.
It's a shame that Will's not here because I think he would be really enjoying that bass line.
17:31
Oh my God the bass is so.
Good.
It reminds me of SIM City like 1 and some of the weird old like Mac games or stuff.
It reminds me of like my friends houses and like how cool it was to play other people's video games.
17:48
I mean, did you have that when you were a kid?
And you're just like, I just want to go to your house and play your games.
I don't actually want to play with you.
I just want to play Toe Jam and Earl on your console.
That's the only reason why I had.
Friends growing up, there you have it.
But but beyond just the like desire to play video games with them not being super accessible as a kid, you're you're so right, Colin, in that like they are, they were distinctly your games at your house, like a different environment.
18:15
And not only was the console different looking, not only was the controller physically different, but the games, of course, looked different and sounded different.
As we're discussing very exotic.
Yeah.
These these types of notes you were not hearing out of a SNES.
No.
Well, we'll, we'll hear something like that here in a minute.
18:33
But yeah, I think there is, there is.
I always think like there's this hotly contested debate between Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis music and they each, they each have their pros and cons.
I don't know why I feel more drawn to like the Sega Genesis tunes of like Streets of Rage or no one's ever heard of this game before.
18:51
But Granada, which I believe the composer for that game also went on to do the all the composing for the Dark Souls series.
But yeah.
But yeah, let's let's move on to another somehow, another 1990s Sega Genesis traditional roguelike game, if you can believe it.
19:13
This one comes to us from a year earlier.
This is a Fatal Labyrinth, floors one through 9.
19:55
You're listening to Fatal Labyrinth Floors One through 9 composed by E Fugu for the 1990 Sega Genesis, and I think in comparing this one to to Toe Jam and Earl.
20:15
So I guess maybe, I don't know.
Fatal Labyrinth I think has a lot of nostalgia factor for I I always see people posting live like, Oh my God, I, I loved playing this game growing up on the, the Sega Genesis and me checking it out on a, on a ROM.
20:33
So we're like, all right, let's let's give it a shot.
And I think the, the soundtrack, I'm like, OK, yeah, this is, this is pretty grooving.
And then I'm like, wow, it just that it just kept going, didn't it?
Yeah.
I mean, it's got a great baseline, Yeah, but I don't know if they like it's, it's a really good baseline and it just kind of keeps going and you're like, that's cool.
20:53
I feel like they could have thrown in like A twist here or there, except not just a dumb.
Thing yeah.
And like, especially this being like like AI was kind of looking at the the Zoom chat here and waiting to see who would tap out first of like it's a little repetitive.
21:13
And I don't know if I could really stand 99 dungeon floors of this in a row.
But for whatever reason, when I was playing it like I would like quit the game and then it would just like be playing in my head the whole rest of the day.
Yeah, I think it's better background video game music than it is just easy listening music.
21:31
Yeah.
Imagine getting into an elevator and hearing that.
Look here, I'm here to say Fatal Labyrinth.
That's like a that's like a very intense sounding name.
I was expecting like a greedy, like a really gritty, brutal situation.
I looked up some gameplay footage while we were listening.
21:47
This, this music is way too upbeat.
It's way, way too groovy it I feel like it does not match tonally at all.
And I thought, well, let me get a better sense of what the tone of this game is.
Let me see what the game over screen is and I'm listening to this.
Bam bam, bam, bam bam.
22:04
And as as Google images loads and the game over screen is all the morning villagers all gathered around your your grave with a big game.
Over bam bam bam bam bam bam.
And presumably, presumably there's different music for the game Over screen.
22:21
I would hope.
Yeah, I I have not gotten to the game over screen largely because this is one of those games that I save scum the crap out of because it has all of all of your favorite things about traditional rug likes in that there are hidden traps, extremely tedious enemies that put you to sleep for multiple turns and just like do like non-stop damage to you.
22:43
And, and like other like really tedious slow gameplay to it compared to something like our Lord and savior Cave Noir.
But I think that like, I, I could see that like if you grew up playing this game.
Yeah, the game over screen looks so morose.
23:00
Like, like this game has like a very interesting, like opening to it of like, like, oh, like you're you're leaving the town going into the dungeon kind of thing.
But it's so slow.
And like, I don't know, again, like if it was 1990 me, if it was 3 year old me playing this game, I'm like, Oh my God, like this is the greatest thing I've ever played.
23:19
And like especially if it's like the only game you have.
Weirdly enough, this game was also I think like a shared asset slash development with another.
If you can leave a third Sega traditional rogue like game called Dragon Crystal, that is is like for all intents and purposes like the same game.
23:38
I think Dragon Crystal from what I dabbled with, it plays better, but I don't know that the soundtrack is maybe as maybe it doesn't have it as ripping of the baseline.
But yeah, I think Fatal Labyrinth it definitely, I don't know, there's something about it that kept me coming back just to see like there's got to be something more to this.
24:01
And each time that I went back to him, like, OK, I I could see like thank God for I'll just say thank God for safe states.
That's all I'll say on the on that front.
Well.
Well, we, we depart the Sega Genesis and the, and the 90s.
24:16
Well, actually, actually, no, we're, we're going to come back to the 90s here in a little bit, but we're going to depart the Sega Genesis and come to our next game here, which is from the 2018 game Tangle Deep.
24:34
This is Mysteries of Time.
25:52
Yeah.
27:18
You're listening to Mysteries of time at the 2018 soundtrack to the game the traditional roguelike.
Again, Tangle deep and this is 1 where that someone had some when someone in the YouTube comments, one of our frequent commenters I'm going to again butcher this because that's the name of the game.
27:42
Rells Ray pointed out that one OC Remixer named Zircon did the music for this game as well as another traditional work like game Dungeon Man's.
I left out of my chair because I was like what do you do?
27:58
Either of you have have any experience with OC Remix before?
I don't know, but hopefully I'm going to be soon.
Wow OK for a long time I had two tracks by Zircon on my bike workout playlist.
28:15
One of them was in a remix from Speech of Rage 2 called Above Reason and then the other one was a remix from TMNT 4 called Wastewater Wipeout.
Both like S like S plus tier.
I don't know if like you call this chiptune remixing just like top top tier music and when you look at who else's contributing on this soundtrack.
28:36
So this is a game that was developed and published by 1 Zircon Andrew Aversa who was an OC Remix.
Wait, so Zircon is the composer?
Yes, Zircon is also the maker of the game, correct?
28:52
Yes, and this is like Tangle Beef, I think is a game that has like like mild like mixed reactions about like gameplay and just like all that kind of stuff, but looks and sounds amazing.
For yeah, I was watching on on my, you know, I was also watching a gameplay video of it while we were listening and it's gotten good sprites.
29:14
Yeah, like really good.
Like if you, if I hadn't said anything and you were listening to this and you're like, this sounds a lot like like secretive mana, then you might be right.
Because some of the other composers contributors to the soundtrack include one got again the pronunciation, Hiroki Kikuta from Secret of Mana 1, Grand Kirk Hope you might recognize from Goldeneye, and one Norharico Hibino, who helped contribute to the Metal Gear Solid 2 soundtrack along with Harry Griggs and Williams.
29:53
Wowee.
Kind of an All Star cast for for like this, this soundtrack that like you just be like, what is this kind of like, you know, traditional roguelike game on Steam and just scroll right past it.
And then not not having the opportunity to like kind of take in like just like the wonderful art production of this game.
30:14
It reminds me a lot of like the the soundtrack from like Shovel Knight, who's who's also a big OC remix person, Jake Kaufman, also known as Vert.
But yeah, I think that like so far, like my my DJ playlist has been like, you know, there's like some really good music and production value to traditional roguelikes that maybe we'll get to it some point.
30:40
But but yeah, I think had had our commenter on YouTube not pointed out that like, hey, by the way, this guy did the soundtrack for it, I would been like, what?
So I'm glad.
So thank you again, rels Ray for.
For Rels Ray, what a what a scholarly, gentle person.
30:57
Thank you very much for pointing that out.
Holy moly, how many amazing composers does one game need?
Apparently quite a few.
Yeah, I mean, sometimes they say less is more, but I think in this case it helps having some some absolute Titans of video game music to help you out with your soundtrack.
31:18
And it's not.
It's almost like, you know, he didn't even really need the help to begin with because like a lot of his other remix stuff is so good.
But I think it comes across as like.
Well, yeah, clearly, you know, he's got the clout to, like, call in some favors, some serious business, big hitters.
31:34
All right, well.
A lot of good transitions.
I feel like it it every time you thought it was done, it switched different instrument.
It's good.
Indeed, and that's always appreciated for, you know, long form video game soundtrack stuff like if you're going to be hearing it for a long time there, there better be some variety or you know, that core melody better be really good.
31:52
And in this case, kind of both Peru.
And this this makes me feel like this is like the good part of Super Nintendo music where like again, I don't know, it's a me problem, but like there's some parts of Super Nintendo music that sound like very muddy and just kind of like, I don't know, mushy.
32:08
But this like secret of mana Chrono trigger another like top tier Super Nintendo soundtrack.
This one feels like if this if this game had like released back then, like again, slam dunk cultural phenomenon like landing right in with there.
32:24
So I think that like, yeah, this game for for Tangle Deep is definitely worth checking out.
I think just from the soundtrack and production value in art assets alone almost.
Well with that, another game that has lots of really good art assets to it is is our next entry here.
32:45
This one is Angels from the game Moon Ring.
34:51
You're listening to the track Angels for the 2023 game Moon Ring, initially a solo dev effort by 1 Dean Carter, who you might remember as the Co creator of the Fable series who made Moon Ring.
35:09
And I believe overtime has a has brought in a small development studio to build this game that I think kind of skirts the line between something either like a traditional roguelike or an ultimate like where the game has.
35:26
So moon ring is like a like a static overworld map, but procedural dungeons.
And when you die, your whole progress doesn't reset your descent to the top of the dungeon, which a feature that I think I can kind of appreciate from some traditional roguelike games that that go super long and super deep that that I think could probably take some notes for.
35:48
But.
Oh, you can appreciate it.
It sounds like some wussy shit to me.
No, it sounds like a very practical, you know, quality of life sort of situation more than a quality of life situation.
Golly, what a frankly kind of dour soundtrack.
36:09
Yeah, this one I think is is very interesting because this game has has like this very like unnerving tone to it of like, oh, like I can't wait to go.
It has that same vibe of like the Nicolas Cage B movie, where, like, you know, everything on the perfect island is not as it seems kind of deal and of on this land that you're you're dreamless protagonist.
36:37
Wait, lives on.
There are these five gods that kind of rule rule the land of this.
This is the soundtrack for one of the the gods temples, the blind angels.
So this is the background music as you're going through through their temple and you know, you Curry favor with the gods to gain more powers and go through more dungeons and stuff.
36:55
But but maybe, maybe.
What if you wanted to rebel against those gods?
Well, you'd obviously need the moon ring.
Yeah, exactly.
And and what if you you said, well, you know, this is all well and good, but this isn't a this isn't a rope like this is an Ultima leg.
37:13
Why even include it in this podcast?
Well, gentle listener of discriminating taste, there is a new whopping $5 dungeon for this free to play solo asterisk dev game that is a 100 floor traditional rope like dungeon that they put in, which I think is a neat touch.
37:33
That's like, oh, you, you want your traditional work like bam, here you go.
Quit complaining.
But I think also serves as a nice donation mechanism to the to the developer of like.
Thanks for putting this thing out for.
The free game, yeah.
But also, but like Moon ring, I think is, is great 'cause like it has again, another game that's like really high production value for like these these super ancient design criteria of traditional roguelike games.
37:58
And like Moon Ring actually makes me really mad that like of how good it's like text interface is.
And just like the UI in general, like it's very like almost kind of like 1970s like vomit level of like colored spasm going on.
But like the UI is so good in this game and it's like the art style is so strong and like in Cogmind, you know, one of our top rated games for 2/3 of us.
38:25
It like you do a lot of typing in that game, You do a lot of typing in this game, but there's so much care put into how you type with like a controller and like instead of typing in like each individual word, you can just kind of like cycle through a word cloud of keywords.
38:41
That's I'm like, Oh my God, this is like, this is amazing.
This is like a genius way to kind of do this kind of text interface stuff.
So I absolutely had to shout out, like the the wonderful care of of joypad GamePad support, that that moon ring has gone well out of its way to put in.
39:01
Also, apparently Moon Ring 2's come out.
That's right, yeah.
There's there's a sequel to it coming out which.
Coming out, I mean, it's in early, very early development as of March.
So coming out in the nebulous future.
It has, yeah, been announced.
39:18
Very good.
Very good.
Yeah.
Moon Ring 2.
The Ringing Moon Ring 2.
I mean, presumably Electric Boogaloo.
Moon ring rain.
Oh yeah, moon ring Rain.
It's got a nice ring.
Never mind.
39:33
Anyway, very good.
Well, taking us, taking us, I guess maybe back to the 90s question mark for I believe our well, one.
I guess we have one more traditional roguelike game after this one.
39:50
They're not all traditional roguelikes tonight, but but there's a surprisingly a lot of them.
This next one is the outro song to Unreal World.
40:34
The.
40:53
That is the very powerful outro song to the 1992 traditional roguelike game Unreal World, which I believe has the The Guinness Book of World Records as the longest continually updated game period, let alone within roguedom.
41:14
I'm pretty sure it is like a game that has been continuously updated since 1992.
And you might say like, Oh well what about net hack or blah blah blah.
Not counting like forks, like software forks or anything like that.
I think it is like the same potential code base and this is the wild soundtrack to it as you exit the game, which, and I believe this is a Cree proverb but translated into Finnish with the developers doing all of the music and shouting in it.
41:51
The lyrics going, and I'm sure many people for this, but the, it's the lyrics of only when the last tree is felled, only after the last river was poisoned, only when the last fish is caught, only then will they realize that you can't eat money and then shout green, scream, girl, girl, shout boy son.
42:08
And then just shout, shout, shout, shout, shout, shout.
Yeah, that was in Finnish, he said.
Infant, yeah.
Yeah, Hell yeah.
Sign me up.
I'm, I'm going to be in that folk metal pit as soon as they add, you know, some electric guitars.
42:23
And very immediately I, I yeah, of course, of course it's Finnish.
Very, very familiar type of type of vocals to me, having consumed a lot of Finnish folk metal and that that bowing sound.
42:42
The old mouth harp.
That that is, that is an iconic sound.
I believe that's being produced by I had, I had to do a little bit of research to confirm by a, a jaw harp, which is like this little piece of metal that you hold in your, in your mouth and you kind of you also reading the Wikipedia about it, the end going, going, going, you know, and oh, love that.
43:02
That's a that's a wonderful little touch to put in the in the background.
Is that is that mentioned in the in the, in the Wikipedia article?
I was, I was doing like ridiculous, like Google searches, like the the instrument that makes the buoying noise.
You didn't just know it's.
It's also known as the Jews Harp, which is weird because it's not actually associated with Jews in any way.
43:22
It's just like a mistrans like mishearing of jaw jaw.
I see.
Yeah, jaw harp.
You play it with your jaw now I had.
A You put it in your mouth and you're like twang it.
The twang.
The jaw twang.
Previously I'd heard the term jaw harp and literally assumed that it was made from the jaw of an animal.
43:42
I'm like just 'cause I had that that folk metal Viking aesthetic in my brain.
Apparently it's like 4000 years old.
It's one of the oldest instruments.
It's one of the oldest instruments and this is one of the oldest in production games, so very fit.
43:59
Very fit it probably.
Developed around the same time as the jaw harp.
So far, this is the first, this is the first track that we've played play all the way through.
Now, part of that is because it's short, but it was engaging enough for us to to listen to the whole Dang thing.
What the?
44:14
Hell was happening, but then it was so close to being done.
Oh, sure, what what what is what is going on in this thumbnail?
Here we've got what appears to be an actual photograph that's been like bit crunched a little bit of.
I think that's like an actual screenshot of the game.
I well, the, the, the game itself is like this, like even by traditional roguelike standards is very weird where it is.
44:35
It's like a, it's like a top down.
Like a lot of traditional roguelike games have like a vision cone that's like circular around the player.
This one is like the screen is cut like a 90° chunks because of like your vision is like 90° only forward.
It's, it's very strange.
44:51
It's very unique and it is effectively like Bronze Age Minecraft in Finland, but in like top down tile format.
But you're like, your character is in like the top right corner and the portrait is just like an actual picture of like a man dressed up in the woods of Finland.
45:11
Yeah, I'm pretty sure a lot of like the the like character portrait art for this game is just like the developers and their friends that had just like a photo shoot one day.
But like, yeah, like the the thumbnail for this track is is amazing because it's just like a guy with a spear encountering a a shirtless dude with an axe in like the in the finished Tyga that like, yeah.
45:38
Scandinavia is is truly an incredible place.
I have to read a couple a couple bullet points here from the soundtrack 'cause I think this just kind of underscores it and the enhanced Unreal World soundtrack brings you the game's music, plus three selected spin off songs along the way.
45:56
Soundtrack features music composed and performed by the very devs themselves, Sami Marinen the creator and Erka Yumhis, the Co designer between the period of 2013 through 2023.
46:11
With all the tracks mainly played with authentic traditional instruments including human voice, this is a primeval musical journey into the far north.
The soundtrack ends with a 41 minute long shamanistic frame drum driven journey which can also be looped and works nicely as an independent background music from any kind of meditative sessions.
46:32
Don't make games like this anymore, except when they do because they've been making it for 30 years.
They don't start making games like this anymore maybe.
Yeah, yeah, good luck trying to pitch this to to Microsoft or Xbox.
Hey, can you make a a strange finish survival game with a weird tribal chance and and jaw harp music?
46:54
AAA budget right there.
Still $11.00 on Steam.
I mean the game on Real World on Steam goes on sale for like 2 bucks every so often, but I saw that the the soundtrack go on sale.
I'm like OK I'm going to get it.
I listened to the whole 41 minute song bit and it's it's as great as you think it would be for like tribal drums and like weird forest chanting.
47:20
Oh sure.
No, I, I can, I, I certainly am aware of that appeal.
When I was on the 70,000 tons of metal crews this this year at the beginning of the year, I went to this one set which was not a Finnish folk metal band, but a, a band from Estonia called Metastole.
47:41
And they were performing, I think it was, I think it's their first album like in full.
And there are big sections of that album which you know, are no, there's no electric guitars.
It's all, you know, traditional analogue instruments, grandpa's guitars and, and, and wooden objects and stuff like that.
47:58
And there is a certain a certain vibe, a certain atmosphere that that type of music can set and it really transports you to a different state of mind.
Dare I say it?
So 40 minutes though.
48:15
When does that play during the game?
I don't think it's in the game.
I think it's just like it's.
Just a bonus track.
Right.
I think it's a bonus track for the soundtrack which.
They had to fill out the CD.
Right, right, right.
I mean, that was that was probably the principal draw for me anyway.
But but yeah, definitely worth checking out the soundtrack for that.
48:33
Well we as we leave Finland we go right back into Finland for another finish.
Soundtrack to a non traditional roguelike game.
This is Beat of the Cosmos from Noita.
50:18
None.
50:29
You're listening to Beat of the Cosmos from Noita previous episode.
And yeah, I as soon as I had put in the the unreal world Finnish music, I'm like, you know what we got to we got to have another Finnish TuneIn here as well.
50:45
And I remember on our episode.
Another one that includes the.
Jaw harp as well.
Yes, crucially.
Hell yeah, give me that.
Boing, Boing, boing.
And.
Gosh, what a what a what a tune that really kind of sets the sets the mood for a weirdly chaotic and mystical.
51:05
I think the beat beat of the cosmos with AK here is just yes, that's that's exactly what we're looking for.
The We mentioned it in our Noita episode, the the in theory three-part documentary on the the making of the music behind this game, where soundtrack here is done by the Finnish folk psychedelic funk band from Grotto and the They say it's a three-part series, but there's only two parts available on YouTube.
51:33
I don't know when the third parts come out.
Well, yeah, we, I believe we mentioned that in our episode and sorry to tell you listeners, the third entry has not appeared yet, unfortunately.
Now as as I as I just mentioned used to listening to a lot of Finnish folk metal, but this is less a fusion of folk and metal and more of a fusion of folk and like surfer music like at times it sounded like.
52:03
Finished folk funk.
We were I was ready to, you know, catch a wave, what have you.
Of course, Noida.
What a what a what a game, what a time.
As I mentioned, I think a few, several episodes ago, I, I spent quite a bit more time with Noida after we covered it and it is, it's a, it's a trip and that includes the soundtrack.
52:26
Yeah, you went back and beat it, didn't you?
Well, no, unfortunately I have made it.
I've made it to the, the regular final boss, the, the first final boss, if you will, twice.
52:44
And I, I'm telling you like 1% health left.
I had them down to 1%.
Like there was barely anything left in that bar, that health bar.
And I got got and then the first time I fought them, I teleported myself into lava on accident.
53:01
And so, yeah, definitely a chaotic cosmic situation for sure.
You got annoyeded, I got.
Annoyeded.
I got annoyed idea what you're talking about.
I'd say OK anyway.
So yeah, what what a deal.
53:18
What a deal from Grotto.
Yeah, and I think in that characters that that that documentary is just it's so emblematic of of like the style of the music where I believe they said it like it was largely improvised, which what better way for a a rogue, I believe it style game.
53:38
Oh, good point.
Yeah, and very on brand for for sure, for sure.
Well, this this next track needs no introduction.
So I'll just, I'll just ask you to stay a while and listen.
54:55
The.
55:32
You are staying a while and listening to Tristram Village from Diablo 1/19/97 and boy yeah, that that intro chord there on the guitar just kind of you know exactly where you are when you hear that, I feel like.
55:55
Yeah, truly, because I never played Diablo 10.
Well, you know where you are from Diablo 2, I guess.
Yeah, Yeah.
Thank you.
Thanks for going with us on that one, Colin.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Yeah, but I mean is in Diablo 2, isn't the soundtrack for when you go to Tristram the same song?
56:16
It's pretty much, it's very similar, the same.
It's got the same music melody.
Right.
Yeah, thank you.
Yo, first of all, for a period of time, this was the hold music if you called Blizzard.
Secondly, Diablo was the first game I can remember hearing about that was randomized my buddy.
56:43
And like, this is like an elementary school.
He's telling me, yo, there's this game Diablo.
I've been playing it at my dad's place because of course, you know, his parents were divorced.
So he only had the cool gaming computer at one of the houses.
And, and I've been playing this game and oh, you wanted this Dirk, this Dang Dirk dirty, this Darkest Dungeon dungeon and all this crazy shit's going on.
57:04
There's gore and blood everywhere.
You got to fight this guy called the butcher.
He's got to try and butcher blades.
All these corpses hanging everywhere.
I'm like, Oh my God, this sounds so intense.
And then, you know, the other big point that he made when he was describing this game to me is that, and depending on when you play it, the levels are different because of course, the RNG for generating the map is based off of the date in the computer in the computer's calendar.
57:28
And I that that kind of blew my mind.
Like not only are you going to this like horrific hellscape to go do battle with the forces of evil, but also the labyrinth is different every time you enter.
It's incredible.
And for some reason he didn't bother at any point explaining this.
57:46
He didn't bother mentioning it was an isometric game or even bothering to describe what the actual graphics were like.
And in my brain I just assumed like, well, I was playing like Tomb Raider at the time on my computer.
So it was like, yeah, it must be like fully 3D, like low Poly baloney.
58:03
And then anyway, when I finally got around to playing it, obviously I knew better.
But I played Diablo one after I played StarCraft.
And even at the time installing Diablo, I thought, yo, this is an old game.
Yo, this is a tiny game because it installed like that.
58:19
Like nothing like it was the the IT was.
It was over in a flash anyway.
I've played a bit of it recently and I don't think it's just the Rose colored graph glasses, which are an item in the game.
Great loot table in Diablo.
58:36
I don't think it's just the Rose colored glasses.
I think it holds up.
I'm pretty sure.
I'm pretty sure it holds up.
Yeah, I mean like Diablo 2 like unquestionable 10 out of 10 game and people again a.
Lot of Diablo too.
Yeah, I don't know if.
58:52
My mom would have let me buy in 1997 a game called Diablo that with a guy called the Butcher and lots of blood and gore and.
No, no, don't worry, Mom.
There's a kindly old man who's like the, you know, kind of the the head of the town and he hangs out and he presides over and he's a nice guy.
59:10
He only charges you 100 gold pieces to tell you what your items are.
Yeah, I think I had to.
I think I bought Diablo 2 with my own money.
I remember I remember hearing about Diablo, one from my very religious Christian friend who lived down the street from me, who was like, it was, it was very, it felt like very taboo for him to be playing and showing off.
59:36
He's like, you got to check this game out.
My dad doesn't know that I'm playing it, but it's called Diablo.
And it looked like at the time the scariest thing I'd ever seen in my life.
And I was like, I don't know that I should be looking at this Diablo.
One is the path to the devil and away from Christ.
But but it's, it feels like it has like a very pro Christian message to it, 'cause you're going, you're beating up the demons.
59:58
Precisely.
You are.
You're casting spells though.
That's.
Not yeah, that's a big problem.
Not me, I only play as warrior.
Of course, of course you wouldn't dare even look at a scroll of Spartans.
I can't read or.
You wouldn't even dare attempt to understand what's on that magical.
1:00:17
Fireball scroll I give a old man who knows how to read.
The game has both, anyway.
Yeah, well, the actual music, great hub music.
I mean, come on.
It's 5 minutes of like varied, interesting composition that like, of course, you know, they're working with that, the core melody and kind of sound, but they're doing all sorts of interesting stuff.
1:00:40
There's that mysterious whistle.
Blaze.
I love the mysterious whistle bling bling.
Like incredible.
And then you know each main instrument, both the main instruments get a solo section.
The oboe gets to shine.
1:00:56
The guitar goes crazy towards the end.
Love it, love it.
Yeah, if if the YouTube comments are to to be believed, and 90% of the time they're not.
This comes to us from from Blizzard sound genius Matt Uleman, who at the time I think was maybe 22 or 23 when making this, which is like mind blowing because if the if the internet's to be believed, the only other game that he worked on prior to this was Justice League Task Force for 1995, Sega Genesis.
1:01:30
And then went on to do the music for Diablo, sound design for StarCraft, music for Diablo 2, music for World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade, Torchlight, Diablo 3, all of the expansions for Diablo 3, Torchlight 3, Diablo 2 Resurrected.
1:01:46
Like, I mean, he could have just stopped at Diablo in StarCraft and it would have been just been like, all right, crown him the royalty's here.
Yeah, so it sounds like he's probably the guy to ask.
I've, I've been known to sometimes ask people working at Blizzard booths if they could tell me what the weird.
1:02:06
There's a piece of sound design where when you click on the Terran building, the Academy where all of the like ghosts go to train the, the psychic warriors.
And presumably it's a very intense training regiment because when you click on it, there's like a little marching band sound.
It's like.
Burn, burn, burn.
1:02:21
And then you hear this blood curdling scream, which I understand is that's from like a famous sound pack of some kind.
So it's like not like Blizzard invented it.
But I've been known to ask Blizzard employees like now what's going on there?
Are they are they torturing the students?
1:02:37
Is that some kind of like intense gene therapy?
I need to maybe try to track down this fellow and send them an e-mail and ask what the lore is behind the the Academy soundtrack.
But hey, now here I am talking about a totally different game starting to take us so far afield.
Well, importantly, I mean, like we've all been there in your final exams and you're just kind of like looking up and like screaming into the sky, I think.
1:03:00
Well, I, I believe that is the the Howie scream, not to be confused with the Wilhelm scream, the Howie Long scream that I believe comes from the 1980 film The 9th Configuration.
So former NFL fighter Howie Long might give us that.
1:03:16
But yeah, I think it's just like a a canned scream sound effect that they use and then got the license too.
And then we're just like 100%.
Yeah, that's the that's the one.
That's the one.
I remember hearing it also in the John Waters film serial Mom, Importantly, I'll send you all that clip later.
1:03:36
Lots of.
Lots of stim packs in that one, I'm sure.
Yeah, so you might again people slamming their brakes on the highway.
Oh my God, this podcast on roguelike and roguelite or whatever we call these games dipping in to action RPG real time games don't belong here.
1:03:54
Well, we're here to correct you, gentle and wise listener in that Diablo one, originally a fork from the legendary early 90s traditional roguelike freeware shareware game Ang Band that the people at Blizzard were like, you know, what if instead of like turn based and like bad, we made this good and we have Diablo and its legacy as a result.
1:04:24
Literally like kicking the kicking the ball on getting started with the action RPG genre.
Like I don't think it existed before this.
So we have we have them to think for that.
But yeah, I think like love this tune.
The the intro guitar theme from Dwarf Fortress sounds very inspired from this.
1:04:44
Yeah, I was gonna say it.
It reminded me a lot of Dwarf Fortress, which feels weird because I'm sure that it's really that Dwarf Fortress reminds me of this, right?
But yeah.
I've heard Dwarf Fortress more recently.
And very I, I had to go back into my Google Doc and take a note down of Led set love Led Zeppelin album #4 vibes a very like twangy but like mysterious and foreboding fantasy guitar, acoustic guitar which was playing in the the lunchroom the other day before me.
1:05:14
I'm like, yeah, this does sound like Diablo music, doesn't it?
Here you have it.
All right, up next on our playlist tonight is another folksy, kind of whimsical music track coming to us from the game Shogun Showdown.
1:05:36
This is Hibiku wastelands. you're listening to Hibiku wastelands from the side scrolling, I guess one-dimensional deck builder question mark None ninja fighting roguelike game Shogun showdown composed by Oscar the Mungdemelo, a game that I've been lobbying will to play relentlessly.
1:07:16
That that I think he took one look at was like, I don't know, but wow, yeah, I think the soundtrack for this game is really good.
And I want to say that basically this whole game is a solo dev effort outside.
Yeah, you know, it's a really good soundtrack.
1:07:32
Do you know this, fellas?
It's actually all 8 bit.
Is it?
Not at all.
That's what the wiki says though, and that can't possibly be correct.
That's obviously totally wrong.
Wow, they're doing some tech wizardry to get those, those that metal guitar there that heavy metal sound there in the end.
1:07:51
No, I don't know.
I don't know where they're getting that.
I, I surely there's some some 8 bit components, but hey, that sounds mighty fine.
I was trying to look this up while while it was playing what, what is that iconic string instrument sound that is featured in so much samurai media?
1:08:10
Does anyone know off the top of their head?
So maybe some kind of man to Lynn?
No, that's wrong.
A.
Subset.
But it sounds like Oscar de Mundemello Mundogemello knows a thing or two about it.
1:08:26
Yeah, quite intriguing, quite intriguing.
And I do appreciate that there is that sort of like up to tick in energy at like the, you know, 2 what the the 2 1/2 minute.
Mark, I was just about to say, all right, maybe time to like fade it out.
And then the battle, right?
And then the.
Guitars we got to keep listening, we got.
1:08:42
To keep listening, which I can imagine, you know, actually playing the game, which is actually rather exciting.
You're sitting there because I believe this is a turn based combat game.
You know, you're considering your move and then, oh, suddenly, you know, the energy really kind of pitches up as as the new instrument is introduced.
1:09:00
Sounds sounds groovy.
Yeah, this is this is very much a ninja combat game where like what if into the Breach, but in a single filed line.
And it's like half of a almost like a a like a flowing like ninja combat dancing simulator in a in a way, it's really cool.
1:09:19
Like it's.
Ninja or samurai?
Ninja.
Well, I feel like you're fighting samurai.
I don't know like.
OK, I, I assume that, you know, hey, most video games, if you got a samurai, a ninja's also going to show up at some point.
So fair to assume both.
1:09:36
I, I did a school project when I was a wee lad on the history of samurai and my, my, my board, my, my little standee display that I was presenting at the IT wasn't a science fair, but like, I guess history fair.
1:09:53
I don't know.
It featured a lot of great photographs and everything.
My dad got me in touch with a with a samurai historic historical expert that I got to speak with on the phone.
And of course, my favorite part of my my whole display for this topic was the inclusion of some Lego samurai figures tastefully assorted in a little action scene which I cannot believe anybody let me bring into my middle school.
1:10:21
Ridiculous.
Absurd and all that to say, I love the theme, I love the soundtrack and but I'm sure the gameplay I'd be too much of A bonehead to understand.
I mean, I, I feel like Into the Breach has kind of like a lot going on to it.
You would think like simplifying that down to just A1 dimensional plane would be like very reductionist, but it's actually like still very crunchy, but not overwhelmingly so.
1:10:46
It feels, it feels very well balanced in that role.
Interesting, interesting.
All right.
And, and just from like a raw thematic standpoint, I mean, the, the one lane one-on-one samurai duel is, is very appropriate, I feel like.
Oh yeah, well the transition of folk to metal for from Shogun Showdown continues with our soundtrack for this for this evening, where we're transitioning more into some metal tunes with revisiting a previous episode here.
1:11:19
This next track is Sakura Pink Inferno from AK Axolotl.
1:12:44
You're listening to Sakura Pink Inferno from previous episode of the podcast on here.
AK Axolotl acts.
Act Act.
Not AK47 AC dash axolotl.
AK axolotl is probably, I think, the best way to describe it.
1:13:02
To say it, I should say.
Coming to us from composer Jose Mora, who's done a few other games under his belt.
Jose Mora, I'd like to hear more of that.
You get the idea.
Anyway, Mora, his music.
Yeah.
So as I mentioned during our AK Axolotl episode, I'd be playing AK Axolotl, I'd be listening to a podcast or I'd be listening to my own music.
1:13:24
Every time I got to this level with this track, I would mute whatever I was listening to and listen to the end game music.
Too Good, love it.
Short, sweet.
But in that 1 1/2 minute period, there's like tons of progression that that that synth in the middle there just keeps going up, up, up up until it hits those high notes and oh, a beautiful melody, beautiful progression.
1:13:48
And then at the end you get some nice guitar riffs.
It does have like a lot of really good like symphonic metal inspiration to it.
And what the last time when we covered Axolotl for the podcast, it was like late, late November 2023 and I'm looking through like the patch notes from then.
1:14:05
It's just like content has been added.
They, I believe my recollection of our episode is that we were extremely, we were naysayers.
Well, well, well, there was that, but also like we were looking at their road map and we were scoffing.
1:14:20
I, I feel like we weren't super rude, but I think that, I think the implication we were implying that, yeah, they're not going to do any of this stuff.
They're not going to stick with this game.
They they they kicked it out the door and you know, it's good enough moving on to their credit, they have stuck with it.
1:14:36
I have gone back, I've played this game and it is much improved and there's a bunch more content and I I think they've really turned it into a game that you know, is, is maybe not worth revisiting all with an entire new episode.
But I think every it's definitely worth, worth revisiting for players.
1:14:56
And it's it's it's pretty, it's pretty impressive.
And I've even gone so far as to like play some of the optional modes, which I thought was pretty engaging.
They fixed a lot of our complaints and they added a whole lot of stuff, including like brand new biomes and brand new bosses.
1:15:13
And but they kept the song.
My favorite song in the game.
Well the the metal train continues as we visit our our last traditional Rd. like of of the the playlist this evening.
This next one here is Storm of the Phomorians from Quasimorph.
1:16:13
I.
1:16:59
You're listening to Storm of the Phomorians or Flowros Phase Three from the traditional roguelike game Quasimorph.
This is a game that I think released in early access to kind of like mixed reviews, importantly composed by Yevgeny Zorovsky.
1:17:18
Zorovsky and I think quasimorph kind of like released to kind of like men to middling reviews and it's like crawled its way back up into relevance of like wow, actually like there's this is like kind of dope.
If I had to describe it, it'd be kind of like a single player XCOM like extraction shooter and like the the title theme here that we're that are not title theme, but the theme that we're playing here is like there are these like mutated like monster slash eldritch horror gods throughout the solar system where different planets have like different like gosh, what is it like mythological, like monsters that I think evolved throughout the course of your playthrough.
1:18:03
And I think this is like the most evolved version of the the monster Flowros, who I think it's like a Sumerian themed like eldritch God.
But like other planets have ones from like Greek mythology and like like ancient Arabic mythology and other things like that.
1:18:20
It's like, it's it's very it's very unique in that regard.
Plays interesting.
Lots of lots of like heal your broken bones with like this like dirty bandage you fell on the floor while like extracting out of the OR like, yeah, either doing a mission in this spaceship here or assaulting the space station.
1:18:39
And very interestingly, you can choose to to either take on the contract of the the faction that's doing like a defensive operation or you can be on the faction that's doing the offensive, which is neat.
Yeah, it's a game that I've considered picking and it's definitely, it's certainly still on my list of games and I would consider choosing for the podcast.
1:19:04
I liked as we were listening to that very intense, very metal song, the image that was up just kind of like hanging out in the bottom left was just Stock Exchange.
It's like, yeah, I'm gonna listen to that.
That yeah, some good stock trading music.
1:19:20
Got to look at my stocks.
Turning music now.
Yeah.
What what, what a lot of fun.
Like little details in that obviously, you know, like rocking guitar riffs, cool, interesting progression, but then also just some some some nice little flourishes, little details, use of sound effects kind of fun I do.
1:19:41
Like the the knife sharpening sound like.
Yeah, I noticed that too.
That was.
So that that those nice little touches like that, there was a sound effect that really kind of the track lost me when at about the three minute mark.
I don't know if the listeners are actually going to hear that, but at the three minute mark there is like a like some kind of mechanical sound.
1:20:02
What was that?
It sounded like a 2 stroke like engine, like trying to start.
It sounded like a weed whacker.
You're not, you're not thinking of like the the double No, no, no.
Absolutely.
Are you kidding me?
Excuse me.
Stop the podcast.
Andrew, do you know what drums sound like?
1:20:18
Do I know what a double bass like metal drum set sound setup is?
I I did, I assure you that is not.
That is playing, of course throughout the track, whereas the sound effect that I'm referring to is at the three minute mark specifically.
Are you sure it's not the blast beats Andrew?
1:20:37
Yeah, I'm sure.
Now this is a cult, a guitar.
It makes this a twangy.
Sound, I appreciate that.
Now we didn't quite the the the the the the drum work was very nice.
I, I should, I should, I should add we didn't quite get to like full like death metal like, but like there were there were a little little bits of that sprinkled throughout, which I appreciate.
1:20:58
So anyway, I'm going to have to play the game to figure out what that 2 stroke engine start up sound is.
Well, up next we're going to, we're going to continue our more kind of like hero metal theme of of Metalism with a very aptly titled Metal Hero from Roboquest.
1:22:02
I.
1:23:05
You're listening to Metal Hero from Roboquest, composed by notable music artist Noise Scream, who has composed for a couple couple other games, notably My friend Pedro.
1:23:23
I think is is one of them I think like a banana shooting action game, but this is this is one of your classic cases of like this game being just like an absolute awesome title theme to this game that you are just a yellow mechanical robot man.
1:23:40
Well, there's other classes, but yeah, you are mechanical robot man helping small teenage girl in the desert fight through to to the end for stuff and this this game plays super well.
This is one that I've I have like on my titular like Andrew Musk playlist of like like almost kind of like doom, doom infinite style FPS, just like really fast, flowy action shooting to it.
1:24:10
Great soundtrack and one of those.
People say that the sound doesn't look quite like it matches the visual aesthetic.
The visual aesthetic is a little cartoony.
I'm surprised.
I was surprised when I looked it up and I saw the the graphics for it.
Actually.
1:24:25
I need to be darker, grittier, more, maybe more like actual, like Doom.
It feels very colorful and almost like almost like Borderlands Y, but not in an annoying way.
It's like Borderlands a little bit, but then Doom gameplay.
1:24:41
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Also you you said there was noise, noise scream.
I think it it looks like a noise cream to me.
We all scream for noise.
Scream.
Naturally, this is this is.
Yeah, another.
1:24:57
You're absolutely on the right track there, Scott.
Your intuition is absolutely correct because this is another game that's on my list of show games.
And I mean, this is just another reason for me to play it.
I didn't realize that it had such a groovy soundtrack, like Groovy's not the right.
1:25:15
We're not literally groovy.
There's not some kind of like bass groove going on.
But obviously you got that metal influence very clearly.
That track that we just listened to fits into the, for me, into the dark synth genre, which is, you know, definitely, obviously takes cues from heavy metal.
1:25:37
Yeah.
It definitely brought to mind like, you know, Carpenter, Brute, Pertubator, those sorts of artists and which of course, you know, all people will know from Hotline Miami, the Hotline Miami soundtrack.
Cool.
Yeah, I agree, though I, while we were talking, just talking, I, I agree that it sounds feels like a little bit of a mismatch to the the game's visuals.
1:26:01
But hey, you know, I I listen to, you know, dark synth regardless of what activity I'm doing.
So, I mean, that's not too much of A stretch for me personally, All right?
Up next is a game where soundtrack is the game and the game is the soundtrack.
1:26:18
Up next is Mausoleum Mash from Crypt of the Necro Dancer.
1:27:12
Music.
1:27:42
None.
You're listening to Mausoleum Mash from Crypt of the Necro Dancer, composed by 1 Danny Baranowski, who you might remember from Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac, Cave Story, Cortex Command, Nuclear Throne, Desktop Dungeons, Glitter Mitt and Grove, Cadence of Hyrule and Rift of the Necro Dancer.
1:28:08
Yeah, I mean, just every time that I boot up this game oh and this Krypton attack dancer just had his 10 year anniversary not too long ago, which got me to to fire it up again be like Oh yeah, like this I.
Think really was that old?
I know.
1:28:27
It's been around.
That means it's a traditional rogue life now because it's so old.
But traditional rogue life?
Yeah, exactly.
There's a there's a DDR machine at my office and as as all tech offices do, and I thought multiple times were like, hmm, how can I hook up my steam deck in such a way to play crypto?
1:28:48
The necro dancer on that thing.
I'm sure there's a way someone has figured it out, But but yeah, this is definitely a game.
I I every time I fire it up, I just this is the, I think the title theme and stage, like world one stage 3 theme as well.
1:29:04
Every time I boot it up, I just like sit there and just like listen to the to that intro baseline for like at least a minute.
It's like so so good.
I I assume we're going to cover this game at some point.
It's it's kind of a what what what is the phrase you always use Scott A definite stay tuned stay tuned and a half.
1:29:25
Stay tuned and a half.
Folks who are upgrading it from from one stay tuned to stay tuned in 3/4 My God.
Yeah.
Oh, even well, I know it's an inevitability and I'm I'm so worried that we're going to get to that episode and I'm going to be the negative Nancy.
1:29:45
I won't get into it.
But like, I booted the game up again and was like, yo, I'm enjoying this infinitely less than I remember.
What is what is going on?
What's wrong with me?
Because yeah, the soundtrack is bumping for sure.
And it is, I mean, is it is it too hard to call it?
1:30:04
It's a it's a classic of sorts.
It's a it's a classic rhythm game at this point, I feel like.
And yet I had not a great experience reinstalling it.
Hopefully that is that was a just a total weird, out of left field, atypical thing.
1:30:22
And when I have again, fingers crossed.
Yeah, well, I mean, there's there's always the Bard mode where you can just play in just pure straight up turn based mode and won't have to worry about the beat at all.
Should do so desire.
So that's just beard beard scratch mode.
Indeed.
Yeah.
1:30:39
What kind of defeats the whole conceit of the game, you would think, Yeah.
Sure, but hey, what What accommodating doubts to put in such an option?
True.
Yeah, Yeah, I'm, I'm very tempted to mix in.
Well, I guess if you're listening to this, you'll you'll determine whether or not if I actually have mix in the the shopkeeper singing in tune with the music.
1:31:02
Yeah, I was going to bring that up and I thought, now I save it for the episode.
Save it for the episode.
Yeah.
Famously, the shopkeep sings along with the soundtrack.
And not only is that fun and cool and sounds neat like it, it's, it's, it's, it's a boon to the soundtrack.
It also like is a hint in the game, like hey, come this, come this way.
1:31:22
You can hear, you can hear the shopkeep.
I I know that I'm close to the the the shop.
And you can the siren song, the siren song of the shop.
And he has a beautiful voice.
Well, coming back to our our sort of dark synth angle here is dark synth synth wave question mark.
1:31:42
Up next is Solo Nobre Must Fall, the theme from Brigador.
1:33:26
You're listening to Solo Nobre Must Fall, the main theme from Brigador and I Feel Like This.
And this was composed notably by Makeup and Vanity Sets.
Also known as Matthew Pussly.
1:33:41
Another no, no, no, no, no no.
It's another classic duo, just like Toe Jamming or Earl.
I am learning just now that makeup and vanity set is not two people.
And I'm I'm kind of shocked, honestly.
But yeah, of course, makeup and vanity set incredible, great.
1:34:01
A mainstay of the dark sin genre, one of the big, I don't know, five.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not quoting that.
But I would assume if they got to be like the top five for that genre and they're out here, they're doing so much work.
1:34:17
They're doing soundtracks for podcasts, They're doing soundtracks for video games.
They're doing soundtracks for presumably some film.
I would.
Think yeah, kind of all over the place.
And I remember, like, noodling around in this game or something.
1:34:33
And then, like, I think Andrew, you poked in and was like, hey, wait a minute.
Isn't that, like, wait, make a vanity set?
Like, have you gone to one of their concerts in person?
I forget.
Sadly not.
OK, I have, I have not there.
I mean I don't know how active he he is.
1:34:51
Is that correct?
Matthew Pussly Out based out of Nashville.
Based out of Nashville, I don't know how often Matthew is hitting the road and touring, but you know, definitely on.
I'm on the lookout for that for sure.
I've I've been to I've been to some other big, you know, dark sin shows, but not never make up and vanity set.
1:35:11
And yeah, Brigadore is an interesting game.
Also would like to cover it at some point.
Yeah, I've added it to the potential future games list.
I remember Scott, it made us listen to the music from it at some point before made us and I was like, oh that sounds great, this game looks cool, we should play it and then immediately forgot that it existed until this moment.
1:35:36
And that is the curse of Brigadore, Colin.
Honestly.
No one can remember the name of this game.
Yeah.
Colin you should you should dive deep into the multi multi audiobook series they have on the the lore behind the game and and deep dives of of production.
1:35:57
Which for reference, for those of you who've never heard of this game or did hear about the game but then forgot the name of the game, it is a mech warrior type situation which I.
I still I still listen to the Mechwarrior 2 soundtrack from like 1997.
That shit slaps.
That's so good.
1:36:13
I need to make you guys listen to it so you can tell me if it's good or just nostalgia, but I'm pretty sure it's good.
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean I think like I listen to like the entire soundtrack for Brigadore, like on a constant loop while I'm coding at work.
And it is just, it is so perfect for what the game is.
1:36:30
I'm not entirely convinced that Brigador is a rogue, rogue like or light in the in most respects.
There's there's some kind of like modes that you can you can make it do that.
And yeah, I feel like from from Andrew's perspective of like being like a negative Nancy coming back to the game, I'm like, man, I I hope, I hope it's aged better since like the first time I played it.
1:36:52
It's so it's so close to being like the perfect game for me where I have some bullet points, my Google doc here describing it as a John Carpenter StarCraft just for like the gritty, the gritty aesthetic and the music and and all that.
The the devs were supposed to have a, a demo for their like Brigador 2 called Brigador killers.
1:37:13
That was supposed to be out this latest, I think spring or summer Steam next fest like demo festival.
They didn't make it in time.
So they're targeting this upcoming winter 2025 for showcasing that.
And I have, I have high hopes 'cause that game has been like in like development hell for so long.
1:37:31
And Brigador 1 is like, it's such a strong game with such interesting and unique design choices for like how you lob shots over buildings and things like that.
Just like the art style, everything about it is, is so interesting.
1:37:48
One of the Steam reviews I had to write down here is about Brigador says it's space banana company wants to reclaim space Cuba after the death of space Fidel Castro.
So that gives you any indication of what you're in for there.
But but up next for continuing some synth wave, dark synth wave aesthetic here as well as some some mercenary action will be the track Hypernoma from Synthetic.
1:39:19
Music.
1:40:15
You're listening to the track Hypernoma from Synthetic Legion Rising I guess.
Synthetic 1, composed by Effie Tozan among others, listed on the credits for the soundtrack.
This game is super dope.
This game is like the one game that I love playing but have to stop because I get really bad headaches while playing it where I don't.
1:40:39
I'm sure there's a toggle for this somewhere.
Where like anti.
Seizure mode.
It's it's like the combination of like flashing and like loud like banging sound effects and stuff that like is very effective in the game.
And for whatever reason, I don't know if it's just like a certain time of day that I usually wind up playing it, but like I. 2:30 in the morning.
1:41:01
And like the the SIM soundtrack is is like blasting non-stop the.
City is asleep, but you're awake.
This game has a really fun like old like very it's it's a very clean design aesthetic, but also it feels like simultaneously like very modern and also very like 80s action arcade classic.
1:41:21
Indeed, and and synthetic critically spelled with the K Pretty important is a like Brigador top down shooter situation.
And it looks like something out of the 90s.
But because it's a modern game, like they didn't have to downscale the graphics so much.
1:41:39
And so it's like crisp, not pixelated, but still 2 dimensional presentation.
And just like that track, which is, you know, very blade, very the matrix that driving beat is just relentless.
1:41:56
It feels like gameplay.
Really.
High school, Like, yeah, I learned about the concept of electric music.
But in the best.
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly.
Like deep nostalgia.
There is so, so for my cycling workouts, one of them that I do is called an FTP test, a functional threshold power test where like every every minute, the power threshold like goes higher and higher and higher and higher until like you just your legs give out like you can't push any longer.
1:42:25
This is on that that cycling workout playlist for me because it is it is like the most focusing like in the zone, just like like punch it music that I have like this among among other ones.
But God, yeah, it is it is so good.
1:42:41
And then like especially like the gameplay in synthetic is also like very interesting where like you would like a lot of games have like active reload mechanics that are super annoying, But this one like feels very necessary And like not like it's trying to be like very simulationist with like gunplay, like, oh, I got to make sure to like have all the mags with all the right ammo and stuff.
1:43:01
But like it does, it does a good job of balancing that with like Arcady shooting action and a lot of like good, good tactical decision making and like, and robots.
And like there's, there's robots hunting you from like different timelines and like phasing in and out of like spatial dimensions and stuff.
1:43:18
And you know, it has everything you need, including like a very mercs arcade game style Harrier jet that's just like parked on the top of the screen moving back and forth shooting at you.
So what more could you ask for?
I will absolutely be reinstalling this game.
1:43:35
Yeah, there's like a there's like a free to play.
I don't know if it's like a prologue specifically, but it's it's called Synthetic Arena.
That's a free to play version that if you're like, well, maybe I'll give it a shot.
Like it's kind of it's basically all the same gameplay, but a very tuned down version and synthetic to the sequel to this game that is like is all 3D assets instead of like the 2D Sprite work.
1:43:56
I think it's just starting to get its robotic legs under itself had kind of a rocky early access period, but it's just starting to kind of turn that curve.
I think that's another game along with with Quasimorph that once it hits one point, O like, yeah, there will be some good stuff there, but synthetic one quite quite a good experience if you can find that, like turn down the white flashing button.
1:44:21
And up next on our techno part of the evening is probably gosh, I don't know, like really the hero journey of of music and and indie game dev.
Up next is Ace from the game Crab Champions.
1:45:22
None.
1:46:05
You're listening to Ace the song from April, maybe a question mark April Fool's joke game Crab Champions that yeah, is is composed by one Noise Storm, who is an EDM producer and whose music is fairly well known from mid twenty 10s.
1:46:29
You might remember him from the YouTube, the music video Crab Rave, which also released on April 1st, April 1st, 2018.
That has like, I don't know, like 300 million views on YouTube or something crazy and.
Yeah, so I brilliant marketing.
1:46:47
Yeah.
Playing the long con.
I want to put out an indie game.
What do I do?
First viral video of crabs dancing on having a rave on the beach.
Yeah, well, yeah, I'm on con indeed, because Noise Storm, being an Irish DJ and music producer for years and years beforehand, noodling around with Unreal Engine and like, Oh yeah, I'll put together this crab rave video.
1:47:11
And then like that, that wound up like peeking at #14 on Billboard's Dance slash electronic song chart.
And then like, I guess the, the royalties from that just like catapulted him to to be like, all right, well, now I have enough like funds banked up.
1:47:28
I can actually.
Make a crab based video game.
Yeah, like as as we all do, we all have.
That living, yeah.
Living the drain.
I'm using my viral universe Proceeds to fund my crab based video game obsession.
And you would think that so April 1st, 2023 Crab Champions releases in in early access.
1:47:47
And you would think that a game released on April 1st with like crab based like nuclear Throne or enter the Gungeon style, like, like gameplay would just be like, yeah, that's a funny joke.
It's it's I think at least in terms of like there's many ways to rank video games and how good they are by various metrics.
1:48:06
Steam DB has a pretty, a pretty good one that I like.
And if you start by like all of the different like rogue genres on Steam, DB Crab Champions is like in the top 10 of all rogue games on Steam in terms of like of incredible rating.
1:48:22
Yeah.
When are we going to play it?
Well, you know, maybe if we maybe next April, Yeah, maybe next April 1st.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll announce ahead of time, Hey, Will's actually going to be on this episode, April Fools.
1:48:37
Or even better, we'll, we'll tell Will.
Oh yeah, we're ready.
We're ready to play Slay the Spire 2 and then rug pull.
It's it's crab Champions and it's only him on the podcast and he has to.
Go got him now.
I kid, I kid.
Our wonderful Co host.
He should be back soon.
1:48:55
All right, up next is a very weird and popular song slash game, a very highly listener requested game for us to play.
Up next is the theme song from Library of Runia String Theocracy.
1:49:16
Open the curtains, lights on.
Don't miss a moment of this experiment.
Oh, the book is strange.
Like clock or gorge.
Keep your eyes butter till the end.
Which you are you going to?
1:49:46
Just for me, one pin 2 pin, 3 pin.
Turn on girls and boycott doggy two life in behind me.
Cut it off, cut down your nose, it's going to get you killed in convenient.
1:50:05
There's comforting the trees.
If you're going to control me, please make it interesting.
How does if you feel free, why don't you try it yourself?
1:50:23
There they don't join me, so I leap down, down, down I go with Thomas Obama, tough girl.
Down, down, down I go.
I could never, ever, ever touch the soil.
My heart goes right, my head goes left and into sure I'll be your merry on that here to come.
1:50:47
My sword spread me up and fertility pinks the white hearted little beauty.
Maybe we're all cool, mushy, stuffed in the human skin.
1:51:25
Think I am done with everything now I'm ready to leave.
Looking at one night, two nights, three nights.
Connect their hands when they no longer can live.
A knowledge room, babies from hopeful curiosity.
1:51:43
You're still happy.
This is for my discovery.
What's the colour of the electric shape you see?
And if you love me, can you look there?
Everything too for me.
That is Library of Runya's theme song String Theocracy by the very, I guess the famous Japanese indie music group Millie.
1:52:13
That is another kind of like it's kind of baffling to me that like these weird indie games that we cover here on the podcast can like somehow like harangue these like super top tier like pop groups to like compose their music for them.
1:52:32
This one.
Yeah.
What is it like 19 million views on YouTube for just the the theme song to this to this game library of Rooney.
Definitely a weird one.
That is, I think in it's it's tied I think for second or first for our most listener requested game that I don't think will would touch with a 10 foot pole.
1:52:54
I tried.
To look like so far while we've been doing this, I've been looking at gameplay for each game that we've been covering and I don't understand what I'm looking at when I'm trying to look at gameplay.
I mean, I'm sure it's good.
It's just like there's a lot of stuff going on and it's like a motion level.
1:53:11
There's like 6 people on screen and they're like shooting beams and a weird pattern and then you're like a light novel section.
What's happening?
It is.
Well it's the game itself is a direct sequel to another game that I think is like vaguely Rogi called Lobotomy Corporation, which is like an eldritch horror colony SIM, like SCP style monster management simulator.
1:53:39
And like just the fact that I could say those words and then have a game be like a follow up sequel to it is baffling.
But this is like, it's a deck builder game that has, I believe, like there's a strong story element to it in a way that like world of horror was designed previous episode world of Horror.
1:53:59
So like you have like story elements that are kind of like randomly dispersed throughout based on your, your actions or whatever.
And there's like a very like unique card deck building system as well as like learning and studying like all these like deck building systems for his game.
1:54:16
Like this one has like like a very like play, almost like a stage set up.
And there's like there's acts and scenes that are like kind of your initiative rolling system and like like you play your cards and the individual cards have action points.
1:54:32
There's like attack defense special types as well, but there's like a like a stagger system, almost like a like a secoro or like a dark or like a Elden ring style, like stamina meter that like if you break break their poise, then they're they can take like double damage type stuff.
1:54:47
So there's all sorts of like weird systems and things going on that are like very interesting.
Anime is not like my #1 aesthetic for games, but like this one seems like well done enough that like yeah I could.
I could definitely see why a lot of listeners are writing in for us to cover the said game.
1:55:08
Looking at the I just stopped at a random point in a YouTube video and it's like 2 little anime figures like very cutesy.
One of them has the words gut harvesting over the top and the other one has the word time for a little test like what is happening in this game.
1:55:25
What a deal.
Well, you know, what I've always loved about anime is that, you know, you can get really interesting, really wild off the wall concepts that you would not see in regular film.
And the same goes for, you know, you get wild concepts you wouldn't see in regular games, apparently.
1:55:44
Very interesting.
First I'm hearing of of this game.
Yeah, we should definitely cover this at some point.
Well, in in the.
Listeners are right, Let it be known the.
Listeners demand it.
And they could not be more correct.
I sorry to cut you off.
1:56:01
Well, no, yeah.
I mean we somehow made it over over 2 hours into this episode without a a mention of of our next game and this next, this next track is Battle with the Champ from Drum Roll Please.
1:56:18
There's your free space on the bingo card for Grokpod Slay the Spire.
1:57:16
The.
1:57:29
Listening to battle with the champ from Sleigh the Spire and depending on what what boss you roll for.
For act 2, it could be the champ, it could be the Bronze Automaton, or it could be the collector.
But this was brought to us by composer Clark Abboud, and I always forget how good the soundtrack to this game is.
1:57:51
Yeah, I will say that I did feel like it was missing something.
The various sounds of the hyper beams and the like.
My brain says like this, this soundtrack is missing something it used to.
They need to add in the sounds of cards being played.
Oh, I thought you were going to say the jaw harp.
1:58:07
Yeah, and the jaw harp.
And the jaw harp it can.
Only make a song better.
Yeah, you know, super cinematic.
It's got that, you know, movie score vibe like it's it's it's epic and not in just the the Mimi usage of of the of the word.
1:58:26
Definitely epic, definitely feels like a proper cinematic boss battle.
Yeah, I think it's one of the first.
We haven't listened to too many so far tonight that had like true orchestral score.
We had a lot of synthy dark synth medley stuff, which is very cool for a lot of games.
1:58:45
But it is always like, you know, it's this is feels like it's taking cues from Hollywood more than like Doom.
Yeah, And I remember, I don't know, this is still going on, but more so in my like teenage years, there was a lot of discussion as a gamer and like about games regarding like, oh, our our games should be, should games be taken seriously?
1:59:14
Are they actual art?
Can they be as entertaining as like a great film?
And it's nice to hear this, right.
And it's and it's nice to hear like a game, especially an indie game that, you know, hey, this this sounds like a film.
This is this is great.
This is outstanding.
Yeah, I think like any time that I hear music from Slay the Spire, I'm immediately transported to moments where I'm like, I I remember playing that card at that time and just barely eeking out a win and it feeling so good.
1:59:42
And yeah, like I think that there's a reason why it's the it's the number one game on on our podcast rankings.
It does raise my stress level just like one pick though.
It's like Oh no Oh no, how do I have the cards?
Do I have it?
Where's Where's my ferry in the bottle probabilities?
2:00:00
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I'm, I'm very excited.
Like what what's, what's our what's our betting pool for whether or not if Slave the Spider 2 is actually going to get released in early, even in early access this year?
I have no idea.
Because at this point, the year's like more than half over.
I right I have not been following it at all.
2:00:18
The only updates I get are from Will and Will seems convinced that it's going to release any day now.
Like literally like he will reference like all right, well we're going to you know, I'm going to pick this game assuming Slave the Spire 2 doesn't come out.
Like what are you talking about?
What is the official word from the developers?
2:00:37
It'll be done when it's.
Any day now.
Well, why?
Why is the fan base thinking that it could be?
They just, they believe so hard that they're they're, they're they, they have to.
It feels like, it feels like there's a lot of copium being consumed.
2:00:54
I mean this fan base, I'm sorry, I don't know how.
I don't know how long it took for Slave Aspire 1 to get from like early development stages into early access, but I imagine like if something and it's so hard for like a game that has like such like magnitude to it and like like literally like genre defying like qualities.
2:01:16
Like how do you follow that up?
Like I mean, Hades Hades has Hades 2, which is very good.
We'll see once it crosses the one point O threshold, like how big of shoes it could possibly fill.
I almost feel like slave the Spire 2 has bigger shoes to fill because like it's it's on so many platforms.
2:01:34
It has such like this broad appeal.
There hasn't been a Hades board game released yet.
But yeah, I imagine like the developers are very cautious to make.
OK, like we have one impression to make with early access and it better land and it better be damn good, otherwise they're going to be crawling out of a hole like with Quasimorph.
2:01:54
Or they're going to be crawling up our Spire to slay us.
Yes.
But yeah, I think only only good, good hopes.
I think even if Slave Aspire 2 releases in early access and it's like basically the same game as Slave Aspire one, like that would still be great.
2:02:12
And it's just maybe more of a good thing.
I'm I'm hoping I have hopes for some kind of weird Metal Gear Solid 2 rug pull plot twist.
First person.
The third.
Third over the shoulder.
Third person action RPG.
2:02:27
Yeah, of course.
I mean, who wouldn't?
Who wouldn't?
Baldur's Gate 3 style.
You've got each, all four of them are your party members, and you're climbing up the tower.
Yeah, I thought it was weird how Sleigh the Spire 2 went into this strange anime turn with it being like a stage play and like all these elder tours and stuff.
2:02:45
But, you know, it worked.
What the That's what the listeners demanded.
Well.
We shall see.
Yeah, that's of course age-old problem.
How do you follow up what is widely considered to be a masterpiece, widely considered by by most people?
And of course, Enter the Gungeon 2 is going to have the same problem.
2:03:05
But anyway.
And yeah, well, obviously we know that Slave the Spire 2 is going to deliver in one department, and that is the music, because of course the composer is coming back.
Is he?
That's my understanding.
Oh.
OK, good.
Research I just did excellent.
2:03:20
Yeah, I'm yeah, the the soundtrack for slaves fire one being so strong, like and there's a lot of like very subtle motifs in there too that like you can bring back in very like subtle and creative ways for for number 2.
So yeah, I think that that'll be a good one.
All right, well I've kept my Co host here long enough. 2 1/2 hours by my phone stopwatch of us jamming out to video game music for for the summer here.
2:03:45
Yeah.
Yeah, toe, toe jamming.
We're Erlin, we're battling and yeah, I think that'll that'll give us some some buffer time to actually get back into the nice swing of things.
We have a nice we have a brutal, brutal second-half of the schedule lined up with so many deaths, so many runs, lots of massive titles coming down the pipe here for the second-half of the program for this year.
2:04:15
And assuming that slate Aspire 2 doesn't just like shadow drop during one of those weeks of like huge games that we have planned to cover.
But in the meantime, you can e-mail us in with your stories of going to blockbustervideoandrentingtoejamandearlgrogpodzone@gmail.com.

Ron Mastodon Grogpod at game dev dot place.
And I didn't set up a blue sky account, but there's like one of those weird like blue sky mirrors that like mirrors from like another, another system that like if you're on blue sky, you could see like all of my dumb Mastodon posts by just the hunting for Grogpod on there.
2:04:52
I didn't set it up, but it's there.
I mean, yeah, another thing to manage anyway, Grogpod dot zone the website with all the rankings and stuff.
So, Oh yeah, we have to go through our our extensive rankings of all the music that we just listened to and rank each one.
No, that's where you find like all the other shows and stuff that we've done.
2:05:11
But yeah, it's it's time to time to wind out our summer music fest here.
And so playing us out here actually will be an extra track here from a a mystery game that will has picked.
I'm not going to include it in the in the show notes here as as a little fun game for people to try to suss out what what game is this from that that Will has picked out for us?
2:05:36
So stay tuned for our next episode where we will be playing us out with this one.
But yeah, make sure to get some rest.
It's been it's been a hot summer.
Get some rest intent and we'll see you out there in those new lands.
