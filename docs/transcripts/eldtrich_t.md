grogpod roguelike podcast what the heck was that like I I I I know this stuff but like what it is it is the language of the histonic I think is that how you say it uh chathonic cathonic uh Sonic sounds about right gone uh that inhabit the world of the game that we are talking about this week on the grogpod roguelike podcast where each episode of this podcast as you can probably guess uh we talked about a roguelike game uh and in this instance uh well I am your host first off the definitely cursed by Cthulhu itself uh for the past few days Scott Berger and with me are my co-hosts while the internet uh still holds up uh brainwashed into participating by ghoulish tentacles it's Colin the flying eyeball oh and this is a will uh that you punch a bull penguin well uh Cthulhu for talking to you as well uh this is Andrew adequately excellent Harshman a little HP Lovecraft pop quiz for you fellas uh adequately excellent what do you think that is referring to in HP lovecraftisms uh any guesses any guesses well I'll tell you it's what is uh at one point wife Sonia green at one point described uh his lovemaking ability called him an adequately excellent lover which is uh I mean I feel like those are two words that mean different things well I you know I like to give it sort of a favorable look like excellent but like fully excellent anyway anyway this is my pick eh yes this week this week we are talking uh the Laura Croft Minecraft adventure game Eldritch uh released on Steam way we're dialing the the uh the timeline way way back to 2013 uh October 21st 2013 in fact uh where Eldritch first appeared on the steam scene as what's my factoid section here say the 45th overall rogue rogue type game released on Steam uh which I guess we'll get into it but it sounds believable uh should you should you be uh uh driven by Madness to find where Eldridge is you can find it on Steam itch.io you can find it on the The Humble game store and from the developers website directly uh this game was developed by minor key games which is composed of two twin brothers David Pittman and Jay Kyle Pittman although I think uh that's that's the dev Studio but I think for this game it was a entirely solo Dev effort by David Pittman himself the guy that I linked the uh the Youtube uh GMC talk from uh that's the guy but they both I believe previously worked on games like Borderlands Borderlands 2 BioShock 2 uh the bureau XCOM Declassified and their Dev studio is best known for like this this name sounds familiar I haven't played this game but it is free to pick up at your local uh game supplier uh a 2012 free to play metroidvania game called you have to win the game does that sound does that sound uh sounds intriguing yeah I just lost the game

uh Eldritch rolls in on our stat sheet uh with the 289th most popular roguelike game in our data set with 218 total reviews uh Colin you've picked up an adventurer's Journal describing this game in one sentence what does it tell you uh use a knife to carve your way through a three-dimensional maze of Nintendo 64 graphics wow that was incredible you got it you nailed it

that's Eldritch also Fishman oh and a fish man I think you mean look

makes it sound like chimpanzees for some reason I thought that was that's that's the that's the Eldritch horror-ness of it uh I think but before before we really kind of like jump into uh this game I think we have to rely on Andrew's expertise on who this uh Hewlett Packard Lovecraft guy was uh oh yes um well uh HP Lovecraft is uh responsible for uh a lot of unfortunate things but one of the nice things that he had a hand did uh was establishing the Cthulhu Mythos um which was a is and is a a shared Universe of uh strange fiction stories he was an author in the early 20th century and uh he's had sort of uh well well after his his death um you know a rise to to prominence and fame uh Cthulhu is all over the place Cthulhu Mythos this Cthulhu Mythos of that um and uh you know I just got to say that it's it's really great to be able to engage with a problematic author who you don't have to like worry at all about like accidentally giving them money because he did so I can enjoy all of his uh Tom Fuller without uh too much concern uh for my uh the state of my mortal soul I I gotta Google this now I'm not gonna bother the podcast oh what's the controversy behind the scenes an old white racist guy and there's an important and I I don't want to get too much into it but like there is a a read on a lot of his fiction uh where oh they're there are some troubling metaphors fortunately

um none of which are in this game none of them have pressed into this game indeed indeed you know how sometimes they say people were like oh they're bad but it was of their time he was bad for his time uh so I've heard so I've heard um I I did indeed have a pretty significant uh sort of uh Cthulhu Mythos phase of of my life and I still sort of identify to some extent as a person who uh likes that type of fiction um and that's what brought me to this game was like oh there's not a whole lot of good Cthulhu based games I'd like to play this I like to play it Eldritch Horror uh type of a game um that contains uh some of these lovable monsters and and and themes nothing well not the theme so much but some of these tropes and things that I I've enjoyed you know reading about um and uh yeah you know it's Elder Rich hey that's a great title am I right am I right fellas yeah I mean it is a little a little difficult for SEO purposes I imagine this was probably easier 10 years ago sure but searching for I guess like if you were searching steam Eldridge or like Eldritch game yeah

Eldritch FPS or something like you'd probably get directed to this pretty easily um I've been kind of surprised that like the critical reception to this game not to like Jump Ahead to our our rankings too directly here but like the general consensus that I've seen from like reviews on steam or uh comments on YouTube on people's Let's Plays and stuff are generally like super fond of this like at the time yeah uh this game seemed to have filled a a niche that was sort of missing it feels like at the time and and I see a lot of YouTube comments people are like still playing this in 2022 and really yeah okay interesting or like yeah comment chains of stuff like that like like there's there's like an interesting and yeah this this game seems to have had a big enough of an impact at the time to really warrant a kind of uh impact that maybe it hasn't aged so well now right but it definitely seems like it had you know some some kind of Major Impact at the time and I guess you know being one of the first 50 rogie games released on Steam I don't remember if it had to go through green light back then um but yeah I could definitely see the question which before we get too far along uh forget HP Lovecraft what a goofy name come on give me a break uh Lovecraft would have better off naming himself uh Minecraft I don't know uh so let us uh maybe we should paint a picture for the listeners like what this game what actually is are we talking about here so it's a vaguely Minecraft looking and that it's like you know a grid-based game uh the graphics are not dissimilar although I mean they have sort of a unique aesthetic to them but like low poly pretty basic and it's all like sort of procedurally generated and you're going into these procedurally generated uh dungeons which are all Cthulhu Mythos themes so uh and you are the challenge is to Traverse the dungeon basically which is very roguelike I suppose yeah it's interesting that this game kind of you you hit the go button and you wake up in a library and classic there's yeah classic roguelikes I love craft location also classic uh Minecraft Trope uh and you know you have a book open in front of you saying that oh man this is this Library seems to go on forever I can't make my way out of here but there's something in those books in front of me and your Your Story begins with you exploring one of these these books or pumpkins or something that you happen to click on inside this Library uh and then you wake up in basically uh like we're gonna we're gonna reference Minecraft here a lot but I'm trying to think of ways to describe this without using the word Minecraft uh like you were saying Andrew voxel-based cubes of being inside an underground dungeon Asher Escher based uh escher-esque like weird geometry of building like not built for human type stuff uh 3D block puzzle it's not really a puzzle though it is it's just a labyrinth essentially and the goal is to amazing maybe you got three levels per floor and uh the procedural generation I think was like that was the hobby horse of the uh the Creator or the developer for this one where it was just essentially how do I create a world where I can like have paths that people can travel that don't that actually make somewhat some amount of sense and yeah sure I'll throw some monsters in there and some like little items to help you know give you a little bit of challenge but essentially it was just a labyrinth and you just try find the exit three times get an orb and do that three times is that the game uh it's uh it's uh fairly close I've I feel like I think this is a great place to start like this is one of the most positive aspects of the game up front I feel like of any game that I have yeah in terms of like procedural generation it's it's kind of a gamble sometimes it feels like and I was impressed even you know 20 20 excuse me 10 years on after its release um I I personally was pretty impressed with like how well that aspect was done like in general it felt like it worked it flowed pretty well and the times when it was like weird and escher-esque that sort of worked to the theme worked with the theme of the game which is oh you're in this uh sanity blasting unnatural paranormal place um but yeah it's worth noting that like this kind of design is not super common for this sort of genre uh because like I feel like outside of Minecraft you don't see this kind of procedural dungeon diving uh aspect a lot despite how Minecraft is am I wrong like I mean like what's that dwarf game uh Deep Rock galactic right that's that's uh low poly it's not as low but like it's procedural generation and there are very few games where I feel like I get lost in a three-dimensional space I feel like it's basically Minecraft and this like everything else like you can feel as if it has a an intended path versus I found myself like I don't know where I am yeah if you can throw some torches down on the wall that would have made a lot of a that means you would have not done nearly as much backtracking in this game because yeah you're right it is very easy to get lost did Minecraft come out before this I'm I think it did right oh yeah yeah I mean probably debatably somewhere between like yeah that would like 2009-ish to 2011-ish because we were playing this in in undergrad yeah and by this I mean Minecraft right and so did I didn't watch that full YouTube you sent it out but it was basically the dead talking about the hit that there his interest in building this game but did he mention like a direct reference to Minecraft at all no I think he came at it he came at it from the other end okay because it felt like this is this is essentially it felt in many ways like oh yeah and my the puzzle here is how do I create like the the Minecraft um like chasms or like mine system just like oh yeah that's the same sort of engine it feels like it could have been powering both of those things I don't know maybe that's that's just I mean yeah it it feels that way but I think what he was saying in his talk was that he already had this kind of game engine that existed and he wanted to see if he could do that kind of three-dimensional um Labyrinth generation in it as opposed to Minecraft which is like here's this like big insane sandbox and like that just happens to fall out of it but also like Minecraft doesn't really have much of like a well it does now but I guess at the time didn't have a really sort of directionally goal oriented design where it's like start like start is here finishes here build all the stuff in between and do it in like a 3D Insanity level and put some lizard man in there and put some lizard men and some weird statues that sneak up on you if you look good maybe you're back on them you want to talk about the enemies absolutely yeah let's rock and roll right here flying flying eyeball uh you called yourself a flying eyeball Colin I was actually looking at the wiki earlier because I was as I was playing this game I was I was trying to tap into my my Cthulhu Mythos knowledge which I'm a little rusty on and uh I was for acting in my brain trying to figure out what what is the what is the flying eye I recognize the floating polyp I recognize the night gaunt I recognize the shaggers but what is this flying eyeball and as it turns out it's just called The Flying eyeball

like obscure like footnote to like really you know I mean there's a flying eyeball rare manuscript in like a bunch of stuff I'm assuming he's from like Doom sure sure I just I mean so many of the monsters like direct references to uh yeah uh uh yeah yeah yeah the the monsters what about those monsters are chimpanzee sounding worms a common thing in the HP Lovecraft Mythos oh I wanted to get y'all's take on this I mean the worms now is that a reference uh to a layer of the White Worm the strange fiction story I mean that's probably it right I think they're face Busters all right excellent or chest Busters or whatever just bursters perhaps facehuggers face huggers am I conflicting them no I don't I I don't know I'm not sure what the word that was another one of those just sort of generic anime that I don't think is the specific reference to a specific story I didn't pick up on the the sound the sound effect but uh anyway um yeah the uh the what do y'all think of the well the enemy design I feel like they're uninspired perhaps inspired oh interesting well okay so I guess like the the the uh the dev defense here this is definitely going to be an all devs go to Heaven episode I feel like but you keep saying that but it's never gonna make it more true the we all die and go to the Earth exactly and then underneath that Earth is a Labyrinthian uh 3D Puzzle maze with chimpanzees sounding uh worms but the the devil was saying like when he was designing this game he was like intentionally going like super low budget this was just kind of like a vehicle

uh yes uh so as previously referenced it was kind of uh uh you know design practices we want to have a silence here for editing purposes because you cut out

we should just push through as you said the Cthulhu curse is upon you the you need to get yourself an elder sign as quickly as possible to oh hold off this horrible incursion of Eldritch voices uh unfortunately Scott's internet is a little bit wonky today um but uh sorry do continue Scott uh you were talking about how uh the dev was speaking at GDC and he said this is a vehicle for the game as a vehicle for uh yeah uh thank you for for catching that uh yeah that's uh that's any time that I'm gonna be uh badmouthing Cthulhu then the internet's just gonna happen to drop out here but we'll hope the recording salvages it but yeah like um I think the dev was saying that like he intentionally went low budget and was trying to like use this game as like a platform for learning how to do that kind of 3D uh design element and he was saying like he was actually kind of surprised that he had like a 10x Roi from his his like development so I think that like yes the like the monsters and items are very uh light in their design charitably uh but if the goal was like oh yeah I think I'm just gonna try to like build this thing um then I think that you know it kind of succeeded in that regard but like there are there's some ideas here that are interesting um but I don't know that the game has really continued active development in a way that's like really yeah um yeah like really like polish it up I guess it felt to me like a pretty good Tech demo sure yeah I think that's exactly it interesting sure that's that's a a decent comparison uh I feel like there's enough enemy variety and they all kind of uh they have enough different gimmicks that differentiate them that it's like it's not I I think it's arguably one of the better aspects of the game uh the variety of monsters um but overall uh there could stand to be more um that's that's for sure yeah Colin was right and how do you kill all of them well what do you what do you do you run up to them with the knife you punch and stab them twice essentially or three times or two or three yeah and exactly and you could use a gun but the gun like is you know you get limited ammo and so the knife is just like it's almost it's just ridiculously easy with all pretty much all the enemies just go stab stab um now later they do start shooting things at you and it gets a little bit more like oh I've gotta like not stand right in front of them but um yeah it's so it felt kind of uh for this game I mean there are I I don't I don't give allowances for the scope of the game like Scott's talking about oh if the goal was this Tech I don't care about the devs go which I care about my goal which is to have fun sure I'll tell you what I failed I failed big time and I think I think Will's uh criticism is justified by the price point of the game being this is a good point fifteen dollars I don't factor that in either though yeah I mean uh again like all right Richie over here no no no I I look at I put all games on an even playing field like purchased or not like Baldur's Gate three should get in my opinion that's a [ __ ] game another Eldritch inspired game mind you so if I know the emails the emails are flowing in too yeah if I have him to blame for for Baldur's Gate three then that's all makes sense this is your fault too right um that's funny that's funny that was a 60 game so sure sure well I was going to say but uh yeah 15 feels a little bit expensive I was actually kind of shocked that it is not on like permanent discount being so old right uh maybe it goes on on sale often but uh I don't know yeah so like monsters in this game you have yeah we kind of talked about flying eyeballs there's fish men that run around there's people scorpion Critters uh this game is super hard because these little like these Critters that run around you your character which from the from the title art of this game gets me like super Jazz mic okay I'm some sort of early 1900s uh like woman India materialist with a pistol yeah I'm like I'm if you're like an adventure right you're a woman yeah I mean on the on the main menu screen you can customize your characters

great outstanding yeah the like the character customization to what end like you never see your character it's your hands I guess yeah I don't know but um so you know you have like various kind of Lovecraft inspired Monsters uh you know and and there's like lizards and lizard statues that if you turn away from them they'll attack you which I think is a neat idea your items are are pretty kind of like what you would expect from a game like this you have a knife you can throw bottles and rocks and you have a um underrated entertaining aspect of this game just using a revolver to shoot Mages a plus idea absolutely I I agree there's something very cathartic about shooting the cultist that's very like Cthulhu role-playing game story like run around chomping on a cigar and like just blasting cultist right um but also like it's very cathartic to just like kill these like unbeatable unknownable Elder tours with just a regular gun very entertaining uh but of course you've read edible it's pretty quickly um yeah the uh the the items as far as like the the uh the inventory items I was I was a little underwhelmed by those and as well as you know the weapons and um also the magic I felt like was a little underwhelming and the fact that you couldn't combine any of them or have like I felt like they were too simple and if they were going to be that simple there needed to be an option to pair them together and they only have they cost money to use right like your Mana was your money which means that I'm never going to use any of the items ever because that's how I play video games can you spend the money on I don't know the shot nothing because I'm hoarding it for when I might use it there's there's like shopkeeper oh yeah there was a Shopkins that you use the the blue coins uh to pay for stuff but I mean yeah I don't know like I never I never felt uh really compelled to go into the shops be like okay I'm like I finally found a shop now I can use it to to buy this thing to progress further like in there's a lot of um uh uh overlaps with Titan of the roguelike uh genre Spelunky in here but just like it's like what if Spelunky was in 3D but a tech demo version it's kind of like what this is you know you have a level you get on the bottom you might like collect some stuff along the way and again solo Dev effort but uh we're like I kind of want to test out a new segment at the end of the show but we'll maybe mention it now but there's another game that's very similar in design aesthetic to this that it's like it does literally everything possibly better which is called Barony and and that's a game that like one of the uh listeners requested for our listener request episode way back when uh and I was like oh you know this this looks kind of interesting uh and then the more that I was playing of Eldritch I was like man I feel like Barony would be way better at this aspect that aspect and it has four player local co-op and like ooh uh maybe maybe this is gonna jump up on the uh on the two playlist relatively soon but um but yeah I thought that like that kind of that kind of aspect seemed seemed like it was hitting kind of all the same notes oh they're shopkeepers there's reasons why you get to the end of the level but yeah I don't know like it just it didn't feel like it really for me like it felt like it was surprising that people had such fond memories of this game because like playing it now like in a fresh in a fresh uh context and given that you know we've had all these incredible games come out since then uh be like Eldridge like it's not really the fault of the game per se but it has not aged well in in retrospect yeah pretty much everything that it does except for the three-dimensional maze has been done many times right uh I did think that like the the second time I like played it for a bit I I did I did get a hint of like where people could enjoy it you get like just a little bit of a flow State running around just jumping and like a port almost like a parkour experience of just you're flowing through the maze trying to figure out the may like you're you're a rat running a maze and like get to and feel good um definitely definitely and uh to your point the the act of doing that the movement very tight very smooth like you've got a little a little tiny pull-up Vault move which I always appreciate yeah so like I can see that's the only thing that I think it still feels I don't know it's like fresh but it still feels like it hasn't been overdone in 2023 like they're still not like really complex 3D mazes it's just not done probably because it's not very good for the most part but it does mean that it's somewhat novel mm-hmm

well ironically HP Lovecraft never wrote a novel but uh only a novella uh it should be noted uh yeah pretty pretty pretty novel and I was impressed that that held up I played this game when it was relatively new and I remembered I didn't like love it as much as as these reviews that you're referencing Scott but I did like enjoy it and the main reason that I stopped playing was that like it felt like I needed to invest more time in it yeah and I just at the time I I didn't feel like doing that basically the weird in a weird kind of like parallel world like I've been playing a lot of uh uh uh like OG quake and there's like also a love crafting game oh well yeah there you go uh oh no legitimately uh yeah I like I spent enough time on that final boss to know uh but yeah the uh like the movement like flow in Quake feels kind of similar here or like there's like times where you can get like like bunny hopping momentum going like oh this is this feels like pretty good uh but then you know you hit the wall of like the 3D underground chunk you're like uh I wish I could have you know had had more uh speed or Freedom going I watched a uh a YouTube Speed Run of this game that someone like literally be the entire game uh start book one to end of book four uh finish in like two minutes and 30 seconds ow all right it was it was Quake style bunny hopping Mayhem it was great awesome that's that's very impressive I can dig it uh but uh yeah interesting interesting tie-in uh Quake one of the designers on Quake was Sandy Peterson who was uh like lead designer on the uh they call it Cthulhu role-playing game and so like a lot of the lore and background in Quake is based in Cthulhu mytho stuff like the final boss is like uh like shuknagaroth or something um and anyway launchers and nail guns yeah that's uh yeah they spent a lot of time talking about that and uh the 1920s uh pulp action stuff uh anyway um interdimensional slip gate so yeah it's interesting that they both have like a similar sort of moveset yeah sure but um the combat what do we think of the combat as you you were talking about it uh uh talking about it there will uh not the best that's combat not not at all yeah no uh what the here's something I didn't understand so I think there's like two or three different types of guns right that like there's a revolver and there's like this flintlock pistol they both they both take the exact same round and they shoot the exact same they're the same gun but they're just having this principle at all

yeah they just they just all they seem the same like I mean so so okay you have those two weapons you can carry up to two weapons on you and so one was always a knife because the knife is just like you just just does as much damage anything else and most things you can just stab and so uh it's more powerful says the wiki oh well there you go I didn't realize that everything seemed to die in one shot regardless or two shots though I shouldn't be using it the whole time oh yeah you guys do you guys stealth much I think as soon as I found that I was dying a lot especially like as you get further in I'm like oh okay well I guess I don't want to fight everything but most of the time I die for some what felt like some [ __ ] thing that saw me in the distance that I wouldn't have been able to stop anyways it fired some blast Eldridge blast at me and uh I mean those flying eyeballs are probably the like the worst enemy in this game by a country mile because like you do rely on that knife so much and the flying eyeballs are just like no I'm just gonna like shoot a fireball for me from across like the map basically right you can't you can't mitigate it you can't sneak up on them really because they're just like right wigging out somewhere and and you only have three hit points to start with like you can get more but it feels it feels very scary from that aspect of like oh my God like like everything does a crazy amount of damage to you uh spikes on the floor like you can't those are hard to jump over if they're too too deep or um icicles coming from the ceiling or little tiny scorpions that are hard to see or uh you know a flying eyeball from across the map like the the for me it felt like I'm just gonna run through this as fast as possible and not like worry about any of the enemies and I think that worked like 60 of the time

yeah fight when you have to otherwise just run through I thought the stealth was interesting but I I just I felt like I didn't have the patience for it it's like I I wanna I need to get as many runs under my belt and just try to power through this so I'm gonna go like Bunny Hop Quake mode yeah so you were you weren't doing the Crouch and then I noticed that you could actually lean around things I totally forgot because I was like a week

I didn't use that mechanic very much maybe that would have helped if you wanted it like doesn't yeah it's balanced for lean which I usually love uh I'm shock that I uh yeah I didn't use it um yeah I had a simple experience um I I really I want to talk about the kind of something important in game design in general and where I feel like you know what's the one thing if you could change one thing about this game um I don't know if you all agree with this but I don't think the procedural generation did anything to make this game better and I think that a curated set of like three you know four Maps or whatever like where okay I'm just imagining like it something is very common I think most maybe the audience would have played like the GoldenEye game N64 very much uh bespoke you know everything's built all the enemies are placed in very specific locations and you are doing that run over and over again if you die and you're learning more about it but like and it's and it's fundamentally different and like you know it's not surprising like the layout of the landscape what's what's surprising is like how far you can get are you getting Mastery over how to get through areas and I felt like that would have been a much more interesting take on like this game in general rather than just like procedural generation be just because I can like that just didn't it didn't do anything for me and I think in general if we look across lots of different games that are coming out the procedural generation like when does it work and when is it not I think that's an important question and I think that most of the time when you think it's gonna do something good for your game it probably won't I think procedural generation is way harder than people think it is like you have to I I've listened to some talks from people like doing the procedural generation for Minecraft and they put like many person years of effort into it to get it to as good as it is it's like wow it's amazing it's like yeah they tried really hard uh you can't just like slap some some stuff together and import proc gen done yeah um I do disagree with you on this point though um I think that if this game had the same levels three times in a row it would be extraordinarily boring I mean like we're talking about distinct levels but like where it's bespoke and like there are certain enemies at certain locations and like your goal is to figure out how do you are like the puzzle then of the game is not the Labyrinth the puzzle is okay here's a you know there's there's one there's a thing that's going to shoot down this hallway here and there's like a melee on the left how do I like bait this guy out and then go over like figuring out like how to progress through that I think is more interesting but that's just like a different game it's a different puzzle that's what I'm saying but I think that like giving the same components that would be I think much more fun I was sort of thinking about this same question and I don't yeah I don't I don't quite know because I feel like the navigation is I mean it was obviously one of the design goals but let's say like what if that wasn't one of the design deals what the design goal was let's just make the most fun game possible would it be more fun if there were was really great level design possibly if it was a real if it was a very talented level designer probably it would um but then as you say it would be totally different but just they still have the elders characters I think it's very possible it could be more fun potentially I think there's there's Parts here that if you're just so sorry anyway like if you lean more into the insanity of lovecraftianism it would probably work better where I think the dev was saying like in his in his like proc gen uh tests that like he had different themes of chunks and that like oh and like this chunk here would be like uh like a Town Theme with like big columns and stuff and then the next door chunk would be like you know something totally different but he wound up like taking that out because it was like super distracting and jarring and what have you uh whereas I think that like if you had something that was way more like M.C Escher just like totally bizarre and again this would be super hard to do import procten uh if you had like one chunk and then the chunk adjacent to it was like tilted at like 90 degrees or something where it's like oh this house that would normally be pointing up is like pointed to the side or whatever uh like that kind of like weird like oh my God am I losing my mind walking through here would work better um and I think like there's another kind of overlap between this game and like a rogue question mark game uh that is similarly low budget and more on like The Accidental horror comedy into the Spectrum called baldi's basic plus uh which has similarly a low budget character creation but has done so in in a theme that's like accidentally horror uh I think like there's there's a spice here that kind of hits that same nerve but like like it's trying too hard kind of um so I think like the the proc gen could be done better if it was like the further you uh progressed down in each uh stage uh level um that like it got progressively like weirder navigate like the the statues where like you look away from them and then they move like that's a very like cool horror thing that I think is like I want more of that uh there's some secret um areas too I believe that uh Andrew did you get the good ending to this game so I found I found the item that I needed to get the good ending um and then there are some steps that I missed and so I got the the Normie ending and uh I was this is uh I wanted to talk about this but I'll talk about it right now very disappointed with the ending of this game uh not there's not much of a reward it felt very much like playing an old NES game where like you get to the end screen and it's like super underwhelming it was like thank you for grabbing text and then I'm like yeah yeah exactly cool maybe the win maybe the good ending's better or there's more to it maybe and then like I I youtubed it and it's like nope it's pretty much the same it's just uh the the readme notepad text is different it was I'm kind of a letdown um uh yeah so anyway there are some secret Areas you say it's got that sort of are a little more sanity blasting I mean yeah I think you're you're describing like one of them I think there's a secret area on the second of the third of each uh level of each stage if I'm phrasing that right okay where like you know you're finding the stuff that's required for the quote-unquote good ending uh and pardon me I found just one of them apparently oh yeah so I think you need you need all three of whatever those macguffins are and then you take those to the final uh book at the very end of the game but um but if I remember right the areas in which those things are housed are also like slightly different so it's like yeah I don't know like the proc gen that part was cool yeah oh I've stumbled into an actual like secret hidden location oh yes and it teleported me to this like shrouded weird sort of oh alternate Dimension and it it was it was definitely cool and more of that stuff I agree would have been uh really would have helped with the experience yeah I think for a game that was designed as a low budget like Tech demo uh you know it's it's fine but it definitely feels like one in dude I'm I'm personally pretty torn about it like I I felt enough of a I was compelled enough to continue playing it but I don't know if I was having that much fun most of the time there were certain moments where it was like all right cool like I'm really feeling the oh I only have you know so far in my run I only have so much health um I'm really dipping and Diving and running from all these horrible uh lovecraftian Horrors and and if that felt pretty good but like those moments were kind of few and far between I'm sorry to say

this just occurred to me um just as as the maybe uh paired with what we talked about before so the bespoke sort of like built out maps for three levels but then make it give it give it that extra flare so still the Eldritch sort of theme like I don't know I feel like there's another game that's done this and I'm probably stealing this from someone else but like uh kind of playing into that MC Escher sort of thing why not have like if gravity shift onto the walls and this becomes a puzzle game as to like you could approach this enemy straight on or you can rotate the world 90 degrees and that'll like reposition their orientation such that like maybe you want to fight them this way as opposed to like you know and then basically it's a puzzle if you go forward rotate the world 90 degrees come back I think it was uh is one of the Zelda games they did a lot of like I think the Fez that does that like that you like rotate around it I guess it's not no no that's not that well that's that's the plane you're in yeah there's there's two games that do this super well that are both puzzle games but I agree with Will would like be super cool to see this in kind of like a a rogie yeah I don't know how you would do this procedurally but uh if someone out there is like I'm looking for an impossible project uh turn either manifold Garden or anti-chamber or anti-chamber oh a mind [ __ ] uh turn either of those into some kind of like I don't know there's there's something with like doing that but rogie that would just be like we would turn my brain into dust and I'm all for it um yeah that sounds fun I'll sign me up for that game going back to the uh theme that you were kind of tapping into a bit Scott is this game Scary question mark I think it's accidentally scary because you're so squishy uh and that like the Frog man kind of Leaping around the corner of going little little like it's it's like accidentally scary like the first time you play it what's really scary is when you go into [Music] um uh like the time trial mode thing uh I forget the name of it but you go and you just Asylum the Asylum the Asylum presents uh Eldridge and you go in you have two minutes and 30 seconds to collect as many Souls as you can before the the great demon comes and eats you as a Thoth yes that's the one um and like again maybe like accidentally scary because you turn around a corner there it is and it gets you and you're like oh okay um but like once once you've seen it I don't think it's I don't think it's scary anymore but yeah I thought I thought that was pretty effective in like a sort of low budget but like smart lead done executed way but coming back to uh yeah but baldi's Basics plus like right does look like legitimately terrifying in a uh like oh my like this this was created by a person and not by some like weird Ai and or alien that was just mimicking human technology yeah I felt like at best was it startled you sometimes but I was never I never felt unsettled in any way I never felt unease as you should in a uh lovecraftian world like they just like oh it's a monster with tentacles on it's like ah it's just men 64 Graphics that's not I'm I'm I can see every every pixel every polygon so there's nothing unseen here

I don't know that one monster that travels through walls that I was that was the first one that I realized travels through walls um to chase you down um that was like oh oh not to keep moving and it was like a a slight rise in my stress for like a second then I'm like oh nice okay I guess I keep running okay famously a lot of Lovecraft were taking this they say that when they are face to face with the uh knowable Horrors they go oh but in a Boston accent um so that's interesting that's interesting well I guess to answer my own question there were a few moments that I I felt like it was kind of spoopy like there's sort of this now that we are in 2023 I I found that some of the environments were kind of off-putting and kind of unsettling in sort of a back rooms type way that did anyone get the back rooms Vibe at all uh maybe I don't know maybe like a little bit but again like it's been it's like not the fault of the game that it it has been uh possibly overshadowed by like actual like SCP Containment Breach style games uh and the one that I was thinking of just a minute ago of like oh what is baldi's basic plus remind me of Cruelty Squad that's an actual like horror like well maybe not horror but like it makes me horrified to think about that game just with like how it looks how it plays but like

and I'm a horror fan but it's like it looks it looks very unpleasant for me my specific um hell is this game so if if all this looks very intriguing yeah if Eldritch got more cruelty Squad the deeper you got into the game that would be that would be super cool like again we're just like giving out ideas for what an Eldritch 2 would be but like uh so copyright copyright tmtm but yeah uh yeah I think like this this game like it can only do so much I I get that like people have found memories of it from way back when 10 years ago but I think there's other games that do like lovecraftianism FPS hacking slash and low budget Jank nightmare better um like all individually but like none of them kind of like package it all into one thing which is what this one does

yeah rankings time is it I think is that uh yeah it's a good good transition because we got some short listener emails that I I kind of want to touch on um how do we want to do these rankings because it looks like Andrew has this game pretty high up there well I mean that's just because I've played so few of these um so yeah let me just get my get go first because I'm kind of my own sub category almost um since I haven't actually played all of these uh all the podcast games uh so I'm putting it at number five so basically pretty darn low in my list um so like second to last basically um I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bad game again I think that the the design goal of I want a game where you navigate and it's randomized every time and so that challenge is always there I think it does a pretty good job the minimap I think is pretty effective in keeping you from getting totally lost um the agency that you're granted with certain items to like break through walls um makes it so that the the navigation is never like unfair really in my in my personal opinion um but there's just all of these sort of shortcomings compound to the point where the game is is Falls quite pretty pretty short unfortunately um that being said I did want to mention very quickly uh the sound effects of the cultists uh I love that they just sound kind of minorly inconvenienced like they're just like oh oh what's going on here which ironically is a great microcosm great example of the Cthulhu Mythos sort of theme that these unknowable Eldritch Abominations from beyond the stars these Elder Gods we are so insignificant to them us humans that we are nothing but a minor inconvenience uh and so I appreciate that Eldridge does manage to get a few of these Eldritch Horror themes right uh specifically the idea of kind of going on a Cthulhu Mythos themed delve adventure and I haven't been able to find that experience in many of the games so it's I would say worth playing a bit of um but anyway sorry number five uh I digress I keep saying this we gotta get you on the one to ten system because the the rankings now that we all have different uh uh number of games that we've played because when you say five that's five out of six though right indeed so I guess maybe a more relevant metric is second to last sorry Eldritch

um cool well I um I'm already talking so here I am leaping into it it's very very simple five out of ten for me um six being at the recommend threshold it doesn't make it to the recommend it's not a total it's not a total complete waste of um of time though I mean it was interesting to to see the you know the the library set up to kind of get the lore of the game a little bit there was something novel to it but um yeah after all the reasons mentioned um I think that um with some core changes it could have been a really fun game specifically the stuff that we chatted about there um with regards to level design but um that puts it at 17 out of it looks like 31 games um which pushes a actually for me it was ahead of brotato I would rather play this game than last week's brotato game um but it was not as good as like the last spell which I gave a six out of ten so um yeah it's uh it's mine I think maybe I'll go next uh yeah I think this game is is a a solid uh eh um but where it lands on my rankings uh sounds well I don't know maybe it does deserve to kind of go down here it's kind of on the bottom tier of my list of like games that are just on the like outside edge of like a light not recommend um for me it's my 25th out of 31 uh just behind a pineapple smash crew just ahead of sort of the Stars the pit uh I think like yeah this game was probably like cool and interesting when it came out in 2013 but a lot has changed since then and yeah the the more notes that I was taking on this the more I was like you know there's gonna be a future episode when like all four of us are going to do a couch co-op session of Barony and we're just gonna be like man this is so much better than Eldritch was it doesn't have any like tentacle monsters in it but uh but yeah I think it kind of there's other games that do kind of everything else uh uh better uh the first moment that I shot a cultist with a pistol I was just like oh maybe this does have something but I'm like I guess it was just that uh yeah ending ending is bad um if if like the title card art was like closer to what the experience of the game was like that would be cool like give me more about like your Indiana Jones heroine and like she's got a revolver and she's shooting like these like winged Batman like more of that please I think the game is also like way too expensive for what it is maybe if it goes on sale for like five bucks sure uh if you're interested in that kind of thing but yeah I think there's just a bunch of other stuff that uh that just does it better so 25 for me uh yeah I have it as my number 24 5 out of ten uh right behind warsim oh you you just you wanted to stab me there eh well I mean worse I'm still better than it don't worry pull the tractor off yeah I guess because it's the number two game out of all the ones we played but yeah um I feel like I don't I don't dislike this game I just feel like it was under baked um like if it were two dollars you go like fool around in it for a while you know run around and amaze have a afternoon of fun decide if you want to play it more cool for 15 I expected like more of a game and I feel like it was just too small in scope um and it's not I don't know I just didn't find it that interesting I got I felt nothing when I shot a cultist in the face I've shot many mans and faces in video games I found nothing like I shot a cultist in um relay just to watch him die it did not feel as though it gave me no no vibe of theme none of none of it really gave any Vibe of theme to me uh I felt no sense of Eldritch Horror at any point uh except for the one time that I did the like Asylum thing and the weird smoke monster got me

right well that's Eldritch that's gonna with the way that we have I'll just close the uh Blasphemous Tome yes uh Eldritch is gonna land at number 19 out of our 31 games uh I think overall look well those those numbers will probably be adjusted as time goes on but uh but yeah for that's where it's gonna land at the moment I think so uh new segment uh possibly I'm just gonna I'm gonna Workshop this a little bit uh if you liked this kind of game what other games should you check out because we gave a glowing recommendation to it uh I've got some notes on let's see so Eldritch is kind of like a lovecraftian FPS hack and slash with low budget Jank nightmare I kind of already mentioned baldi's Basics plus if you want more of that like weird low polygon like uh almost no animation like Freakazoid kind of game check that one out uh oh I guess I should also speculate that these are all rogi type games so uh FBS FPS hack and slash we mentioned Barony a lot um another one that comes up that seems to be pretty highly rated that I think is maybe an early access or coming out this year is called mortal sin which looks super interesting it's I don't know like first person I get like Quake vibes from it like a really interesting art aesthetic um and then coming back to our favorite uh topic of the evening lovecraftianism uh there's kind of a big one of the traditional roguelike sphere infra Arcana which is supposed to be a uh lovecraftian uh turn-based tile based uh you know procgen RPG kind of a deal uh barcus dungeon one and two obvious candidates uh there's one called uh lobotomy Corporation monster management simulation which I believe is supposed to be a very SCP in style inspired uh kind of deal uh you have a a very um manga looking uh jrpg question mark game called world of horror in all caps uh very elder tree and Will was just talking about 20 minutes till dawn which I think has LG kind of aspects to it so uh if you're if you're looking for something along those same lines check any one of those out uh let's see what else we got here uh useful segment for the listeners I think hey you know even if this wasn't a cup of tea there's other games to be had so yes and hey a lot I'm hearing a lot of great recommendations uh games I'll be checking out for sure yeah and uh dovetailing to our our this time very short emails that people have been sending in so thank God uh one uh one recommendation that we got from a listener Emmanuel writes in and says please try the game against the storm smiley face uh he says uh love the podcast you guys do an awesome job so thank you for that Emmanuel um against the storm is is super interesting uh I feel like that's a game that uh what if you look it up right now you're like Rogue question mark uh there's no kind of indication that it is rogie but this is one of those weird edge cases with the data where uh every snapshot that I've been taking like once every three months or so uh this game did have like a considerable amount of like rogue-based tags to it like three or four months ago and then the developers deleted them which like is a way for them to kind of have control over that uh but again like it kind of you know stay tuned in half in a few episodes for when we do our two and a half hour long debate episode of what is a roguelike exactly um but yeah I think that game super interesting to kind of check out is uh I believe something along the same lines of like a last spell type game if you didn't have the individual unit micromanagement um yeah no it's overwhelmingly positive it's got um lots of great ratings here and it looks like it's uh 35 off right now so oh hey well timed look at that uh the other email we got rolling in is from our dear friend Davian uh at the fuchsia plays on YouTube he says uh just listen to the luck be a landlord episode around the 40 minute Mark uh made me think of an important note regarding roguelikes yes roguelikes have luck based gameplay but for a lot of them there are a lot of ways to circumvent being affected by random outcomes which got me thinking like okay what what are examples of like good Randomness and bad Randomness and uh I think in Eldritch here like the first time I booted up I ran into a pit that was like two blocks deep and I couldn't jump out of it I'm like is there some there's got to be something I'm doing wrong here and then I was thinking like no this is just bad Randomness here potentially

yeah I feel like

Randomness that you have some sort of like the randomness where you do get some sort of control out of it or you there are strategies to mitigate it um is is generally better I I feel like I've been from like playing board games I've been drawn a lot more towards like deck draw style Randomness rather than dice roll Randomness uh where it's not true random you actually are you know you will get what you want eventually like if you're rolling a dice you could just roll a Nat one a hundred times in a row extremely unlikely but possible if you roll it if you're if you're drawing on 50 cards you're gonna draw the ace eventually

um and I feel like that that's the kind of Randomness that like either you you get something out of it you learn something a little bit more you you have ways to like manipulate it somehow

yeah good yeah my good bullet point for Randomness is is luck be a landlord I think specifically for that because you have that kind of uh deck based mechanism but it's still it's still like random but in a good way um but yeah I think like my other bad one not to not to dunk on Hack Slash loot again because I think we do that a lot but uh that game uh having just like Randomness to the point where like oh like I've opened a door into a dead end and monsters are kind of surrounding me from all angles and like what can I do to strategize my way out of this there's nothing because it's just I guess more on that dice roll into the Spectrum like I've just dice rolled myself into a corner by going this direction and picking this item versus something something like Cog mine feels a lot more agency driven uh there's probably a more scientific way of putting it but yeah I think like things like that kind of underscore it

all right well uh Cthulhu has has uh held back to bed

uh if you want to write into the program you can send us an email grogpodzone gmail.com you can find us on the gamedev.place Mastodon with grogpod at gamedev.place and our website where we have all of our goodies and stuff for you to check out grogpod.zone uh our next episode finally ah finally it's a Scott pick we have such a fine variety and array of Scott picks indeed uh uh this uh this next episode that's coming up I'm gonna Force everyone to play a jrpg roglay game that everyone seems to have pretty pretty neat fondness for called one-way heroics and will is confusingly Googling right now exactly confusingly Google I know it stands for the number four the number four picture that comes up with Google is uh Queen Frida you can do whatever you want with my body okay so I'm excited for this one uh yeah the the what this is a game that you can tell so not to spoil too much of our one-way heroics episode coming up but it's another solo Dev effort uh very obviously a a game made by a fellow in Japan uh the the publisher of which has quite a diverse array of other wacky games so uh there will be some interesting stuff to talk about for sure in our upcoming one-way heroics episode uh yeah well I personally am looking forward to playing a jrpg yes apparently

a very interesting pick all right cool yeah if you ever were playing a jrpg and you're like you know what if this could just be condensed down into 25 minutes uh boy do we have the solution for you so wow and only wanting running in one single Direction so that'll that'll tie up our Eldritch episode we'll put away the tentacle books for now maybe maybe for next episode we'll see a little uh and in the meantime to play us out from this episode will be the haunted tones of the Mountain of Madness preventing your plane from takeoff to somewhere more sane [Music]
