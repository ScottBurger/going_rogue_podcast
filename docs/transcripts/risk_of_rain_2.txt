I think it's time to blow this scene, get everybody in this stuff together.
OK, 321, let's channel.

Greetings friends, and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast, where in each episode we drop a landing pod in our roguelike game.
Kill all the innocent flora and fauna by ranking it and revisit those rankings at the end of our podcast season.
1:03
I am your gun handed captain of the podcast, Scott Berger, and with me are my fellow Cyborg Survivor Co hosts.
This.
Is the the?
Hunter Will Wright.
And the teleporting IMPH man Colin.
And Andrew is muted.
1:19
And the muted 1.
I'm just a cutesy monster design that you swear you've seen a million times before despite having never played Risk of Rain.
It's I.
Andrew Harshman and this episode we are closing out our second season of podcasting by returning to Petrocore 5 with Risk of Rain 2 released early access March 28th, 2019.
1:46
One point OD August 11th, 2020, and this is another kind of find it anywhere game PC, PlayStation, Xbox.
I'm actually kind of surprised you can find it on the switch actually, maybe after not after the late game if your switch blows up.
2:02
But this was a effort by developer Hope Who Games, who released our previous episode Risk of Rain One 2013, and a remaster of Risk of Rain One.
Risk of Rain Returns published in 2023, and Risk of Rain 2 is published by Gearbox in since 2024, who have since taken over the reins of the IP because Hope Who Games is no more.
2:34
They have dissolved, which we'll probably get into, but Gearbox I guess now effectively owns the game and the IP and everything that associated with it from this year, the year of our Lord 2024 going forward.
Risk of Rain 2 comes in on our data set as the number three most popular roguelike game on Steam with 295,726 total reviews.
3:08
And according to the data that I've pulled, your your average player of Risk of Rain 2 has about 221 hours of gameplay in it.
Now, granted, this game has has been out for years and years, so I don't think there's an expectation for us to put 200 hours of gameplay in over two weeks.
3:29
But but Andrew, you've picked up the lore entry for the final boss of the season named Risk of Rain 2.
What is what is?
What is the one sentence description inside that lore entry?
Well, there's so much to say, so much to say in fact, that's I know I'll be leaving some important things out.
3:50
But here we have a game that has been really, really impressive a long time coming.
A lot, a lot would would say a game that has has taken the originals atmosphere and and vibe and and ethos and updated it with with new graphics and and taken it into a new age of fidelity.
4:15
And stalker 2 is really just an incredible wait, thousand parts.
Risk of rain too.
Risk of rain too, right?
I'm mixing up my sequels here and I I unfortunately didn't get to play quite as much at Risk of Rain Too as I wanted 'cause I had been distracted.
4:33
But Risk of Rain Too is a a third person shooter in which you are dropped into a series of levels with randomized elements to keep the gameplay fresh, and you are shooting and blasting and jumping and leaping and exploring and above all collecting items.
4:53
Meaningful gameplay affecting items and building an arsenal to help you on your way as you battle the elements, if you forgive the pun, and attempt to make your way to the ultimate boss battle, which sadly I I did not complete.
5:14
But yeah, it's a third person kind of looter shooter, but a little more arcady than that, if you will.
Yeah, I think I was, I was kind of watching carefully this year to see if whether or not if we would cover this earlier this year just because I wasn't sure if this game would still be around at some point 'cause I thought, well, like, Oh my gosh, like it's, it's such a a I'm I'm astounded at how popular it is because risk of ring one I never really thought was really that super popular.
5:53
I think it's still in like, I don't know the top top 25 or top 50 for roguelike games on Steam, but this is like one of the top games on Steam period, which is freakishly popular.
I don't know if it had to do with like buying a four pack or whatever early on in in early access, but but boy, that that gearbox acquisition really kind of made me nervous for a little bit.
6:16
So I thought, well.
As it may as.
Well, may as well cover it for the last last one before Gearbox inevitably dismantles it somehow 'cause this game was like like super highly rated.
6:32
And then the The Risk of Rain 2 Seekers of the Storm DLC came out this year August 27th 2024.
Mostly negative review score on Steam.
And I think like to be fair, I think the the game that we have experienced and played was pretty bug free, did not have any kind of like game breaking things of like just immediately crashing or anything.
6:59
Very stable as far as I could tell.
And I played a lot of Risk of Rain too before that DLC and everything.
But like that, that was the DLC where Gearbox decided, OK, we're going to take all this Unity code and merge it between the PC and console codes, which caused, as you could expect, a lot of problems.
7:22
And for a while, like the game, like imagine, imagine something like Rim World or Factorio from like their Titanic position in like the Steam review ecosystem, like top dogs going to like mixed or like the slightly negative territory as a result of it.
7:41
It was like it was that big of a deal.
So two gearboxes credit they did dig themselves out of the hole.
How long did that digging take?
I think like at least a month, maybe 2.
That's that's, that's pretty impressive, I suppose.
But like, what a what a colossal blunder.
7:59
Is that the chess term I guess?
I guess a blunder is like one specific like mistake that is is over relatively quick.
I don't know if it's.
Distinctly different than a mistake so but.
They a they a big oopsie Gearbox did, which as far as I'm concerned, I I have very little love for Gearbox over there having having brutalized one of my favorite franchises, the Alien franchise.
8:30
But I don't know, I've not played any of their games for well over a decade at this point.
So this is my first Gearbox game in like 10 years.
And yeah, you're right, it was bug free.
But gosh, imagine how frustrating it would be to be in stage 4.
8:49
Find the the mega chest and then have your game crash or hit some kind of soft lock or.
True victory was the friends you made along the way and the prisoners that you helped escape from the rain world, right?
Right, this is true.
And the robots that you forced into servitude.
9:06
You fixed them and they were grateful to you.
Interesting.
Interesting perspective.
But yeah, so this, I mean, it is fundamentally a very similar game to the first game.
You're running around, you're finding you're you're beating enemies, beating monsters or whatever they are robots, demons, Imps, a lot of Imps, lizard men, etcetera to collect money, to open chests, to get upgrades and to become OP with.
9:39
The major difference between the 1st and 2nd game is this one is in the third dimension as well, which I do feel like is a bold.
Like that's a pretty big move to make between your first and your second game.
Like almost the point where I would say that this is in the Risk of Reign universe, but it's not.
10:00
It is one of the few games where I would say that's not the spiritual successor to the first game.
Like it feels like it's a different game in the way that you play it.
Yeah, what do, what do we call that?
It's not a spiritual successor because a spiritual successor, I mean, has to be like the same genre, but this is a side scroller to a first person shooter.
10:19
Interesting.
A rebranding, A reboot?
Almost.
Yeah, I mean, I feel like part of the the big you get the atmosphere the same, but part of the big feel of the first game was like your character Sprite is tiny.
What like 4 pixels, the absolutely gigantic world running around and like you can, that's definitely not the the perspective that you get in this one, but you get that third D.
10:44
You get that third D they do I I feel like it's difficult to capture the the that that scale from the first game where you are just so teeny tiny on a huge world.
The the environments in risk of rain too, are quite cyclopean.
11:00
They are quite massive.
So to some extent I I feel like it it it, it captures that, but obviously not perfectly.
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of Z axis change too.
It's not you're like you're running on a flat surface.
So it's very similar to the first in that sense where you're you have little jump pads, you're flying up into the air and you're moving around constantly in every single dimension.
11:22
But is that really?
Does that make a game fun?
You know, I will say.
Dimension make a game fun.
Does it make it more?
I think, I think in this case, yes, it does because there are there are a lot of melee characters.
11:39
I think specifically in Risk of Rain one that felt like I don't know.
And then in 3D in this environment, it's just it's a completely different ball game between playing the loader from risk of Rain one where you're just kind of like, I don't know, kind of you're grappling options are limited to something like this where you are literally spider man in your way across the map in like completely chaotic fashion.
12:05
And it is just, it's just on like a completely other level of craziness and.
You talk about craziness and chaos like it's good though.
It is good.
Like that's what I'm here for.
Like sign me up, baby.
Like the the chaos factor is the thing like once you've passed the 30 minute mark and like when you went so for example, I was just playing the the ninja character, the mercenary and I was remembering the times where I was like trying to ninja my way around and risk of rain one.
12:32
I'm like, yeah, I don't know, like this, this kind of works, but the platforming is like it's OK, but it it there's feels like there's something missing.
This one, I was literally running around like like Metal Gear Rising Revengeance riding mode, just like run.
12:49
It looks like constantly running around slicing and dicing to the point where it's like just comical to look at.
And I'm like, this is great.
I'm loving this.
I'm like in the air swiping at at enemies for like 30 seconds straight.
Like yeah, way, way more entertaining, I think, but I think it's not even just like the fact that it is 3 DI think it's like they made a lot of smart decisions with how it plays in 3D That like that's why it's fun because like if it was just like copy paste, like all the abilities are exactly the same or.
13:22
Yeah.
I mean, you have to rebuild pretty much every.
Yeah, everything from the ground up.
Well, I'm I'm frankly kind of shocked.
Let's downgrade it.
I'm surprised very surprised though, V period surprised that you're the one asking this question about, oh, making a 3D is that just make it fun.
13:42
You famously hate side scrollers.
So like isn't, isn't 3D just a bare minimum like for a game to even potentially be good?
That's.
Just one more D of side scrolling that he hates.
Now he has to forward scroll too.
Yeah, I mean top downs I I suppose are are very different.
13:57
But what are my top games right now?
Rim World's latest Fire Bellatra Luckbee, a landlord inscription war SIM Rogue Tower I.
Mean.
All 3D shooters.
Yes, but none of none of none of these are side scrollers.
So like the fact would you would you not I I don't understand what your what your issue is with Mickey 3D.
14:16
Absolutely none of them like they're they're all 2D or like primarily 2 DI guess Rogue tower being a you know, a a slight exception there.
I feel like it's actually that there's 0D, you're not moving in them.
Like like the spider is not 2D or 3D, it's it's you're.
14:34
You're looking at the wrong dimension, like the wrong dimension, because it's not about the number of dimensions for, you know, first, second, third dimension, 4th.
It's, it's about the focus of the gameplay.
And I like to think of fun as a, as a, a thing that is comprised of three elements.
14:52
That's going to be accuracy, timing and judgement.
And so and and where does 3?
Where does 3D gaming excel in this?
Well, this accuracy, yeah, accuracy and timing accuracy and timing are in my opinion, unfun.
They.
They well, I I.
15:08
Why are they on your?
Pillar of 100% Judgement and the only game on my list I think that is an exception here is Vampire Survivors is my highest ranked chaos game.
But that's the one where there's a lot of exceptional properties to it, But you know, it's so.
15:26
But everything else is just essentially, you know, let me take my time, scratch my chin and think about the next move.
Like that's when you're think, have a plan, execute the plan and it works like you expect or better, you know that's where you feel good.
This is the reason.
Fair fairpoint.
15:42
Fairpoint.
Yeah, 3D is not so, though you have serious disdain for platformers, 3D is, is not doesn't.
This is also this is also the reason why will doesn't play blitzer bullet chess primarily.
15:58
Then why he he always plays classical because you have to like stop and take 65 minutes per move instead of well, we're just going to make this move that probably isn't the right one.
And Oh yeah, it's an absolute blunder.
But my opponent also just blunder.
And now it's just like a chaotic slap fight with with slap each other with salmon here.
16:18
Like that's where that's where I think like the chaos of this game brings the fun is the fact that like you don't have time to make those like beard scratching calculations and like there are options to do so.
16:35
But I guess we can, we can talk about it a little bit, but I mean.
You don't have a lot of time, but like there's you go into a run with like some semblance of a strategy and and the first level is going to kind of inform.
The first couple levels are going to inform like kind of what your options are.
I, I feel like in my limited, I don't know, 7-8 hours of of play, but the chaos you're referring to Scott, let's be clear, Colin, you were talking about, you know, collecting money, killing enemies, collecting money and buying upgrades.
17:03
When we say you're buying upgrades, you're buying a lot of upgrades.
Like you just see at the top of the screen, this bar this like this, this wow, this ridiculous wow hot bar esque like sea of icons.
Maybe not a sea of icons, but you have like a big row of like, you know, you, you, you get into, you know, the, the 4th, 5th level, you're, you're nearing kind of the end of the run and you know, you've got minimum like a dozen items and then multiples of some of those.
17:31
And there's a, there's a lot going on.
And as I mentioned in my description, they are impactful and interesting, which we love to see.
Yeah, I think like most of them I've I've flipped like back and forth between.
17:47
I think one of the the big criticisms that I had when we did our first risk of brain episode was I felt like there was this one option in the game that.
So there's like these things called artifacts, which are like they're, they're gameplay modifiers.
That.
Yeah, by interest Stalker.
18:04
They are gameplay impacting options that will like change things to be like, oh, instead of you picking up items out of chess items drop randomly from monsters now or you can pick what specific item you want out of chess or monsters do friendly fire to each other, but also you and your allies do friendly fire to each other that kind of thing.
18:28
So the artifact of command specifically gets a lot of talk in the risk of rain broader community of like.
Is this something that should be on by default of like you being able to pick your your items that you get randomly out of these chess?
And I've I've flipped back and forth on this because the first episode I was like risk of Rain one.
18:50
Yeah, I have to be able to like to do a build in order for it to work, in order for me to have fun here.
I think I've come back around on it that the random ones, like the random gameplay element, I think is the way to play.
And I think that might be more fun.
I I think they went too far though.
19:07
I mean, you have you're, you're at exactly the opposite ends of the spectrum on command or no command.
It's either you get to choose any item of all of the items or you open the chest and it's a random thing.
So you either have 100% choice or 0% choice.
19:25
Whereas we all know Slate Aspire has taught us that three options.
Pick the best one for your bill.
There's your, there's your bingo blank.
Spot and that's The thing is they have that too.
They have the little like 3/3 option choice thing every once in a while.
19:41
I mean I, I think.
All the time.
Relative to the chests, it's what, 10% of the time?
Two or two or three like per stage.
I think it should be 50% of the chest.
Should be OK.
Like I think it should be a substantial, substantial amount just.
20:01
All right, maybe more like 1.75 per stage.
I think that's that is the interesting part of like you you when you say you were talking about trying to make a build, that's not really something that you can do.
The build just happens to you.
Oh.
No, no, no, no.
20:17
You got it.
You got to use those printers.
Yeah, OK.
I mean, you can use the printers.
You there are some options, but it you're you're pretty darn at the whim of what you find.
You're sure to to your point.
There are ways to steer.
It's it's the difference between you're on a, you're on an old car and you're going slow and it does not have power steering.
20:38
Of course I want a new modern car.
I don't want to have to shift.
I want it for me and I want it to power steer and I want to be able to roll down the windows and have it just just.
I don't want.
That's an excellent analogy, but I, I, I just, I want to make it clear you're not on a, on a, on a mine cart here you are in a car with, without power steering, which is, is better than the alternative, I suppose.
20:59
But I I get where you're coming from, Colin.
So I guess like so yeah, we we have like the difference between Risk of Rain one where your options were like basically everything was random or not random at all.
And like you didn't really have much of A choice there.
And I think Risk of Rain 2 is kind of split the difference a little bit with Colin, like you were saying that the pick three.
21:20
Well, I guess they had the pick 3 ones in Risk of Rain one, but they also have like these colored chess where like the green ones are like the healing items or the red ones are the offensive items.
And that gives you maybe more direction still of like, well, OK, this character here that I have these items that I have right now.
21:39
Do I need more support healing stuff?
Do I need more offensive damage?
Do I need like a usable thing?
Do I need just like an army of drones floating by me?
And I think that like the more that I've kind of studied the gameplay system, the more they've kind of come around to like there's there's the balance of the increasing, like the constantly increasing difficulty meter going on the balance of like, OK, how much time am I realistically going to spend like a grinding the map to get all of these chess?
22:09
And the balance of like, well, is, is any of that stuff from the chest going to be useful for what I'm doing here?
And if it's not, then you can just beeline to the boss and then go to the next stage.
And in theory, if, let's say you know, you roll the die well and you get a lot of items that synergize with your your character's base abilities really well, then you'd be like, oh, yes, OK, I can take on the final boss now.
22:33
Or you can start another loop of the game and continue that process again and say, OK, I'm going to try to keep this power bank rolling and seeing if I can run that risk reward, the risk of rain of how much time am I going to spend hunting for chess versus what's useful versus what am I going to scrap?
22:54
And like, try to like reformulate that build over time.
I feel like the scrapping mechanic really adds a lot of balance to that, that push pull system to give you to give you a little bit there.
Because.
And also, as I was finding out, even with the artifact of command on, you're you're sitting there like, OK, let me let me open up this little thing that's dropped down and pick from the selection of items that I got going here.
23:22
The game is still running and there is still enemies shooting at you.
And if you take too long to beard scratch, even though you thought you were overpowered, some little beetle is just going to come by and sideswipe you off the map and you're doomed anyway.
Yeah, so I think that like even even with the artifact of command and you getting like the base 9 or 10 items that you need to get your build overpowered at that point, like I was just randomly picking them because there were so many enemies on the screen.
23:52
I'm like, I can't, but there's not enough time.
There's not enough time for me to pick something.
So it almost wound up circling back in on itself of like I just need the random drop.
Yeah this game reminds me aesthetically of I was trying to describe it when we we had an opportunity to play Co-op.
24:09
We did one run of Co-op, lasted about an hour and ended with a very dramatic 1 he 1 duel between Scott as the pirate captain with his cyber peg leg and the final boss the king of nothing.
24:27
And sadly it ended in tragedy.
But boy was a dramatic and he gave him a run for his money.
I I think he had him down to like 25% health and then he like teleported behind you.
Nothing personal captain and gotcha.
Anyway, I was trying to I was mentioning while we were playing Co-op that the game aesthetically reminded me very much of A game that came on old timey bubble Macintoshes.
24:53
The colorful bubble bulbous Macintoshes.
And I've I've I found out, I figured out what the name of this game is.
It's called Nanosaur.
Did anyone play Nanosaur?
I never.
Heard of it like?
Like dinosaur nanosaur you, you're a dinosaur.
It's in a three fully 3D rendered environment.
25:09
You're a velociraptor with like a gun on your back.
You're jumping around.
Just the worst, most God awful platforming, most God awful awful shooting.
I'm going to record on saying nanosaur sucks ass.
I'm sorry.
Like even if it came pre installed on some computers, but I think it did terrible.
25:25
Just terrible.
What are you thinking?
Better off playing a typing game?
So this is like kind of like if if if Nanosaur was like fun.
I feel like I'm looking through some of these screenshots and you know, there there is a a dinosaur character in the game that that spits out acidic vomit.
25:47
And if you get that dinosaur, a jet pack and some some handguns, I mean, we're basically halfway to Nanosaur, right?
There.
Oh, yeah.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
The jetpack is on his back.
He has he has he has the gun in his hand like a, you know, a civilized gentleman.
26:07
God, look at that interface.
Disgusting.
Just terrible.
And like that draw distance fog anyway.
I thought that was.
Speaking of Frog, Speaking of draw distance, the environments in this game, as I mentioned before, they're very big.
I expected them.
So like the scale is what I mean.
26:22
The scale is big and that kind of is similar to the first game in in certain ways.
And but the actual map itself is like fairly manageable.
I described these previously as being big maps, but not huge maps.
And over the course of a run, you go through what, 5 or 6 of them, something like that generally on average.
26:42
And I feel like they kind of hit a sweet spot for like there being some exploration there being time to like run around and like maneuver and, and, and and and, you know, search for loot and everything without being like so big that you're getting lost or annoyed, which I appreciate for a long time when I like before I way before I played this game and I just looked at like screenshots, I thought, oh man, those maps are going to be a pain in the butt to get around.
27:06
And I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to like be dropping Jelly beans and like backtracking.
And it's going to be a pain in my rear.
And I'm happy to report that it was very rarely a pain in my rear.
Yeah.
And I think the difference here between our multiplayer session and running around solo is, is pretty stark with navigating the environment where the four of us running around the map like we're finding the the exit like bam, like instantly almost, because we have a a lot more eyes looking.
27:36
And then when someone pings it, everyone else is like, OK, yeah, it's over there.
In the amount of time that I've put into this game, like, and like my experience from Risk of Rain one, it's a lot harder to find the teleporter in this one.
Like you have the 3D environment.
27:52
It's it feels like it's maybe like a less distinct looking doodad than parts of the other map.
It's very dark.
It can.
It can.
It can hide, you can.
You can not see it even if it's on your screen.
Yeah, I feel like that's very difficult to happen in risk of wearing one.
28:08
Like if if the teleporter is on your screen you are you've clocked it.
Yeah, I I agree with the con, definitely.
But also like I, I was able to find a, a settings option.
You go into the settings main menu settings at the very bottom.
28:23
I think of like the main like first menu bar thing in the settings is like a thing that's has like an option to scale the teleporter particle effects such that like you can see them from a much further distance.
28:39
I'm like, OK, how, how easy is this to see?
It is way easier to see and it makes me think that like why is this not like an accessibility option?
It's on by default is kind of baffling, but I think the reason why is it because it, it's part of that gameplay loop of like I don't implicitly don't know where the teleporter is.
28:59
It's maybe like 3 or 4 static spots on the map that it cycles through, but it felt like that's part of your run is like navigating through the map to hunt like basically maze hunt for where the exit is.
And along the way, deciding how much time am I going to spend fighting, you know, fighting your MMO ads versus like, OK, opening up these chests and, and things like that and then finally getting to the exit, get to the boss fight and then repeat that.
29:26
But if you implicitly know where the exit is right off the bat, it I don't know that it necessarily makes it worse.
I I think it makes it better because then you know where to go and you have more of a little bit more freedom in your decision making.
29:42
But but I mean just in terms of an accessibility option.
Like I just want to know where the exit is half the time and then then strategize around it, it feels like.
I didn't feel like it was, honestly.
I didn't feel like it was too terribly difficult.
Like it didn't.
Most of the time I found the exit before I was like, I have to exit immediately.
30:05
Like a lot of times I'd be like, oh, cool, there it is.
I'll I'll hunt around a little bit more trying to get those last chests that are nearby or something.
I don't think that the maps are there's they're, they're not easy to navigate, but they're they're navigatable.
I feel like my biggest complaint is that you're pretty slow in the the first level, like before you get any upgrades, you are kind of slow.
30:29
It does feel like you're kind of just wandering around it That goes away in the later levels once you're you are faster, enemies are appearing more often and like you're fighting is more fun because you just got more stuff happening, like lasers are coming from your robots and missiles are shooting off of you and all that stuff.
30:49
I feel like a lot of it's it's slow in both the physical movement and the gameplay in the first level, but you can find you can you can find the exit fairly without too much terrible difficulty.
Yeah, I guess I'm just kind of miffed at this one specific instance where there is one map.
31:07
It's kind of already dark.
It has a high amount of verticality to it.
And I was already playing the the Spider Man Lady loader robot and just like, like ziplining all across the map, like it's got to be around here somewhere.
31:23
I know I'm looking for these little red fireflies.
I don't.
Am I going crazy?
Like it has to be around here somewhere and it took me, I don't know, maybe like the and it sounds silly, like it took me 5 minutes to find the exit to this thing.
Yeah, that's a lot.
That's like.
31:38
In this in this game, that's a.
Lot, right.
So, and I mean, I don't know if we've mentioned this yet, but the, there is a continuous time ticker clock on this and the difficulty is visibly ramping up.
It goes from easy to medium to hard to very hard to I, I don't remember what the other ones are, which is probably your means you're going to die.
32:04
But so anytime you spend in the level where you're not doing something useful is actually starting to become wasted time, which I like as a mechanic for the most part, I'm totally frustrated every once in a while.
But it, it, I mean, I am the kind of gamer, and I'm pretty sure I've said this before where I will, if you let me, I will go and I will make sure that I go the wrong way first so that I make sure that I hit every single little kravit crevice and nook and like, I don't and, and some a lot of times to the detriment of the fun that I'm having, but I can't not do it.
32:37
So I like that this incentivizes you to make that not the optimal gameplay choice.
Like you'd really do have to make like that is the decision of each level is when do you exit the level?
And I know that that is that is sometimes a decision in other roguelike games, but I feel like it's more the decision of that is put more forward in this where like that is that is not, it's not just, oh, it's one of the decisions that you're you're you're making as you're like going down into the depths of the labyrinth or whatever.
33:11
It's like, no, no, this is like a major part of how you play the game is like you.
Could I like it a lot?
You could spend all day in Dead Cells or some other, or like Binding of Isaac, just like grinding out the whole floor of enemies and you wouldn't have to worry about Oh no, like the enemies are going to be much stronger at the end of the floor as a result of me spending this time grinding.
33:32
Also, it goes the other way where if you if you wrap up a stage a little early, you don't have that guilt that that like completionist guilt of like I didn't get all the gear I.
Didn't.
Get all that because you can justify by saying, well, you know, the time I saved, we'll we'll theoretically, you know, make future levels easier.
33:53
And if you didn't spend all your money, same thing like, Oh no, I didn't spend all my money.
Well, no problem that.
Monday.
And it's not that.
It's not oh, I, I, I feel bad because I didn't like look through all the parts of the levels like, oh, I feel good because I did it fast.
Yeah, you did it quick.
Got to go.
Got to get it done quick.
Which I mean, you do get, I mean, you, you were talking about dead cells.
34:11
But like you do get some of that in dead cells if you're doing a like trying to do a fast run.
But there is never that break point where you're having something like Dead Cells where it's like, Oh, well, I'm off of the pace, therefore I can't ever get back on the pace.
It's like, well, I'm off the pace, but that just means I need to go faster next time.
34:29
Like I need like it doesn't get easier.
Like the difficulty level stays increased as you go through the game so.
Now at the very beginning of a run when you fly down in the drop pod, like you have to press a button to actually get out of the drop pod if you just like leave or you just go AFK with the game just like ramp up to.
34:50
I think so.
I think I've seen gameplay footage of like people just kind of sitting there and I, I don't think you take damage inside the drop pod.
I also don't remember.
I think you're, I think you're safe, I think.
I think so, and I don't remember if you get automatically kicked out out of the drop pod after a little while actually.
35:09
Winning move is not to play.
There you go.
There you.
Go agree there you.
Go but before your but before your drop pod drops.
Indeed.
Yeah, What?
What is up with this drop pod, Scott?
Well, this was something that I wasn't entirely clear on because in risk in the risk of Rain one game, Risk of Rain returns actually has a very nice cool like anime cinematic intro and Risk of Rain Returns.
35:39
It's just the exact same thing as Risk of Rain one.
But the story for that is like a a cargo ship out in deep space has been, you know, looting planets nearby you.
You looted the wrong planet Bucko and the the boss like teleports onto your ship, blows it up, and the people on the ship have drop potted down onto the planet Petrogor 5 and are trying to trying to escape, trying to find a way off off of the planet in risk of rain too.
36:12
Our story begins with a a very cool 3D cinematic of the of the ship's safe travels as it's traveling through space and you're you're coming across the the survival beacon coordinates of for a planet that isn't even marked on on the star charts.
36:37
And someone's saying to the to the to the captain, like, you know, is there any visuals the crash ship?
No, it's just debris.
Any any survivors?
No, there's the bio scanner is dark and they they the voice over goes on to say that Sir, they're the distressed beacon.
36:53
It it mentioned a lot monsters fighting and Sir, do you think we're ready?
And then the commando guy just kind of like looks up like ready for like bloodthirsty revenge for his his fallen commando brothers from risk of rain.
37:11
One.
It wasn't entirely clear to me if the drop pod that comes down is you like proactively drop podding or if like your ship got blown up Again, I'm sure it's in the lore because this game is nothing if not lore heavy in its Dark Souls style item descriptions once you pick them up and stuff in the in the settings menu.
37:34
But but yeah, you're you're drop potting in as tradition with a risk of rain game.
You are going past all the previous remnants, I guess of the of the ship from the first game.
And then in the the last, the last final boss fight level, you're coming across a a part of the ship that's been, I guess force fielded around and you got to figure out a way to get that force field off.
38:00
So you can, I guess, take that thing back to the mother ship and had we had we succeeded in our final boss fight in Co-op, we were so close.
We were so, so close.
We'll probably have to do it again.
But you, you kill the final boss and like all good video games, he starts a self destruct sequence of the moon that you're on.
38:24
And you have, I think like a, a pulse pounding 2 minutes to get back to that ship and secure it in a similar teleporter securing style.
But I didn't realize the first time that I had gotten to that point that you have to like boss is dead.
38:42
It's like rumbling alarms are going off moon detonation imminent.
It says the timer is counting down.
You're like, oh God, Super Metroid vibes.
What do I do?
What do I do?
And there's.
These.
There's these like, floating orbs in the boss arena.
I had no idea what those were, so I was trying to run away from them.
38:58
Like, no more boss fight, just Get Me Out of this thing.
The boss fight is in this enormous like Super Arena, but that's been force fielded off too.
So I'm up there like pounding on the force field last night.
Let me out, let me out, let me out.
And I didn't realize that I had to jump through those orbs that teleport you down to the main kind of part of the level.
39:19
Level is exploding and crackling all over.
You are Super Metroid running back to your ship, securing your ship.
And then I think every time that I've done it, I've had like less than like 20 seconds on the OR something.
39:35
And this is with all of my overpowered items and everything.
And I'm just like, Oh my God, am I?
Am I not going to make it again this time?
But it's always like razor thin somehow.
And yeah, you you escape off of the moon and again, in traditional video game format that you were greeted with a with a moon implosion where it just gets sucked into the void and you live on to see another day heading back to the ship hopefully.
40:06
But but yeah, that's that's effectively a run in in risk of rain.
But I think the the the the draw.
For high level stuff like doing that, you could easily do that on like the the Super easy difficulties and things, but doing so on Monsoon or the eclipse modes is where it's at because that's like your ascension levels for this game.
40:33
You have like ascension levels effectively for each of the different characters you beat one and then that unlocks the the next ascension level for for everybody.
So so yeah, and I think that's that's the kind of thing that like you can't use that artifact of command for.
40:50
You have to do that with random item drops like you.
It's basically just like play the game base level, but with some extra challenge modifiers tied onto it.
So I think that's where the big draw is, is like, how do you how do you go through these eclipse levels?
41:07
How do you like understand the the intricacies of the engineer plopping down turrets and then hiding in a force bubble and then sipping on a Mai Tai while the turrets do all the work for you?
That that's how the players get the 200 hours.
Yeah, exactly.
41:22
Yeah, Well, I mean, to be fair, like the game's been out a while.
There's been a couple big DLC content drops for it.
Scott, do you have any of the DLCS?
And some of them even worked.
I do not have any of the DLCS, shamefully, but because I think that like at the time I was like, well, I don't know, like the base game just feels so complete already that I haven't, I don't know that I've really hit that wall yet of OK, I need more stuff to do because there's we have a bunch of characters who returned from the first game.
41:55
We have a bunch of characters that are new to this game and we have like 4, maybe 5 new characters from DLC releases.
And I feel like I barely even scratched the surface with just the ones from the base game even.
Yeah, I didn't mean I didn't get any of the DLCS, but I feel like the biggest thing that from looking at them that they would add is just more levels.
42:17
So that was that's one of the things I was a little disappointed at is they're not randomly generated, right?
Yes, yeah.
So they're, they're static maps.
I mean, I didn't really play enough to to for that to be a true game changer.
Like they were random enough to me, but they were, you know, there's only three levels to start with, like for three options from the first level.
42:41
So if you die and you're like, OK, I'm back to the same level, which I don't know, I felt a little bit less fun.
I think that it it probably didn't really matter in the amount of time that I played, but I think having the DLC to have like boost that up to a couple more levels adds a little bit more variety of like, you know, it's literally a different environment.
43:05
So I think that's probably where I would like I I probably should have bought the DLC and been playing like, you know, if, if the difference between a one three chance and a one six chance.
I hadn't seen map is quite.
Different there are I'll say this for DLC.
So I think there's a way to preview it in a way.
43:21
So there's this one.
Another kind of new addition to risk of brain too, are things called prismatic trials, which are a it's like a speed run mode for the game where your goal is to beat just two stages and I think it's random every time.
43:39
I don't know if it starts you on like the first stage and then like or like one of the first stages and then one of the second stages always, but I was like, what the hell is this stage?
I've never seen this one.
It it lets you play through the DLC stages because it's it's a fixed seed for everybody in the risk of rain.
43:57
Playing something maybe that you don't even own.
That and I believe you can if I remember right, I think the item drops are also from the DLC and I think you might be able to use the DLC characters for that also so I, if I remember right, I think that's a way to be like OK, yeah like the it's like a fixed seed for the day.
44:19
I think you can try it any number of times that you want and then just see what your high score is.
But but yeah, like it's like effectively everything, everything unlocked go nuts.
Not gated by any DLC stuff because yeah, like the one level is like, definitely never seen this before.
44:36
Oh, this is the DLC thing.
Oh, this is kind of nice.
Like I could definitely see the appeal with that.
And yeah, like, and like similarly in the vein of of dead Cells, you know, that has like the other environments, the different biomes, the more stuff to add to your loot table.
44:52
Yeah, It, it just feels like like a good idea for like those things to help to like increase your toy box basically.
But so far, like, I'm still, I'm still trying to figure out how how some of these characters work and.
45:09
Yeah, No, I think that there's looking at the differences between the DLCS and the base game.
I think the base game has plenty of characters that to to wet your whistle for at least the amount of time that we're going to play in two weeks.
And then yeah, the DLC adds a couple more.
45:27
But I mean I think you start off with what, like 8 characters that you could unlock?
Yeah, returning for Risk of Rain 2 are the friendly commando from the from the intro we have Huntress, who I think I've spent the most time with.
45:43
Bandit your Cyborg cowboy Mercenary your Cyborg Ninja your engineer.
Enough said.
Acrid your your toxic barfing poison dog loader the the suit from alien that punches the queen out out the back of the spaceship.
46:05
And then one of the DLC characters is the chef robot.
The new ones for risk of ring 2 are multi just a a robot with a nail gun.
You have Rex which everyone hates.
You have the the the Cyborg captain.
46:23
You have 1 character that you you can only play as once you've collected all the equipment to transform into that character during your run called the Heretic, which is supposed to be super OP.
But the DLC characters are also interesting.
46:41
There's a void fiend character that I don't really know a whole lot about.
The rail gunner character.
She's a rework of the sniper character from risk of rain one effectively kind of the same deal.
The sniper type character very much like zoom in skill shot off your way to to victory for risk of rain 2.
47:02
And then the most recent DLC has the seeker and the false son, who I think false son is like one of the bosses of the DLC that once you beat them, they can join your party.
And then it's the the meme of like, you know, the boss when you fight them, super overpowered, the boss when they join your party, like pathetic.
47:19
Weakling.
Yeah, but you, you blew off all their armor and now they're like a little they, they out of the, their corpse emerges an egg, and it's like a cutesy version of it.
Yeah, let's be clear, Scott.
Which one of those did you say people hate Rex?
Yeah, Rex, I think is is the I don't know if it's because the play style for this character is very different or what, but like you see, and again, like I'm going off of like all of the risk of rain eclipse tier 8 or like level 8 tier list guides, you see, and like some of them.
47:54
Oh, and then of course, I'm I'm totally missing on this list the the artificer where like some of them are just like brain dead easy mode like artificer or engineer.
That's just like I'm I'll just like float up here in the middle of the air and just hurl super saiyan missiles at you.
48:11
I think Rex is the play style there is like that unit uses their HP for ammo or something weird.
I don't know if it's like their movement is also bizarre and like the just the item synergies like don't really work or whatever, but that's also the one that you unlock.
48:31
When we were playing Co-op, I don't remember, it was Colin or Andrew who excitedly picked up the piece of equipment off of the drop pod.
Like, yes, that was me.
That'd be me.
But the piece of equipment that if you take too much burst damage, it'll like that will set off the equipment bomb that you've just picked up.
48:48
If you are brave enough to take that to what I think like one of the OR it's the Abyssal depth stage four or five, the the broken Rex unit sits on that stage kind of in the top middle area.
49:04
If you go there.
Yeah, you just have to like carry that piece of equipment and not get bursted through a bunch of stages.
Put it in.
Hooray.
You've unlocked the Rex unit that everyone hates.
That no one wants to use well, to, to on this topic, the, the characters all, at least the ones I played with, felt distinct, but but still like, you know, enjoyable.
49:29
And I was, I was kind of reluctant to, to try any other character other than the commando.
And once I finally did, I'll be here for very short periods of time.
I was I was impressed with how quick they were to pick up, but how distinct they were and how like immediately like fun.
49:46
How much, how much immediate fun I was having.
I didn't like multi.
Which one's that?
That's the yeah, that's the nail gun robot.
And Colin, is that because you, like me, also didn't realize that you could toggle your your left click ability between?
50:02
The first time I played yes absolutely and I was like this is so weak I don't understand.
I just lost but I don't know.
He felt slow.
I've only played with the 1st 4 characters so.
So let me get this straight.
His primary fire is a toggle weapon.
50:19
It's like a nail gun that like you hold down, you hold down to like auto shoot and has bad accuracy.
But when you stop shooting it like shotgun bursts and then your your utility abilities like flips of that to almost kind of like the half life sniper, like the Super heated sniper iron rod shooter.
50:46
Sure.
Yeah, the the rebar crossbow, OK.
And the the Sprint for, for it like turn like huddles up into like a little ball and then just like hurls itself forward super fast and like almost uncontrollably.
51:02
Yeah, that's the one that I didn't.
I didn't really like the Sprint part.
Yeah.
Sounds.
'Cause you're acting like a bowling ball, basically.
Yeah, bowling ball.
I didn't really like the nail gun one.
I liked the the rail, the rail, rail rebar and so it felt like they were very opposite ends of the spectrum.
51:22
Like 1 is you're trying to like snipe from far away and the other one's you have to be close and smash.
But this is a tangent.
This is a tangent.
This wide variety of movement and combat style, I would, I would say it's, it's probably an argument for having moved it to 3D.
51:41
You've, you've got, you know, with all these wet and wild dimensions, so much opportunity to explore different gameplay styles and abilities and things of that nature.
Can we all just agree that third person view is the worst idea ever?
51:59
I mean, I know you like Fortnite, but so.
But I don't give a shit.
I think that all that design, that style, first of all the style.
Real quick, Real quick.
The style of shit and.
That's a strong, that's a strong phrase.
To be clear, I enjoy playing Fortnite, which is distinctly different than I like Fortnite to be.
52:18
Just to be clear, I'm throwing it out there.
It's very much a social thing, but it is also fun and pretty free.
Sorry, please continue.
I'm just thinking I'm just I just want to say first person is just always better.
I I don't understand why.
I generally agree, will to be honest, generally speaking.
52:37
I think for this game having it be third person is necessary.
It's so chaotic.
It's only.
The.
So my biggest complaint and the reason that I like Risk of Rain rain one more than I like this is access to the information about the various bad guys that are around you.
52:55
Like Risk of Rain 1, you can see everything at all times.
You're never at a lack of information because you can't see it on the screen.
Risk of Rain 2, it does have some level of like you can't see 180° -, a little bit.
53:12
That's like, if they're very close to you, you can see it.
I think if it was in first person, it'd be even more so.
You wouldn't even be able to see the being hit from behind or it's got to be like, oh, something's targeting me like a targeting laser from behind that's going to kill me if it hits.
I think that if you were in first person mode, you'd have to really, you'd have to change the way the game is played.
53:32
You'd have to like incorporate like sound cues or something to know that you're about to get like shot from behind.
And crucially.
Halo and like other games where you're getting shot from all sides, well.
Sure, but Halo is a vastly different game than this.
Like you're not.
You're fighting like three guys at a time and you're trying to like be a little tactical.
53:50
Like this game relies on you becoming overpowered and like fighting off hordes.
One of the one of the principal motivators for the devs to try to do a 3D game also was that they wanted to try to see if they could get like the items that you pick up to be attached and like visibly shown on your character's model.
54:15
Which I love.
That's which I think would be hard to do in first person I.
Think it's a nice thing to, I mean being able to see your character is like a visual flair perk.
But I mean I'm going to take it back to my my classic.
54:31
If this game had no style, would it still be fun to play?
Strip away all good art assets and rely only on mechanics.
I think that you still need to have a third person view in order for it to be a a playable game with this level of enemies and things shooting you from behind.
54:50
Well, that that just that is.
You you need to.
Not have the enemies the that style of gameplay and that's that's kind of instructing you really the only time you want third person is there's only one game in that I can think of that where this is a good idea.
It's called Rocket League.
And I'll tell you why you need to have third person because you're spinning around.
55:08
If you're first person in the car and you're doing fucking somersaults like is you're just not going to you can't you're.
That's the only reason is because you're.
Well, they also got the stomach.
They also do it because they want you to have a reason to buy skins and if you can't see your car all the time then you can't know how cool your car looks.
55:25
But but to be clear, a game in which you are using the body of your car to maneuver a giant ball always was going to be third person from from jump.
Oh man, Can you imagine if you were actually a driver in that car, how hard it would be to do any of the stuff?
55:40
Like either the ball is on top of your car and you can't see it, or the ball is in front of your car and you can't see anything else.
Or or any of the time they did like the boost forward flipping stuff and then your your screen is just like a disaster of movement.
There are actually condemned prisoners in all of those Rocket League cards to be.
55:58
Clear Metal 6 Rocket League.
Well, I, I will tell you that my, my personal preference is generally for a first person perspective in action games.
But just like, I don't know, there's just there's certain gameplay types and it and it starts from like the design document.
It's like foundational, just some games.
56:14
They got to be, they got to be third person.
But when there are two games presented to me, like, hey, you know, it could work either way.
I, I, I tend to agree with with going into first person.
That was my hold up with pub G for a long time.
It's like, well, I want to play first person and I want to be locked in.
And so I didn't actually play it until they had first person only servers, but that's more did will do you play?
56:37
This is a very interesting topic of conversation, one that I don't think we have time do.
You play explorer?
No, I think we have all.
I don't like the season, baby.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
No, I, I despise the third person of you.
As we're talking about this though, I will say I did think about the game Valheim, and that's a game that I rate very highly that is in third person that does have, I won't say cartoony, but like less realism.
57:06
Why is that one better?
Well, it's a survival crafting game.
This is on, yeah, building stuff.
And so, you know, being able to see where you are in relation to that stuff, probably useful.
But then you think about Minecraft and you think, well, you don't actually need to have third person so.
Well, that was just to show off the amazing hand models, which I know all you fellows are are great fans of a horribly blocky and and rudimentary hand models.
57:31
Famously something no one else remembers but I won't let go ironically.
Hey, on the topic of aesthetics, Valheim is an interesting comparison.
Obviously it doesn't look exactly like this game, but like they both have a similar kind of stylized, vaguely cartoonish, unrealistic art style.
57:49
What do we think of the art direction?
I think the art direction of this game is really good.
I like the I think.
I think will giving a big.
Strong reaction on the.
Webcam I I really like the art direction for the first game a lot 'cause I think that like it has this like overwhelmingly huge alien like crunchy like heavy pixel art aspect to it that really that I really vibe with a lot.
58:16
It has like this really like gritty, dirty sci-fi aspect to it and this game is it feels like much more smooth and low Poly, which like it doesn't it doesn't feel quite the same as the first one, but I think it's still matches like aesthetically for the most part.
58:37
I think like the the level design is very atmospheric and Moody.
I think the the character designs are just as good as they were in the first one.
All the enemy designs are kind of the same and yeah have that kind of like low Poly aesthetic to them.
58:56
And the music I think somehow is even better than the first one.
But I'll let others speak to their artistic thoughts.
I I want to just put out real quick.
Generally speaking, I like the aesthetics.
I'm so I think you know, if you know me personally, you know usually when I first introduce myself, this usually comes up.
59:20
Everybody knows that I I really despise spherical helmet designs in sci-fi really hate it, really hate it.
This is but the commando.
He looks good.
He's, he's the exception and I applaud them for, for, for that.
59:35
Especially when you get the little the little sunglasses on them.
Sunglasses and all that stuff.
Yeah, definitely.
Can you give me?
The example of what you hate.
It, it, it rarely comes up, you know, every once in a while come across like a a video game or like an anime or something where it's like, yeah, just like in this sci-fi universe there, there is like armor where the helmet is just a perfect circle, like, like a diving.
59:59
Dark Souls I I'm thinking there's a Dark Souls helmet I think.
Not unlike that, yeah, but specifically in a sci-fi sense.
I just, I don't like it.
And actually, you know, this is so hyper specific in the Warhammer like kit bashing community, which I am a part of, where you take your Warhammer model and you customize it, that it's, it's a somewhat popular aesthetic where people will say, ah, my helmet is going to be a literal marble that is like inset into this giant robot.
1:00:25
And I don't know why, but I just, I, I do not like it.
Maybe it's because I'm afraid of painting a perfect sphere.
But yeah, it's just it, it, it's, it's not interesting to me.
It's like I I think the idea is that like, oh, it's so plain like this.
1:00:40
This really undetailed, just perfect round sort of representing the face is is is striking, But for me, I don't know why I'm just like it.
It's I I bounce off of it like that's not science fiction.
I need a helmet that has proper detail and it looks like a face.
1:00:57
Anyway, tangent done.
Will and Collard, what do you?
Think of these Gray fix.
I will say that I liked the graphics.
I think I'd like the graphics of the first one more, but that's not that's because I really, really liked the first one's aesthetic.
1:01:14
I liked how small you are and how you felt like you were truly very small in a giant, enormous world.
I think you lose a little bit of that in this game.
The world still feels big do.
You want to zoom out more in the third person view?
1:01:29
Would that help?
It's just a really tiny third person view, I mean.
I think that it would be unplayable if you were zoomed out more like you.
Have a little cursor that tells you where you're pointing.
I mean like I.
Think it would be less I like, I think the the IT would be less enjoyable to play the actual like pointing and clicking and shooting and whatnot.
1:01:49
But I still like the graphics a lot.
I think they did a really good job of if you can't.
You mean you cannot translate the graphics of the first game into the second game?
Like it's gritty pixel art?
That just is not a thing that you can do in three dimensions.
1:02:05
So I think they did a really good job of.
Very nice.
Would you know put a?
Would would try to do that anyway if you?
Recall I can only handle so many super gnomes, I don't need the PTSD up the.
Yeah, I don't think that actually does get the like, I think this is kind of the equivalent of 3D pixel art.
1:02:29
Like low Poly is to 3D as pixel art is to 2D.
It's the you're using a lower number of primitive elements to build your your world and you're it's kind of a, it's not necessarily a throwback, but it is embracing the use of stylized elements rather than trying to go for pure realism.
1:02:53
So I think it does a good job of translating it to a 3D World, not using the same style, but using the same feel.
And then they do make up for, I mean, a lot of the, the vibe of this is the music and the music.
1:03:11
I, I will, we'll get into it more, I'm sure, but the music is excellent.
And like, it's not exactly the same as the first game, but it's it's the same, some of it's the same and and it's just great.
Just some excellent guitar.
I mean, while, while Andrew and I were dead watching Will and Scott trying to finish the the final level when we're doing Co-op, just coming in like, wait, Andrew, are you are you at the same point in the music of me?
1:03:37
Is it like is the guitar just absolutely shredding right now?
And it was.
I enjoy just listening to that watching people play.
Oh yeah.
We were jamming out for sure.
I there is a now that I think about it, I mean, I didn't really love this game, but hell divers is another example of one of the person games and we played that one for a little bit, but it was a bit more realistic, I think overall.
1:04:00
Yeah, totally.
And so and I think, and I did I I liked that.
I think as I was trying to think of like other games that might fit this.
And I remember too, that like the reason you can't actually have the zoom out is because as you look up, the camera has to spin around you and and get close to you.
1:04:15
And if you are really far away and you look up and it just suddenly like it just gets really close, then it gets disorienting.
I imagine so.
So that makes sense.
I can understand why they wouldn't do that.
But overall, I mean these cartoon I.
Don't.
Angry emails averted.
I don't.
Like cartoon traffic.
1:04:31
I think overall, I mean, it's it's just if you don't have the budget to make high resolution 3D stuff with the purpose of 3D, from my point, from my point of view is the realism, then just do a 2D game.
That's kind of that's that's where I sit on this.
1:04:46
Interesting.
Just make it get.
Disagree, you know.
Well, there's only some of us can be right though, so.
You know.
Only only some of us can be Will, right?
I do really really quick want to touch on the mod scene again for for the risk of rain universe where I feel like I'm I'm a little like.
1:05:10
I don't know, I'm sorry.
Real quick, Scott, that's a lovely collection of mods you have there.
It'd be a shame somewhere to come along and say, I don't know, merge the code bases between the PC version and the console version and tie the physics to the frame rate and completely ruin them all overnight.
Pretty Daisy.
1:05:27
Yeah.
Yeah, how is that mod scene?
So I think like the mod scene is surprisingly popular for this game.
And I don't know if this is something that like rarely do I see Steam Workshop mods with downloads in the 1,000,000, but here from the risk of rain Thunder Store.
1:05:47
So Thunder store is like a mod.
It's like a Nexus mod equivalent, kind of.
And yeah.
And there's there's some other games that have their mods hosted on there, but the most popular ones on here are the the enforcer returning from risk of rain one with 2.3 million downloads.
1:06:08
The Star Storm 2 mod, I think like kind of collection utility.
It's like effectively like a like a fan DLC mod package as it were 2.2 million, a more expanded Lunar Bazaar, which we didn't really kind of talk about, but another sort of optional shop zone, 1.6 million, the minor returning from risk of rain one 1.4 million.
1:06:34
And the feature that I feel like another thing that should be bit baked into the game by default with 1.43 million downloads is something called proper save.
Which?
Allows you to save the game at the end of a teleporter sequence.
1:06:50
What a deal.
Yeah, I have a risk of rain alt tabbed at the moment, happy to report.
So yeah, that'll be that'll be a convenient feature.
Where yeah, I think.
I'll say it's I'm gonna go ahead and say it's unforgivable not to be able to suspend your game, especially people have lives and you need to be able to pause your game.
1:07:11
Not if you play this game.
You don't have a life if you play this game.
Because there's some achievements, like 100% agree.
Because there's some achievements that are like, go, go on a run with like the commando through 20 stages, which on the face of it, like, yeah, that sounds like a fun adventure.
I'd love to do that.
1:07:26
Like somehow this game is like magnetically attracted for distraction of like, OK, I'm going to go for a run and risk of rain too.
And then the cat rolls in like after 5 minutes, it's it's play time.
You got to come feed me.
I'm like OK, pause, go and do the thing, come back.
1:07:42
OK, where was I?
Unpause oh crap, I got to go and start making dinner.
Pause, go and do the thing, come back like 2 hours later, where was I again?
The Steam Deck I think has a really good crutch for this with the suspend and resume button on it that just allows you to just pause the save or pause the state of the game.
1:08:01
You can come back to it later.
I mean, obviously you couldn't like switch to a different game.
But yeah, I do think that like for a game like this where each individual stage doesn't take longer than maybe like 5 to 10 minutes at the most, having that option to walk away and come back, I feel like I would spend five times as much time playing this game overall if I could just like stop and then come back or like, you know, OK, all right.
1:08:27
I've made it through that teleporter sequence.
A lot of stress.
I'm I'm going to pause here.
Maybe I'll go play some, play the Spire for a little bit, come back to this the next couple days and then resume the chaos like that.
I feel like is a crucial missing element here that yeah, I, I, I feel like I don't.
1:08:48
Have kids, but I have many friends who do have kids and also like to play video games.
And this is like something that they will just not buy a game because of that.
Yeah.
Because it's like, well, what if my kid needs something like I can't just be like, oh, don't worry, I'll come, don't worry.
1:09:03
You're screaming, 'cause you like smashed your head into the, the corner of a table, Like, don't worry, I'll come.
Just like, no, you need to be able to pause.
You need to be able to come back to it the next day if you want to.
I was I was actually defended the developer's decision here.
Unforgettable.
1:09:19
It's not a very.
Strong defense, mind you, But just to play the devil's advocate, yeah, Andrew, early on you mentioned the huge swath of things you're collecting and they all have weird properties.
They do weird stuff.
And So what happens as you're playing the game is you are kind of loading into your mental RAM, like what your build is.
1:09:37
And your bill is going to be a very nuanced thing.
If you put the game down, come back, you know, even a couple days later, you're going to be, you're going to open the game up and be like, what the fuck is happening?
I'd rather just start over.
And that's how I mean and I think and I, I, I feel the same.
Way you will start over very quickly when you die.
1:09:54
Yeah, I feel the same way a little bit with Slay the Spire because, you know, if you get super far into it, you'll have like 20-30 relics and you'll have to look at your deck.
You'll basically have to spend a few minutes reviewing everything to be like, OK, this is what I'm trying to do.
And then you can start playing.
That's why it's really meant to be played, in my opinion, on kind of a full playthrough in one sitting.
1:10:13
And if you kind of, if you have to pause and stop, like it's good to have that option.
I think just, but also I can understand why they're just like, no, you can't because we think you're going to hate the game more if you come back into it and you're don't know what's happening and then you die quickly.
The worst thing you can have happen is you're going to join the game and you just die quickly.
1:10:31
We just rather have you restart.
Maybe.
Sure, sure.
Yeah, No, that's reasonable.
Reasonably possible.
I could have been their mindset.
For sure, if you forget how you were playing your character then you'll just die and.
You'll then you deserve you'll be restarted.
Resentless if you just die when you like, I don't think that's a fun experience and I think if you're trying to maximize the expected value of fun, you might try to you know, tweak these these these principles.
1:10:57
Sure, sure.
Again, I don't, I don't have the experiment that we're measuring thousands of people and their experiences and their subjective.
Don't have probes into their brains so you can measure and.
Only if I just had that subjective well-being measuring device, I could.
Oh, that would just be.
Plotted.
Over time for sure.
1:11:15
I bet.
I bet the Lichter ratings would be really great.
Biker.
Damn it, I got to brush up on my my nanosauruses and also logical theory statistics.
1:11:32
What is what is it even this is boring, sorry, never mind.
Anyway, next?
No, statistics is not boring at all.
Let's actually, let's spend the rest of this time talking.
About no, no as we.
Talked about statistics.
As we discussed before, statistics is the phrenology of the math department.
OK, you know what?
We could get into our mind.
1:11:47
We could get into this of our.
Despite words.
Hey did anyone get the skull art artifact?
I don't know.
There were so many artifacts I couldn't tell what the hell I had.
It's the one where it's like if, like you deal extra damage to like if, if somebody has like like 4 things stacked on them, but that don't matter.
1:12:05
So, Scott, you've beaten this.
Game there's an artifact.
Wait, hold on, there's an artifact called Death If when one player dies, everyone dies.
Yeah, you gotta be on.
Your toes?
Delightful.
Hi Kurumba, that sounds like one I would joyously accidentally pick up.
1:12:21
So Scott you, have you finished this game?
Is there a ending cutscene?
I'm not necessarily asking you to spoil it per SE, but I'm curious if there's any more story content.
Not really I think like the the story content is.
More in the items.
1:12:37
It's more of like, yeah, in the item descriptions, the I think when you beat the game, you with a character you unlock like that character's kind of specific lore entry in, in like the, the lore drop down thing from the main menu.
But yeah, like the all, all of the, all the endings.
1:12:55
And that's one thing that I think is maybe a little knock on this is that like, well, beating the final boss with one character is the same as beating them with all the characters on every difficulty.
I I'm 90% sure.
I'm 99% sure because the three, the three or four characters that I've beaten the game with all had the exact ending sequence.
1:13:15
I mean, it's a fun ending sequence.
It it's really exciting to do.
But yeah, like the cutscene is like you just kind of like flying away, Super Metroid style.
The moon implodes for all of them.
Gotcha.
Oh yeah, you mentioned the imploding moon, but with no moon, how are they going to do a risk of rain 3?
1:13:32
Oh wait, that team's gone.
But presumably.
Beers box and some fragments you.
Know, I I was thinking about this.
I wouldn't put it past Gearbox to have some kind of MOBA style versus thing with the these character classes involved where like the mobs are like the the monsters from from the from the moon and then you're just PvP ING each other with the with the survivor characters.
1:13:58
Interesting.
I think that would be awful.
So that's exactly why Gearbox would do it.
Heyo get their asses.
I mean it's OK to like or hate games and also all devs go to heaven I guess something.
Like that?
I think that's but not all.
1:14:14
Corporations go to heaven.
That's true.
Fairpoint.
Fairpoint.
Fairpoint.
We want to rate it.
Yeah, I think, I think it's that time.
I think it's time to to rate our final game.
Judge.
Judge Season.
Two of the pod and in traditional fashion starting with the the lowest ranking first will kick us off I just.
1:14:36
Want to give it out of the way?
Yeah.
So this game is 3D into the gungen and we all know how bad that game is.
Oh man, look at this guy.
He couldn't even get through the joke before cracking a smile because he just how ridiculous that statement is.
1:14:52
Yeah, no, I I rated into the gungen A6 and as such I rated this game A66 is you know, it's it's it's not, it's not a good score.
It's not a good score at all.
I I don't I don't like these kind.
1:15:09
I don't like the chaos games I've already mentioned.
I just hate the timing and accuracy games.
I know we play a lot of squad, which does have to do with some of the that's a social game.
So.
Squad you don't have to like actually aim or anything though, that's the thing.
Right, right, exactly.
It's more strategy, right.
1:15:25
This is just Yeah, I don't, that's all I have to say.
I don't like this stuff.
I already mentioned all the things I hate about it and I don't, I I will never, in fact, going forward, I might make it.
I don't know, I might just not join for podcast games that have like our focus on this stuff because they just really, man, I know in the beginning of the podcast we did a lot of bad games.
1:15:45
That was the focus and I got it and like that was kind of fun.
But now I think maybe two years into it.
Bad games like this the third most popular rogue like of all time, I.
Just want to play, you know what, A lot of people are wrong out there.
A lot of people like bad things.
That's just, that's the way the world is.
1:16:01
A lot of people voted the wrong way.
A lot of people, it's a political box, but you know, there's a lot of idiots out there.
You think of the average person, you think about half of people are stupider than that person.
You got to, you know it.
Anyways, it's the rants.
I6I rated the six Colin.
Well then.
1:16:18
Big shoes to fill, yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
So I'll start off with saying I gave the the first one a 7.6.
I'm giving this one a 7.1.
I still liked this game.
I still had a good time playing it.
I enjoyed the chaos, I enjoyed the running around, but I never quite got in the same style of flow state that I got and the sense of like detached flow that I got from running around in Risk of Rain one.
1:16:48
I'm also bad at shooters in all their forms.
So it I'll I'll say it in some ways mad cuz bad.
I'm not good at this game and that does hurt my level of enjoyment of it somewhat.
1:17:03
And like I'm not quite as beard scratchy as as well, but I do have much more beard to scratch.
So yeah, like I think that it got it gets a lot right on the aesthetic front and in a genre that's not necessarily my peak focus of genre, the you know, the dead cells.
1:17:24
I I mean, I think I like the 2D platformers more just because it gives you the the precision of your controls is a lot higher.
Just I, I mean, I have it in, I have it in any of the like Elden Ring, whatever those called Dark Souls games where it's just like I, I'm not good at the 3D movement stuff where it's just like you need to be really good at all that stuff.
1:17:51
So I like 2D platformer slightly better, but it's still man, the music fucking slaps.
So that gives it like half a point right there.
So yeah, 7.1 Andrew all.
Right.
Risk of rain too.
1:18:06
Is it as good as Stalker 2?
Probably not.
Is it at all comparable to Stalker 2?
Probably not is does it deserve to be #3 in all of Roguedum on Steam?
Possibly.
I think this is a pretty darn good game.
1:18:22
I like shooters, I like wild synergies.
I like a game that I especially a shooter that I can jump in and just play and just right from jump start enjoying the game and having and and not just like, you know, mindless destruction, but like interesting, engaging shooting gameplay experiences.
1:18:45
I like this game quite a bit.
I'm confident and I'll continue to play it and it is coming in at 7.88 as my new number 10.
Sorry I had to do it to you world of horror.
But like, at the end of the day, it's like this is just so much more my type of game and just on average, like just the fun pure, like fun quotient was just higher as, as I was spending time with this title.
1:19:12
Yeah, I, I, I'm, I'm surprised that it's #3 that's like, wow, so high.
But like, I'm not I'm I, I guess, I guess it, I mean, if I had to take a guess pre episode, I would have said, well, it's got to be at least in the top ten, if not the top five.
1:19:27
So, so I guess I, I was surprised, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been.
Scott, take us home.
Yeah, this is going to be tied for my second highest game on my rankings at a 9.4, tied with Dead Cells, just at a hair above Risk of Rain one and just a hair behind my still #1 cog mind.
1:19:53
This game, I think is firing on all cylinders.
I think it was it was a risk for them to move from 2D to 3D, but I think it paid off masterfully.
I think this this game like really plays.
1:20:09
Very well between all of the different characters that you have, the art style is really good.
The music is even better than the first one.
It's just such an engaging experience.
Once you get once you get over that hump of like, OK, I actually have 90 minutes right now to burn specifically to play this game.
1:20:28
I won't get interrupted.
I'm going to jump in and I'm just going to like start slicing things with my with my Ninja blade.
Here it is.
It is super engaging and I yeah, like I was really happy that that the game was not completely torpedoed forever with the the Botch DLC and that it was actually able to be playable for the podcast here because I had a great time playing this.
1:20:56
I think like I bounced back and forth between different play styles and originally playing with the Xbox controller and then moving back to mouse and keyboard like, Oh yeah, this just feels so good to shoot stuff.
Just that that ending sequence of getting off the moon, even on easy mode just felt like such a nail biting, adrenaline pumping experience.
1:21:18
I thought the Co-op, the one Co-op session that we did was super fun.
Definitely could be convinced to do to do more of that.
And yeah, I think there's just like such an an interesting level of depth of skill that you could invest into this with all the different characters and like the community and like trying to see if you can climb that that Eclipse 8 mountain if you really wanted to.
1:21:45
But even just for me, like, oh, if I can just like get the the mastery achievements for all of the characters, like all of the all of like the challenges and like loadouts and things that you can unlock in this game are really interesting and cool and fun.
And I think that like, yeah, it, it just really sets itself apart for some of the other games that I have on this list here.
1:22:06
That number three most popular rogue game on Steam.
I think it's it's deserving of of where it is currently placed.
So 9.4 out of 10 for me, I think a good one to close out the season of the pod with.
1:22:24
But before we do that, we have to suggest some some other similar games, which I'll do really quick.
Our similar games list here.
Clearly there are ones that are that are very similar to this game.
Risk of Rain one, Obviously Risk of Rain returns.
I think play that instead of Risk of Rain one.
1:22:40
I think that does everything that Risk of Rain one does better, including some interesting challenge modes.
Crab Champions has a pause mid run button and it's it's a different vibe for sure.
1:22:58
It's a different style of third person, kind of like looty, shooty running gun type stuff.
But but it started as an April Fool's joke and it's it's very interesting and fun.
Gatekeeper is a game that's like like borderline, like copyright infringing on risk of rain.
1:23:15
It's so similar but it's like a 2.5 D top down twin stick shooter.
I'm pretty sure we talked a little bit about Returnal.
I think Returnal is shares some similar DNA here.
1:23:31
It's a lot harder than this game surprisingly, but but definitely worth checking out.
Andrew for sure.
Give your GPU a test with that one.
Gunfire reborn I think is is similar from like the loot and Co-op aspect.
1:23:48
I'll drop Roboquest in here as well, just from like shooty shooty gun games, one that no one has heard of, but I think is interesting to drop here for comedic elements.
Black Gunner Wukong is a game where you are an ape running around a military base shooting all sorts of really like cheaply made assets that just it looks like it, it looks like a really bad game to be honest, but like one of those like entertainingly bad games.
1:24:15
And I think it like goes on sale for like 2 bucks or something.
I don't know.
Ape Mayhem.
There's a game called Vellum VELLUM, which if I remember right, I think this is a game that if I can spell right has some kind of similar ideas for like Co-op ability like getting lots of ability synergy type stuff.
1:24:43
And then the last one maybe I'll throw in here as well called rabbit and steal was a big hit this year.
Rogue rogue style game in the vein of like MMO raids and there were times where I was playing risk of rain too.
I'm like, is this am I just doing an MMO right here?
And so I think rabbit and steel is maybe more kind of tuning in into that aspect.
1:25:02
But those are those are the similar games.
That's gonna that's gonna do it.
That's gonna wind down our second season here of grog podding.
If you want to send some emails in and brighten our day Grog pod zone@gmail.com is the e-mail for that.
Our Mastodon grog pod, a game dev dot place where you can see the pictures of the tree that crashed into my house when we were recording our world of horror episode.
1:25:27
And Grogpod dot zone is where we have all the rankings and stuff.
But yeah, that's that's season 2.
Thanks for listening for for this is where I usually like open the floor for plugs and stuff, but I'll plug something myself.
I just finished up a 7 hour tutorial series with the YouTube big simple for going over the the caves of cud tutorial and first few missions or requests that you do in that game.
1:25:56
It was a very good hand holding session of like.
I don't know what any of any of these words mean.
Please explain it to me.
And we just have the first episode of that put up today and I think the rest of them are getting put out day by day.
So I'll link that in the show notes.
I think yeah, the my my guide big simple was very good about instructing me on how to do things very patient for a game that's so alien and a a for sure.
1:26:26
Stay tuned possibly for next season.
We'll see if if the tutorial series does its job and we're able to be like, oh, maybe this isn't as intimidating as we thought it was.
If it sticks and could we please when we do do caves of Cud, let's let's maybe pick a week where a game I've been waiting for 15 years to come out isn't dropping when like, you know, there's not like a horrible windstorm.
1:26:52
Everybody's traveling, family popping in, left, right.
Yeah, we'll make sure to do it when either the STALKER Two DLC comes out or when STALKER 3 is released.
Yes, this is the perfect time.
Andrew.
Andrew, quit having fun with that other game.
1:27:08
You got to play this other game instead.
Well, thanks for for putting up with me fellas.
Yeah, the week that the stalker two DLC drops and Thanksgiving, the sequel drops like we'll be sure to play during whichever next, you know, big holiday gathering event takes place.
1:27:25
Very cool.
Hey, I didn't know about that tutorial series.
That's that's that's nifty.
Look forward to checking it out.
If you can stand another six to seven hours of listening to my voice drone on about nonsense always.
Yeah, we'll, we'll make sure to link it everywhere and everywhere.
1:27:42
And so this is where I usually preview for our next episode of our next episode is the return of the Omega Bowl.
It is our time to revisit the games that that have done well in various categories that we have ranked thus far throughout the year.
1:28:02
I don't know if I can if I can rattle them off just yet because I think those numbers might change.
So yeah, the idea is more like NFL style playoff nonsense of who won what division for deck builders, shooters, solo devs, etcetera.
1:28:18
And then putting him in a cage fight at the end of the end of the season to see whether or not if Doom RL really was better than inscription or not.
We, we shall see.
But we'll, we'll, we'll see what our, our final rankings are over the next week or so.
We'll see what the listeners have to say about about their ratings for games and then yeah, we will.
1:28:40
We will be crowning a champion.
Spoiler alert, it's it's going to be Returnal.
Don't even worry about.
It I mean I already know what the winner is going to be just looking at.
The list here.
So there's a strong, there's a strong contender this year, that's for sure.
We'll know when we get there.
We'll know when we get there.
1:28:56
The playoffs, anything can happen in the playoffs.
You never know.
That's what the playoffs are there for.
Indeed, sorry to start to broach the subject right in the middle of an episode.
We'll, we'll be opening up voting, is that correct?
How we did this last year was I had a survey that I sent out in various places and I was thought like, well, like that's one way to do it.
1:29:19
But I also like I aggregated averages between like survey results and like listener listener stats for the various platforms like Apple, Spotify, YouTube and such and like balance them out that way.
1:29:35
It felt a little convoluted.
So I might just do the listener voting like let let them vote with their feet or I guess their ears in this case or their download buttons and just have like the voter choice be based on what the most like downloaded or engaged with episodes were.
1:29:52
But but we'll be hearing from the listeners in some capacity.
Oh yes, they've they've sent in numerous, numerous agreements and disagreements with our previous Omega Bowl thoughts, which which were great.
A lot more people agreeing with Will than you would think so.
1:30:11
That's what I'm saying right there.
That's what I was.
Saying yeah, there you go.
Yeah, I think we got a good line up.
I think it's going to be it's going to be a lot of fun and most importantly the the Co hosts are not being forced to play any more games for the rest of the year after the Omega Bowl.
1:30:27
We'll be having a winter special of me doing a bunch of pre recorded interviews with developers from PAX this summer that I went to and I pestered a bunch of people who were showing off roguelike games.
I'll be doing that after.
So it's.
Time to go play 150 hours of Factorio.
1:30:45
There you go, you're free, you heard, you are free to roam about the cabin now.
But yeah, that's season 2 of the Grog Pod.
And to play us out, friends from Season 2, there's no, there's no better way, I guess, for for us to commence into the second Omega Bowl than with the The Risk of Rain 2 soundtrack that plays during the commencement stage, the final boss stage, the final boss of Season 2 row.
1:31:16
Risk of Rain 2 playing us out is is are some explosive synthy solos just before the moon from Grog Pod Season 2 implodes.
1:33:18
The.
1:33:47
Music.
