greetings all and welcome to yet another episode of the going rogue gaming podcast a podcast about roguelikes roguelike games and all of the above I am your host of the grogpod Elder lanerian Scott burger and as always I'm joined with my Rogues gallery of co-hosts uh Colin your hydraulic-powered lifter close quarter combat robot Droid and will your extremely annoyed uh uh risk of rain player welcome welcome to what will almost certainly be our most contentious ranking episode no I think like it'll be it'll be like straight ones across the board I think uh oh I saw your ranking already I know I know where we're gonna be uh yeah we'll we'll get there we're gonna strap yourself in listener we're gonna get there um as as you may have guessed we're talking this week about risk of rain the 2013 release uh roguelike game uh one of the one of the very earliest games released roguelike-wise on Steam back in the day uh surrounded by contemporaries such as Eldritch desktop dungeons not the robots fate and another big name Tales of magical uh you can find the risk of brain on Steam switch PS Vita PS4 and Xbox and it's developed by Seattle area developer hopeu games which is maybe just a five minute walk down from valve and Bungie down over here in Bellevue really yeah it's a it's a this is another one of those kind of like surprise games I'm like wow I actually forgot or didn't expect uh another game developer that I'm uh uh so in enamored with to be the Seattle area based uh which was a fun surprise uh hope it was also will can go bang on their door and demand that they make a better game are they still in business I mean this is 10 years later yeah they're coming out with a remastered version of risk of rain one sometime this year oh there's a shame I actually thought I looked at the uh I I looked at the it hasn't it's got like the steam wishlist page and I looked at it and actually I think I like the graphics of the original game better um but everything's like three pixels tall in the original I know you know what I I understand so risk of rain is a side-scroller platformer rogue-like-ish

sorry sorry I'm getting it you're stepping on my bit here right I had a whole bit written out and uh all right all right ask us what give us one sentence description well I also I also have the the alternating back and forth so that not one person totally dominates anyway my uh now that I'm flipping through the the carefully prepared script that I have for each episode will oh yeah I'm gonna ask you some a few questions here yeah in order in order to manage risk of brain we must first understand how do you spot risk of brain how do you avoid risk of rain and why will in one sentence makes it so risky oh my God the risk of this game is on installation that's that's really uh I mean it's okay I'll be fair here I think for a certain type of person certain type of demented uh uh really just someone who's sick in the head for that kind of person maybe they really really like this game but for us uh us people that have more than one neuron to rub together you know that's that's the kind of game that uh really just rubs us the wrong way and so um for anyone who listened to last the last podcast you know I was really looking forward to this one I say um with as much sarcasm as I can because uh Platformers in general are um they're a bad game design uh they're a big a whole a bad framework for a game and they went out of fashion it should have gone out of fashion as soon as technology allowed us to go beyond that I know I'm not answering your original question like okay so the one hand the one sentence sorry this I'm already just dropping at the mouse already um

it is a platformer that where you shoot left and right and accumulate things over and over again and you and you run away and you turn you shoot and you run and then you run some and sometimes you go up somewhere overhead vein is pulsing wildly and then you shoot some more with four different things and you watch cooldowns and then you die and you do it again that was a long run on sentence but that's that's my summary there I couldn't have said it better myself

yeah Scott you you research this more than we did uh what is the risk of rain I know it's a level but what is do you know what the title is I think it's pretty awesome title the title other than uh I think well so is the rate is the rain like the reign of debris from the spaceship that crashes from this guy there's so this game is interesting because like there's not really a whole lot of um like reign in the game per se yeah but there's lots of like little little like flourishes here and there like details about rain that I think like also doubly underscores that this was made by by two students from UW oh yes local local Seattle people who know a lot about rain and drizzle different types of rain uh probably you know just wanted to put all all that stuff in there but I think like so in this roguelike game as well has very eloquently put this roguelike action platformer one of the key features to this is an ever increasing difficulty meter that has you know your standard kind of difficulty measurements at first like easy normal medium hard um and difficulty I think modifiers associated with that they're also sort of rain based so like drizzles kind of like your standard easy mode um what's the middle one I forget the middle one but the hardest one is Monsoon and I think the rain here is like the reign of bullets it's the reign of debris from your your crashed uh spaceship or Escape pod it's the you know the rain the your raining blows upon all of your enemies it's really a menagerie is what it is but I don't think there's any actual like I don't think there's any actual like rain rain in this game on any of the levels well think about think about when the actual phrase like when do people use like there's a risk of rain we're talking about oh you're gonna go out today oh well there's a risk of rain so this is like the risk of your day getting worse as a result of rain and so that's the direct applicability here is if you play this game you're risking having a negative time right now the risk I mean I feel like for you it's just you you seem to be implying that it's a certainty of rain oh yeah that's that's the that's the irony of it is it makes you think that there is some risk but in fact it is a guaranteed thing and it's just a matter of degree really between that drizzle and Monsoon of grief yeah so I would say that um I I've played this game in two separate chunks and I remember really liking it the first time I played it and I playing it again I remembered that it is in fact a spiky experience uh a good run feels very fun and often a bad run doesn't feel great and then sometimes also you just die and you're like wow I'm doing great and then you just oh whoops I got in a weird spot and I just die uh so there is that risk risk of uh I feel like there's risk of bad times but there's also a risk of like maybe rainbow where you get that good good feeling where you're like oh man I all my stuff came together and I'm shooting at like a million bullets a second and everyone's a critical hit and then you hit the thing that makes you shoot 40 faster and you're just an actual machine gun hours do you have in the game and like what's your how many wins and all that just general stats for just so I have an understanding of I think of it I think I only won twice I'm at like 15 hours I think I've won maybe like 10 or 15 times with 30 hours I was I had just wrapped up a a run before this where I think my experience was maybe kind of the opposite of Collins where the first few times I had played this game I was I was like neutral positive on it and for me it's just like kept growing and growing on me like the more that I've been playing it um this on like the complete flip side from will really scratches a lot of itches for me being I think like I'm more amenable to to Platformers than will is uh and the yeah so so I guess like the the run that I had just done very emblematic of what Colin was describing of like this risky behavior of you're running around you get a good run going and then maybe you take a calculated risk here and then it all just kind of falls apart I had uh I picked the uh character that I had never played with before the hondi robot or handy maybe it's handy because you smacked I'm guessing it's handy that would make more sense um and I was like okay like the first few times I played this game and mainly stuck with like you're starting Commando character with you just have guns you shoot left and right not not really that inspiring or different of a character um did a little bit with Bandit it's kind of like a Twist on it with the with a big Blaster gun um but this one was very different because he's a Melee character he's a robot a lot of different kind of abilities having like a pretty good run with it so far and collecting a bunch of items along the way and I'm just putting in I'm raining down a fury of blows on the final boss and I have risked it for the biscuit by hitting this special item that like stops time for seven seconds go in and like lay down malfuria blows on them but I had forgotten that the final boss has like this one kind of a BS ability but like again something that you kind of have to watch out for where like these little like insta death icons pop up around the screen you gotta run away from them I had reacted too slowly and I was like right about the land the final blow to like kill him for good and I got killed by the insta kill thing and my reactions yeah good Noob yeah skill issue but uh my reaction to that was yeah very much like damn I had a really good run going but I want to try again and I think that's the kind of like like there there's like an addictive element of like um power momentum that you get rolling through this game that even if you like you get instagift on the last second of the last boss like I am still very excited to jump back in and try a different character that I've never played before yeah it's incredible I mean I I there are certain games like Starcraft is one which is a completely different kind of game but like where if you lose and you're angry like I gotta play again right now like and you just you've got you like rush back in to playing it with the like like losing doesn't make me want to stop playing it once it makes me want to play more because I'm like I'm annoyed that my Strat didn't work I gotta do it again but better this time um and like I I I think I'm with Scott and that I like Platformers Hollow Knight is one of my 10 out of 10 games like a good one like a like a three year four a good platformer people are gonna be crashing their cars on the side of the road I think that the lack of that third dimension lets you just get such tight controls that you can't get with a 3D game and that's actually 3D by the way it's just the platformer left to right sort of thing because as soon as like because we're talking about this like because vampires are survivors love that game and like we're trying to compare like why would I love that game but hate this game when they have so much in common and this was really bothering me for a while until we we went through a chat about it but I think we yeah we talked about this a little bit off air where like the difference here is that risk of rain is class based number one so vampire survivors is like eh only man uh for you Colin yeah I was like is that our list of games to play I feel like since we've already recorded yeah survivors is on the list and well I think you'll you'll be interested in some of like some of the vampire inspired or vampire survivors inspired games that have been coming out and it's ilk also uh but yeah it's it is on the stay tuned list for sure

sorry I interrupted you though yeah so I mean like risk of rain begins with I think a a good cinematic that kind of like sets the stage for the whole game you are I guess a a passenger on a big space cargo ship lots of Loot on there it's on its way to some place um and then all of a sudden teleports in some beefy looking uh monster boss guy who just blows up your ship in two seconds very powerful probably want to stay away from that guy uh you select your character I think it took me a while to realize this but your character select screen is inside the Escape pod that's like the outline of like the character select screen and everyone has like the little Escape pod like safety harnesses on them in order to then they're like dropping down I mean I saw this the I didn't realize it was inside the Escape pod though that makes sense why they're all wearing crash prizes uh and class based yeah so like you have ranged characters you have melee characters you have um robots you have uh poison monsters you have uh who I would just assuming that Colin would be playing a dedicated engineer class of course I didn't try the engineer uh and they all have like very kind of um similar archetypes archetypes of abilities you have your main attack button that's just like the thing that you kind of spam most of the time you have some kind of Escape or speed or evasion ability you have um like a like a another kind of I don't know what is it like um utility I guess like a utility ability or like a secondary it's not quite the thing that you spam all the time but it's like another kind of secondary attack and then you have like your your special move so just kind of like your four active abilities um I know we were kind of uh just before hitting the record button we were talking about how much we love League of Legends but very much in a similar kind of fashion you know you have characters that you pick from they each have their own kind of Main four-ish abilities or so and you augment and synergize those with you know things that you pick up um in this case you know you're you're running around very platforms heavy environments um and finding well I guess depending on the modifiers of the game that you choose finding like chess finding things that are like it presents you like three options you pick one that locks out the other two uh and then items also drop from from bosses that you fight at the end of the level

but as you are you so you first land on a given level uh each each of the five stages that you progress through has two or sometimes three different kind of uh options to select from I think they're random every time I'm not sure if you have much much choice of what comes up level wise but that will kind of dictate what enemies spawn on that level and all that um I really really like the art in this game like a lot yes I like it a lot uh I think like well so I like for me I really like big um uh what's the word that I'm kind of looking for like uh the latest uh like the latest dude movie that came out was like very uh like large and expansive big expanded alien all of that good stuff like you in this game you really feel like you've landed on an alien world and you know it is very heavily pixelated but uh I think there's there's an aspect of grandeur where your character is so tiny on the screen like you said like three pixels tall and the environment is just enormous and I think that that's like something that I find very unique about this is that I feel very small in this very big world that I've just landed in and what's a possible downside of that Scott the possible downside is that you get to look at all the cool background art you get to see in some levels like there are these um uh like giant uh like glowing like uh being like humanoid looking being Monsters uh that just dwarf your character there's like there's like a disproportionate sense of scale that like like you see from like the movie arrival with like the giant like tentacle aliens that come in they're just like so much bigger and like just this like this big alien vastness that's just like you don't belong here I feel I get so much from this and and very importantly some of the levels uh adhere to one of my favorite tropes in sci-fi is the the [ __ ] up Moon Theory where like if you have some kind of like moon in the background that's like [ __ ] up or like blown up or you know screwed up in some way that that adds to like the sci-fiiness got that in Spades here uh I you didn't answer my question by the way but uh it's too small and you can't see what's going on there we go that is you just turn the scaling up and then I mean I feel like it's really not that big of a deal in this particular game it didn't impact my really to have fun as handy as handy you're trying to tell me there's not like sure if you're a range character you don't have things getting up close but if you if it was at the side of the if the if it matters which side the character is on of you because you're up really close and they're attacking you it matters very much that you can see which side that way you know which way you're shooting yes to some degree I think that matters Less in the end game where if you have yeah everything is just like a chaotic rainbow of insanity that matter is less because so I mean even even playing this on the steam deck you would think like oh my God it's so small I can't see a damn thing but like in even in that case I can very clearly see what was going on and didn't seem to be a problem um I don't care as much about the background world as you Scott but I am a huge sucker for pixel art where there isn't um like black lines around the pixels so it's like uh just a as if you tried to take a picture of something and just actually capture the colors with uh with some pixels so you know like something like Mario had will have like a defined Edge versus these have the edges are much more nebulous and sometimes it'll overlap and it'll be like harder to tell what you're looking at but I just I mean I think the style it's very strongly stylized and I like stylized art games um and I think it this has a I don't want to say it's a unique style but it's a style that isn't used super often and I I am 50 more likely to buy your game if you have uh this kind of like pixel art style and I have bought other games of completely different genres for it and been burned but I liked this game so it what it didn't burn me and I you know I enjoyed looking at it there's two other games that I think have like a similar art style was it into the breach one of them

there's like um there's like a uh other worldliness Associated to like the art design of hyper light Drifter yes yeah and dead cells where it has that kind of like dead cells may be more more like I guess modernized in air quotes but like um but yeah like hyper light Drifter and dead cells I get a very much like that kind of like jaggedy like rough but well-designed artistically done pixel art that I think just it just has that um Indescribable quantity that it just Everything feels lived in and it works for each stage like you know you're on a you're on a wintry ice stage Everything feels wintry and icy and there's like lots of little flourishes and pixel art associated with it that that feel right the how your abilities are drawn and like your character's movement on the screen even if you are three pixels tall like getting getting like a like a little three pixel tall character like how do you convey that that person's carrying like a big sniper rifle and then having them backflip in such a way that like looks cool but feels you know this kind of like lit it feels very lived into this universe that feels appropriate I feel like it's not it's not at all the same as anime but I feel like it's a it's a similar in the way that anime especially an animation in general can add stylization to motion I think a pixel art like this you can add a lot of like every motion is extremely deliberate and the way things move you can control all of the frames of a jump animation or something which is what I think appeals to me in pixel art in general is you can you can really specify like how you want everything to move and look and I think this game does a good job of like moving around I mean sometimes it takes too long but I feel like when you're really moving around like this I I don't I like the way it looks I like the way that it kind of even the chaos normally I'm not really that into full chaos mode where you can't really tell what's going on but something about the the chaos is visually appealing to me and not just like overwhelming with colors maybe maybe part of it is that it's got a little bit of more of a muted color tone for most of the stuff and so it's not just like here's every color as bright as we can smashing your eyeballs uh but yeah it does feel very balanced in that sense um I just had another thought of like another kind of like pixel art e game that uh lots of chaos going on uh and a stay tuned and a half for sure uh noita yeah pretty much kind of like feels inspired to some degree by by risk of rain yeah I haven't I I haven't put in enough time in a Noida to like get good enough at it to feel like I've I've given it a fair Shake but that's definitely one of those games where I am much more interested in it because I it has the same kind of art pixel style where the pixels feel like they are individual parts of the world not just uh an outline of of a thing that it they don't feel like Sprites they feel like the pixels are literal bits of the thing that they're making the image of yeah all of this matters almost not at all to me like you're talking you're going on and on and on about all these visual elements like visual elements audio elements all of these things speaking of audio so great audio audio far down on the list of priorities for me number one priority fun is it a fun game does it have fun it is fun and here let me lay out the the primary game Loop the primary like this is this is what it is imagine a plane a flat plane left and right and you sit in the middle of it and there are some things way off in the distance and they're going to move at you at a certain rate and you're able to shoot at them and watch their health like the little progress bar essentially above their head go down they're going to approach you and it maybe you'll kill one or two of them and then they get close enough to you where you have to start running away and some of them may be faster than you and so you have to just keep running until you can find some place to not be on this plat this this access this platform with them and so you can turn around and shoot them but you just keep doing this over again if you run away you shoot you shoot them you run away you maybe use your abilities yeah your invisibility or whatever but like ultimately you're doing the same thing over and over again you're running away attacking and maybe eventually you get powerful enough to hurt them but it's still like you are just aiming your character left or right shooting and like fleeing or advancing and this this mechanic is just so [ __ ] boring to me and uh that this is what this you guys are talking about being addicted between runs for me I had to take 20 minutes 30 minutes break because I'm just like [ __ ] I I gotta be ready for this podcast but God I really don't want to play this [ __ ] game again let me just get together all my willpower so I can sit down and oh and navigate their terrible UI because on the joy pad it takes 30 seconds for it to go from the bottom of the screen up to play so you're just sitting there watching and just knowing that you're about to experience this hell and then you finally click the link oh God and I gotta drag it down you played on a controller well I started with the mouse and keyboard then I realized there's four buttons and then the the controller is more I mean I played it with the arrow keys and the keyboard it seems pretty sure that's the way it's supposed to be played I mean there's no advantage on a controller you can't shoot up I don't think there's that much of an advantage by using the keyboard and keyboard well like there's no characters that rely on anything related to the mouse right of itself and this is why I just this is why I just went uh with the controller it does make a difference this is all like just to say that like okay the screens aside and like that whole experience aside the game itself like the primary mechanic is just not fun and that's my that's my biggest problem your uh you're not entirely wrong with your angry tirade but but I think risk of rain too did something very smart which was offer two different starting characters at the beginning discovering one only gives you the Commando where you're only just shooting and there's not really much of like all right well what like if that was your your only 10 minutes experience of the game yeah like you know it would be like okay I'm just running around this overly enormous environment of looking for this teleporter that's impossible to find just kiting enemies all day long and shooting at them okay when when does it start getting good exactly um but I also think that's a like that's a pretty reductive description of the game like it is you're like oh Mario's just move a direction and jump on things head and it's bad too okay it's another bad game all Platformers are bad right so I have had many games that I liked a lot that were Platformers and I think that maybe you're just you know what maybe you're just bad at gravity maybe you hate I'm good at these games I beat this game I guess I uh I gotta I I you just eight in five and a half hours it's just it's one of those stupid time like the little thing is moving and then you tap your the jump button once you get to the edge of the ledge and it's just a bad person it's a timing game timing games are bad I like judgment games accuracy games Scott you like timing games all right well depending on the kind of timing right Scott have you played Hollow Knight yes did you play at the time where you just had to go through the crazy platform thing and it's just something spikes everywhere like I had a great time playing that I I did not like that at all so here's the thing maybe I'm just different maybe I'm just built different from you because like I said like I said one neuron that you know what I mean there are a bunch of games that are just like don't even fight just jump around and make sure you jump at the right pixel and I I get a thrill out of that here so here's here's my hot take about Hollow Knight it's very it's it's it is an excellent game it would be maybe one of the best games of all time if a it didn't have a bad ending by default and b c d e and f that you didn't have to get the good ending by going through like a Super Meat Boy mini mini game level uh in order to fight like a boss that anyway yeah so Hollow Knight very good there are there are Platformers that are very good there are Platformers that rely on uh timing and quick judgment and reflexes and all those things that are all very good riska brain I think is emblematic of this and the the gameplay loop I think the advanced gameplay Loop that Will's not describing here is that for any given level that you're on you have to make the decision of you know do you want what what are you after on this stage are you after something on the stage that you can unlock meaning like there's there's environmental hints throughout the level like oh there's something secret behind here if you can figure out this like reasonably straightforward puzzle and maybe if you need like a jet pack or something some item that helps it helps Grease the wheels a little bit you can unlock a new character or there's like an artifact buried you know in a similar kind of functionality and those are things that will help to you know augment your meta progression through the game uh and really kind of like change up your experience so are you after that are you after items like are you trying to like run around through the level and you know fight off some monsters and get some you know grind up some gold to open up a chest and see if you get like an item that works for what you're going for um or are you just running straight towards the exit and activating the exit because what that does is when you activate the exit to go to the next level it stops the enemy's spawnings around the level and just forces you to fight the boss and like the enemies kind of spung locally you kill all them and then the rest of the stage is free and clear for you to run around but that like we talked about the before that difficulty timer your hunger clock is still going up and now maybe you're at the very hard difficulty where enemies will in future stages spawn faster they'll spawn more frequent or um they'll be of like tougher types they'll have like more kind of passive effects to them while they're you know like will they electrocute you when you get too close I don't know uh it really kind of depends on what what you're willing to risk on that level I really had to reach for that one and from what I can tell from people's uh like like solo Monsoon runs on YouTube like their strategy is just beeline it for the exit hit that exit you kill down the boss as much as you can whatever gold that you have left over go and grab from the chest unperturbed and then you know from there you can figure out what what sort of items have you collected thus far and how does that sort of inform your play style and I was a skeptic for a long time like oh all these items are totally random they don't have anything to do with like what the character I'm picking but the more that I've been watching People's high level runs of this and trying that experimentation for myself the more I'm realizing this game has like a lot of nuanced um bad luck mitigation that it doesn't tell you up front that really sinks other games pretty bad and I was thinking about FTL so in FTL you're going through a run you're like man it would be great if I got some Flack this this shop right and then you go in and then they just have a bunch of stuff that doesn't synergize at all with what you're doing I think part of the advantage of risk of rain is that hey there's so many items B you get them so frequently that it just happens to accidentally overlap and you wind up getting these passive effects that work really well almost regardless of your intent and that those really helped to um augment your your run in a way that doesn't feel punishing every time like it feels very hard to have a run that's screwed up by one single item not showing up if that makes sense yeah

well sorry go on well well so it sounds like the meta is one strategy then and in fact it was pretty obvious to me very early on it's like yes you open like by the end of most levels if you didn't make a b line for the exit like if you just passed the X you're like oh it's there let me go check out the rest of the level by the end of the level you have you banked up so much gold but it's just like okay that converts to experience but like and that's like experience is essentially HP but like yeah like what you're up against is that meter of like difficulty and so the amount of gold you get generated just from fighting the boss and all the Minions that spawn around the boss is enough to open up all the chests within the area of that boss and then get out within a reasonable time I mean yeah you might be leaving some things at the edge of the map but like it's much it's just like there's one strategy it's like you find the exit you open it as fast as possible collect gold and then open up everything you can that's in the immediate area and then you just you keep going is that right like and also like you're you're talking about like oh the strategy like there's just chests everywhere you're opening them up you're not making decisions you're making one decision there's one decision per level which is when they present you with three items unless you get an artifact I know you're about to go about the artifact oh it changes the game but you don't ever get it so it doesn't matter anyways I have not got uh this artifact so I'm just going through like yep I'm picking up everything okay this is synergizing not I don't know I don't know what the half the [ __ ] the things so the artifact that Will's talking about is at some point you get the ability to just change it so that you can choose any item anytime you open a chest and so that's the way I've been playing for this last group and I in some ways I think it might make the game worse uh because there are a lot of items and there's no in-game it doesn't pause when you when you open this chest to look through and there's no in-game information about them so basically every time I would when I would just find this chest find the question Mark I'd stop I'd click Escape I'd alt tabs to the other thing and I'd look through all the items to figure out what I wanted to get and try and figure out how they'd all synergize it it slowed down the game experience a lot there's another Binding of Isaac moment where it's just like this is bad developers stop doing this yeah well it's also an older it's not it's a little bit older of a game so I we can't give them quite as much [ __ ] well if you're waiting that's what I'll do it's after OG Binding of Isaac and before Binding of Isaac rebirth but you're right in that there's there's no like once your run has started there's no menu saying like um oh actually well I don't know if this is true I don't know if like uh during during the game when you're running around if you Mouse over the item if it tells you in detail what it does like oh this gives you plus 10 uh yeah inventory I think that's what it does yeah um because before you start your run there's like an item and like monster log stuff that I think all that stuff is really well done and and fun to like read through because there's you know you go into like your items that you've unlocked and it's you know takes you over to like the storage room of of the ship and it has them all displayed and some of them are locked out and you can hover over the lock to see what what criteria you need to do in order to unlock it um and for the ones that you you have picked up up and I think yeah if you have picked it up you know you Mouse over in your little storage area and they'll say like oh you know um here's like this this like fake delivery background of like oh you know we found this on Alien Planet Omega Delta and you know they were really pissed off when we stole it out of the monster's mouth like there's a lot of like kind of fun uh background to all these seemingly uh totally disconnected items where you have like teddy bears that block damage and sunglasses that make you do more crit damage like I think it's it's interesting that they have like these little lore Snippets in there um but yeah like the artifact of command is maybe like the biggest yes or no artifact you that you activate and like column was saying it allows you to choose Whatever item that you want for that particular build and yeah like before we we had this episode slated every time that I would play this game I would play with that command artifact on because I was like I want to choose the build that I want to do I want to pick all the items that I a have used before so I know what they do and B like I think these will synergize well with what this character class is doing but it does slow the game down and I think there's that element of uh newness where you're like oh I didn't actually realize that you know stacking 10 grenade launcher items on this character would work in this way there's like surprising stuff like that where if you didn't go if you weren't it had that shoved on you at first then you wouldn't know that there was like a good Synergy there to deal with and then yeah you can come back later and like artifact of command and just like select it if you want but there's that that interesting randomness of how the items interact with each other that adds to that very much binding of isiness of like run around you pick something up like okay what does this do oh that's cool it does this thing oh neat and then allows you to kind of progress further without really thinking about it too much and getting locked down in that cognitive overload well let me ask you this why don't they just do like a choose one of three sort of thing that's right I wish they did more of it because otherwise it's like it's either you have complete Randomness whereas it's you you choose you get you get one of one option or you like or you completely eliminate the fun mechanic of the randomness that comes from it I mean it feels like that's what many of this type of game has gone towards I mean you get something like uh Hades where you just uh choose which area you want to enter you can't choose your item but you choose the type of like item or Boon that you're getting right you could choose the you have the choice of balloons otherwise you choose the room or yeah you can choose the room and then you can choose sometimes you can choose like one it's been it's been a couple years yeah well yeah like if you get if you get like an Athena room versus like a heart room option and you go to the Athena room you clear it and then you get the Boon at the end it does give you like a here's three or four options pick one yeah but those options are always randomized and yeah I think like I think will you hit it right on the head where like that needs to be like The Upfront default for like all of the all the items on the level is to have like yeah like that element of Randomness is kind of important I think the command artifact does you know if you're like a sweaty try hard and you want to like optimize your build like only these items and I need to stack these as much as possible that's an option but maybe and this is I mean you know obviously like this game being like one of the 30th like roguelike's release on Steam ever yeah I don't know if they had really learned that lesson at the time so that'll be interesting for them to see for risk of rain returns this year how they how they learn from how other roguelikes have done it right now like is it a is it a straight remaster or like what exactly are they changing about it that makes it yeah different changing the graphics slightly changing the characters slightly changing how they get uh items I don't know

Colin you were you were rudely interrupted earlier before you were about to wax poetic about the soundtrack oh yeah it's good soundtrack I I feel like it's I wish that there was like a slightly larger variety but it's been playing in my head all day today uh and just

just like over and over again uh the start of the the the one of the first levels um they're quite they're quite mad you know well I thought it was decently good and I thought it fit the game well yeah I I love capital L love the soundtrack to this game I think the soundtrack does does a lot of lifting for like like playing this game on mute like it looks great it flows great uh but the music really adds that extra dimension of like big bombastic like other worldliness but like some you know symphonic epic metal like rock Tech you know I mean it's it's so emblematic of this game that it's got good Ambience the word you were looking there is before there is a forgettable uh no completely mediocre in all ways okay so that was one of the things I it stood out to me how boring it was I took I the music they have it blasting in the beginning because I'm like well the gameplay isn't great let me just throw you let's let's try and like mix it up confuse them with this and I'm just like nope I'm not I turned that down about I don't know about 20 minutes in because I'm like this is already repetitive and bad there's a lot of good video games out there that have really good music but this is just not one of them no you are completely completely insane so the soundtrack is done by Athens base Chris Chris tadulo and he has he has all of his um uh soundtrack works up on YouTube so his YouTube channel is super great to go into just to like see all of his stuff there and for Will's purposes here he has a uh like a developer commentary for his risk of rain one soundtrack where he goes through like yeah this is like you know my my music design uh for for like this track and here you can hear like the main theme you know played in Reverse at this part and I'm you know and I was I was kind of shocked my socks blew off my feet a little bit when I uh heard him say like he doesn't use any uh guitar for the parts that you would think you would be using guitar in this whole soundtrack how innovative [Laughter]

I mean I wouldn't say that I think that is like I don't know if I would listen to this music while I'm like for itself but I think it's a good background once you get absorbed into the combat uh like it's got a strong start to the level and that or start to the sound at the beginning of the level when you're not really doing much and then I think it merges well with the background of your fighting where you're like I am I am zoned in I'm not really paying attention to the music anymore because I'm focused only on uh as we'll put it running away and shooting at them and running away and shooting at them uh and but like with my full full force of attention so I think it fits well I mean I I just the whole game I like aesthetically I like the art style I like the music I like the way that the art and music fit together to produce this feeling of I just I don't I won't even say sci-fi or otherworldiness but like you're just a little bit in your own off in your own world like you aren't you're exploring it feels it gives me an exploratory vibe uh and I like that and then eventually you're just fighting monsters continuously and you can't uh yeah you're not really listening to music as much anymore then can I can I uh just expand on that word exploratory and exploration here for a moment because uh when I when I started the game I thought it was procedural generated I'm like this that everything here the platforms everywhere the little jumper pads this looks like something that like yeah okay that's got that going forward it's procedurally generated so every time I load a level it's going to be something brand new at the very least oh no that that illusion was shattered early on I'm like wait a minute I've been here before and then I realized yeah there are just static levels and yep they mix around where the teleporter is and where you start and like where the the chests are but it's the same level every time so there's a distinct Advantage first of these crazy Dynamic was a distinct advantage in knowing the level design because you know exactly how far you have to travel in each Direction before you've seen like enough to know that whether or not the teleport is going to be there so there's that but like it also just means it gets much more boring more quickly there like this is exactly the sort of thing where procedural generation works like Minecraft like this is where like that's another area where you want to have procedural generation like every new biome you go into should be fresh this game did took the the primary reason that you would use procedural generation and where it would have worked really well and they just said let's just flush that down the toilet and listen to something static we're just going to be boring here and uh we're gonna put all those dollars into the music it sounds like even though I disagree with that yeah I think they could have used a couple more variations on each level biome maybe just make them larger and chunk them off in different ways or something like that I know it's not exactly the same level for each region but a couple maybe it is the same level uh and yeah I think each stage has like one or two so like each yeah like each level has like one or two or three variations on it where it's like you know maybe like the Rope is over here instead of over here but yeah like generally the platforms are usually in the same areas like the shape of some levels are like very vertical versus others which are very wide um and yeah I think like there's a missed opportunity for procedural generation but I think in order for that to work you'd either have to make the levels considerably smaller so that like you wouldn't get lost even more than you already do um or that like again something that would be very interesting to see how they roll out with with the remaster this year like do they incorporate any of that stuff and if so how much and oh so coming back to dead cells so dead cells very much that kind of chunkified um maybe not procedurally generated but like the the individual like chunks are like randomly put together but like there's still like a coherent level flow to it more or less so the level has a theme but like being able to choose like oh in this part of the level in dead cells if I go down Into the Depths over here that'll take me to some other dungeon versus if I go up here up into this Castle take me to up to the tall ramparts like that kind of split level decision design I think would also suit well here for like oh starting level maybe if we go all the way to the left procedural generation in the way chunkified segments and so on having an exit that would be like okay if I hit the teleporter over here that'll take me to the snow level if I take the teleport on the other side that'll take me to the lava level that kind of thing yeah just more choices in general I think that you get some choices and you get a lot more choices if you use that command artifact but there are less you get variations but not necessarily meaningful choices to produce those variations uh being able to choose what level you go to being able to choose if the three different object or three items things was the default rather than a chest I think those would be good additions or good changes to this game for the remaster yeah because I mean as it stands unless you have that command block there are essentially no decisions you make or you get to make that one like that one chest out of the you know the 10 you pick up per level where it's at one of three where you actually get to see the outcome like yeah that's the decision that you make which is just oh oh not enough I have a strategy I need more strategy in my games I tried really hard this is most likely operator error on my part so I apologize for people who know how to do this and it's me just face keyboarding the whole time I tried desperately to get the risk of rain mod loader to work because there is an extensive fan made mod creation for for this called risk of rain star storm that has like like your typical fan-made creation just like an insane amount of stuff in it and for the life of me I felt so bad that I like couldn't figure out how to get it to load and I I felt really bad because I'm like there's a lot of stuff in here that looks really cool there's a lot of new monsters lots of new characters lots of new biomes and environments I don't know if that it fixes everything that will is complaining about uh but there's certainly like opportunities in there for it for it to try and I was just kind of bummed that like that like a game from 10 years ago the mod loader also feels severely dated uh I feel like if if the remaster of risk of rain returns this year has like steam workshops Workshop support yeah and takes all of that like level of effort out of it then if something like the risk of rain star storm fan mod is much more easily surfaceable and like you know people can put in those kinds of things that that what was leveraging criticism about that would be I think even even better of a play Space to help help with modding because I forget I don't know maybe you know we'll get there when we get there with risk of rain too very different three-dimensional not question mark platformer I don't think it's a platformer I mean I played it at least when it was an alpha so I know I know at least something and I know I haven't played it how it feels like barely out and they it was true truly Early Access I felt like it had it was like what one level for a while yeah we were doing one level yeah we're doing the co-op of it I think yeah I mean risk of rain one here also has Co-op that that we have not tried so I don't

would it just be do they just make it harder no I'm good and then

Scott want to go do some co-op um I could be interested in some co-op uh because I think there's like there's some interesting synergies between the characters like like the enforcer character has a big Shield the sniper character has a big gun yeah there's some interesting synergies there like like a ranged exactly yeah uh some stuff that's kind of unexplored there so yeah I'm I'm curious if uh if anyone listening to the show has experience with the risk of rain start storm fan mod please write in and tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong and whether or not if it's worth worth our time to uh to investigate but um yeah maybe we should uh maybe we should move on to rankings I think if if Will ranks this above absolute zero I'm gonna count it as a win oh yeah I mean we played some pretty Dreadful games so this one at least has like some mechanics in it that are uh of average quality and there are some things I like about it like we didn't mention a few things I think it's just really to call out like to having experience and money that you like from things you kill far away like come to you eventually rather than having you have to walk over everything like in some games that's like a perk like you know wider and wider radius for the magnet but like just to have it always come to you oh my God that's just such a pleasure they really did that one right I would have had to I would have absolutely hated to kill the thing that's across the map and then have to like go up a thousand ropes and platforms over there just to get like pick up that like a couple yeah that actually might ruin this game right yeah and so because part of it like oh it's big levels but part of it is like then it'd be big level to go try and get across my coin yeah the the actual rating I gave this is on my my one to ten scale is a five and five is below my threshold for recommendations six and above I recommend so this is I cannot recommend this game Madness I I did not enjoy it I gr I it was a grind to get through it so I beat the boss there's no you can't say I didn't try I tried really hard to like this game um you you put in enough hours that I feel like you did give it a fair chance and it's okay to not like a game it's when you first were dunking on Wills bad and wrong opinion it's fine when you were bitching at at it after having played like seven minutes of it I was annoyed well that those those complaints stood those complaints were there but the whole thing but maybe they wouldn't have maybe maybe that would have been a gem where you just had to polish it a little bit further and it was like one of those geodes where you had to polish off the rock to get the pretty crystal inside if if there's a platformer out there that I can like I I'm I'm very curious if that's possible because you when you're talking about uh what was that bug game the 2D one yeah have you played have you played hyper like Drifter that's a real platformer though it's not it's not a platformer it's it's a top-down thing and I'm wondering yeah I feel like it has a similar feel of you're running around hitting stuff and trying to jump across little Ravines or whatnot I'd be very curious if Will hates that game too I think he would but it like it's a it would be a test to the hypothesis all that stuff should have been left behind with a Super Nintendo I mean like I I liked Metroid back when that yeah well every game can't be chess I'm not looking for that I'm just looking for uh well I'm looking for sure I'm looking I'm looking for now but more strategy in my games overall like I said like I imagine a fun all falls onto the accuracy timing and judgment and so I need much more judgment so the point is this game I get a five which puts it on par with like Dungeons of dreadmore it's exactly which is a five as well it puts it above pineapple smash crew and hacks like a lot of the other ones which are go without mention but basically on my ranking scale then um that makes it uh number five out of 12. so we've played a lot of bad games uh 13. oh yeah a couple of ranks that are like repeated here so so yeah it actually performs uh in the upper half um despite all my criticism here Scott why'd you put it yeah I was I was walking around my house like tearing my hair out the past couple days because I'm like okay I really like this this risk of rain was like the game that turned me on to the roguelike genre I think I had played Spelunky before this and kind of fell off of it I think I had played FTL like kind of when it first came out maybe um and like bounced off of it I mean I came back around on FTL pretty hard uh to you know going from bouncing off into liking a lot but like this game has such like a a flow State Zen to it that there was one time like I don't know eight nine years ago I was playing this game sitting down in front of a TV just like booted it up and like four hours had gone by and I didn't even realize it and I was just like oh my God this is just like like absolute candy for my brain and I can't believe that like something like this is just taking all the boxes left right and Center so I was walking around pulling my hair out past couple days like okay my heart says that I like that risk of rain is better than FTL my currently number one rated game does my brain say that too like is it is it objectively a better game than FTL and then I was like okay what am I really ranking these by I think I'm ranking these by like how do I feel when playing them and would I go back to them so FTL on my 10 point scale has a 9.5 I'm going to put risk of rain at my new number one with a 9.51 almost as like a spite score a 9.5 plus wrong uh because I think like like FTL great game it's a classic it is a legendary it deserves this reputation uh risk of rain is not perfect there are rough edges all over the place but it is that it is that teddy bear that you have with the eyes falling off and like it's missing an arm and you just you still love to cuddle it and it brings you all of that joy and warmth and snugginess and all the tough times go away and you feel just right at home with it uh for me I think like all of those boxes tick so hard that even if it isn't perfect we'll see if like Risk of Rain returns this year can can polish out those those rough edges but um I think this is my new number one what's how many hours do you have in this game I have just over 30 hours

you're trying to tell me it's this old teddy bear eyes Fall Again are missing at 30 hours into the game well we can't all have thousands of hours into our favorite games I don't know each run run is like somewhere between 20 to 35 or 40 minutes on the long end and you know do you divide like that over 40 hours you get a lot of runs and like there's no way you're mapping this into like any better like this is like a game doesn't have to be good if like you get 10 000 hours of it I'm saying you can't you can't just call it a teddy bear an old teddy bear you can call this like a flash in the pan that's what this is it's like it's a teddy bear with the arms

watch a movie one time and really like it and not watch it again and still have it be a movie you really like Apollo Knight a game I've referenced more times than I probably should have in this podcast I played for 32.6 hours so I've only beaten it one time it was a perfect Jewel of an experience I don't necessarily I might play it again I might play it again before silk song comes out but I don't need to have replayed it again over and over and over again I'm not trying to make my favorite thing yeah no no like I'm just the teddy bear thing like Stanley Parable is 10 hours for me like yeah and I still think it's like a 9 or 10 a perfect teddy bear on the on the counter on the on the shelf for you to come back to whenever you feel like it you know it's a question um eat it and you devour it it was a good cookie but anyway for me uh I agree with a lot of what Scott was saying um for me it comes in at three out of our 13 games we've played uh I would say that it has it's it's got uh the rough edges I would call them spiky edges some of the spikes are very high and some of them are low uh I think when it's good it's extremely good and then other times you feel like you just die randomly and it's a little bit frustrating so I don't know if that's something I think that at least a little bit of that is just intrinsic to the game and a couple of it a couple bits of it is Parts they could polish off they they tried to but um yeah number three I liked it a lot I liked it before and I liked it again

okay uh if you would like you Gentle listener would like to write into our show and blast will about why his again very valid all opinions are safe here on the show uh and want to you know express your feelings about why risk of brain is the greatest game of all time or not you know as the case may be Some Like It even Rainier they want a certainty of rain brogpodzone gmail.com is the email uh feel free to you know Mastodon used to have uh their tweets called toots and I really miss that they changed it to publish now which doesn't sound as fun like if you want to if you want to like or was it boosting they called boosting if you retweet somebody uh you can boost us if it's just a post when you post something well you well a a Twitter post is a mastodon publish it used to be tude which I think is a lot funnier and matches better with the elephant theme they got going um but you can you can uh boost us on a mass and on a grogpod at gamedev.place and our website with all of our rankings and raw data and all of our good stuff there is grogpod.zone will you have have selected for us our next episode and so and thank you for the privilege of this election so I finally finally gets to uh choose a good game or hopefully a good game I've done a little bit of research and I think we're gonna like this next one this is uh fights in tight places spaces spaces is that what it was fights and type spaces yes that's the one and uh it's got a lot of elements that I'm excited about here uh it's a roguelike deck builder deck builder automatically you win a lot of points with me if you're just being a deck builder but it's also got like this like spatial element to it where it's kind of got this uh into the breach style um look to it and it's gonna or not look to it but like a um uh kind of a playing field and it's got like a very unique art style with a guy in a suit that's just like kicking ass so it's just like it feels like it's got a lot of good things and um I'm excited for it um for for our next uh podcast I think I must have watched the the Casino Royale uh intro like five or six times after that to be like oh yeah I would play a whole game that's just based around this

yeah one thoughts on this is it gonna be a good one I haven't really looked it up at all I'm gonna wait until I'm gonna you know go into it with Super Fresh eyes I trust I trust your judgment will yeah I will say that February I think uh we're supposed to do this on February 24th is the next one that um and so uh that's when Kerbal Space Program two comes out now this is a roguelike podcast but I'll tell you what next week that's the that's one the two two one oh that's two weeks okay never mind so that'll be the update for next well I'm just saying whatever we do for that podcast we're gonna have to make choose a small game because I'm gonna be putting everything thing in the gerbils-based program we'll just live stream you playing Kerbal for a while oh my God purple space programs are roguelike right everything I can't believe you didn't get that's a whole other thing we could go on a rant about that but you know if Kerbal Space Program 2 has a less um aggressively disinterested UI and uh well I'll get that I'll be getting to ksp2 with you no I mean not as much as you but I'll I'll put the effort into getting good at it it wouldn't be possible just give me some mission objectives give me a character that's three pixels tall and allowing it to just like here we go pixel art KSP mods get on it make it happen um but uh on that note hey Scott wanna go play some uh risk of rain Co-op yes we're gonna go do it all right good potting with y'all
