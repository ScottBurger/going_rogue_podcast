Greetings friends and welcome to the Grog Pod Rogge Like podcast Season 3 finale episode where each season we slay the hordes of roguelikes by lobbing magical grenades of rating numbers at them.
Send the best ones of the year up the well for the end of season recap tournament, which is our next episode.
0:34
I am your hilariously low budget voice acted host of the podcast Scott Berger, and with me are my Campfire Crowding Co hosts.
Andrew in the Hall, Harshman.
And I'm calling just your humble skull summoned by a necromancer shot to fight a skeleton summoned by a different bad necromancer.
0:56
And this is will you're a 32 by 32 Sprite.
Well, to conclude our third season of me conning my my fellow Co hosts here into doing so many of these podcast episodes, we are talking Halls of Torment released March 9th, 2023 as a, as a prelude slash demo.
1:20
This is something that's I guess kind of come into popularity recently of like, oh, here's like a demo, but we're going to call it a prelude.
And I guess it is like a more fully fledged thing.
March 9th, 2023, a little more than a year later, May 24th.
1:37
No wait, same here I can read May 24th 2023 is when it jumped into early access and one point O to September 24th 2024.
It's been a long season.
What platforms can you find on?
1:52
You can find this on Steam, you can find it on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and you can find the 2025 DICE Awards Mobile Game of the Year nominee losing out only to to Bilatro on both iOS and Android.
This was developed by one developed and published by one chasing carrots out of Stuttgart, Germany, who you may remember from 2015 Cosmonautica and 2017 Pressure OverDrive.
2:21
And of course, who could forget 2022's good company?
Well, they're in good company with the 2023 release of theirs for Halls of Torment, which I think has been finally their the success that they've been looking for.
Halls of torment the corpse ball for that one rolls in on the steam rankings at the number 51 most popular roguelike game on Steam with 30,557 total reviews.
2:49
Your average player of Halls of Torment has about 32 hours of gameplay in it, but but Andrew, you've encountered A glowing yellow tome surrounded by demons in which A1 sentence description is contained of what one does in Halls of Torment.
3:05
Well, in Halls of Torment you brave various halls to obviously you have to be tormented within the halls.
I mean as the name implies and this is a grim dark western fantasy game with a throwback visual style to like the late 90s.
3:30
Beautiful pre rendered isometric game and you get to take on the role of a bunch of classic fantasy classes and just wade through hordes and hordes of enemies critically in a auto attacking perk selecting screen.
3:54
A visual oh, feast for the eyes, which would kind of almost, almost at times, make Vampire Survivors blush.
That's quite the run on right there.
That was amazing.
I think we had.
I'll do that though for these.
4:10
You had a maximum of 30 minutes to get that that one sentence description out.
But yeah, this is this is a good one to follow up our previous episode of Diablo one with, because you boot this game up like visual feast for the eyes.
You get the the flaming, heavily pixelated title halls of torment, like catches on fire.
4:34
And then it just goes right into your campfire town and you you pick your your single hero that's available.
I did think it was interesting that I for a second I was like, wait, I thought this game was recent.
Maybe like when did this game come out?
Like, Oh no, it's a stylistic thing.
4:50
It came out like a year ago.
That's just how true to that art style they were, in part because it looks cool.
And also my understanding is that the the actual like man hours required to model up a shirtless man and render him out in teeny tiny sprites was pretty fast.
5:15
Pretty snappy, but.
The reason was just that it's was easier to process when you have like a million things on screen at once.
If that's a lot of compute required, if it's better, yeah.
I mean I.
Well, to be clear, I I you.
5:31
Could model the main characters in all of their glory, but then you still have to kind of like tone down the 10,000 sprites on screen so.
Like would this game be possible in like 1990?
I don't think this game would even.
Be possible in like 2010?
5:48
Yeah, there's just like a lot of like, well, actually.
I mean, I think you made a.
Resolution of this, it's like I know when I open the game up it's like this tiny little box on my screen that I have to full screen where it grows over 50 times its regular size.
I think it is like 480P resolution that so when I when I was, I put like all the 20 hours that I played this game on the Steam Deck and it was a fabulous time.
6:11
It looked great.
I jump over to my 1440P monitor here and I'm just like, whoa, that is some chunky pixelated stuff going on here.
It still looks good, but it was, it was a preview of me needing glasses in the future of like, Oh my God, this is what the world's gonna look like in five years for me.
6:29
Most definitely.
So obviously, I mean this is was developed, you know, knowing full well that this was a survivor like game.
Do we want to tackle the how it compares to Vampire Survivors right now or save that?
6:48
You know, like, that's one of the bullet points that I have here kind of to, to kick off that this is just like, it's Diablo survivors.
But I feel like it's maybe something a little bit more restrained than that, 'cause I, I, I was like, OK, we're obviously gonna be talking about this.
7:04
Let me boot up Vampire Survivors that I haven't touched in like a year and just see how it compares.
Booted up just like hit all the buttons to just jump into a run.
And I was just like almost completely overwhelmed to start.
It was already on turbo mode.
I had all the things unlocked and it was just like, Oh my God, like, am I am I just too old?
7:24
Like it was, it was like so overwhelming to just boom, jump right back into all the stuff being unlocked.
Whereas I think this Halls of Torment, I think does feel a lot more restrained in at least like, and you know, maybe it's an unfair comparison of comparing like, oh, the end game of Vampire Survivors to the beginning of this.
7:43
But this one does feel like it's deliberately takes its time a little more to to Stew.
But yeah, I mean, like the visual aesthetic is totally different.
It's like your Diablo aesthetic versus whatever kind of nightmare mishmash of Castlevania sprites or in the other.
8:03
One, I will say that I think.
That the IT it the end goal of your character Growth feels a little different too.
Like I always joke that the end goal of Vampire Survivors is to be able to stop playing Boom.
You just hit it.
8:18
Stand, stand still and everything dies before you could even see it.
And then like every time.
And yeah, it took us only 5 minutes to to mention that the the goal is to not have to move your character, which can happen in this channel, but not not nearly as often.
8:39
Not not nearly as often.
You really can.
You can or cannot.
You, you can.
I'll say that as someone with with nearly 60 hours into it standing, it's.
A lot more difficult because things are like firing bullets at you though.
True, true.
True.
You have to you have to have like your stand off distance has to be much larger.
8:54
You have to I'm so.
Glad that you are bringing this this up calling because.
Fair enough, I guess.
Yeah, if you're just out out healing.
Well, yeah, if you build for it, definitely, definitely.
But it seem, it seems like in Vampire Survivors, that's kind of the almost an inevitability that you're going to get to that point where you're just standing still.
9:14
But and you might think, well then this, this game almost sounds like it's boring.
Well hey, great news, Halls of Torment does like some some interesting stuff with the gameplay to occupy your time during that kind of slow restrained build up.
9:33
At least in you know your your first like 10 hours or so in how your character moves and in how the game presents different quests and bits of story to you, which is very much appreciated.
9:48
I think you guys are all suffering from a recency bias.
They're all saying that oh Vampire survivor is this crazy chaos things are happening everywhere this game much more restrained, slow build up.
No, that's all 100% a bias in recency.
Cause is, I'll tell you what, like once you get high enough level, of course.
10:05
Yeah.
If you, if I went back and I played Vampire Survivors now, you know, and with everything unlocked, it's going to look insane.
And this game, you guys are what, a few hours, six hours and 20 hours?
Yeah.
So you're not, it's not quite the level of insanity.
And I can say as someone with nearly 60 that like the insanity is there.
10:22
I've shared the screenshots of me just standing in a field of ring blades.
Just do it.
Like it's just, it gets really insane at some point.
So I'll just, I want to couch everything in that and that's framing here because I think there's a difference.
I don't.
I'm not going to.
10:38
Disagree with you but I on the the final end statement I will say that you can get to the the state of I cannot see the enemies because my screen is so filled with rainbows in vampire survivors way way faster.
10:54
Like I will say the run that I've died in just before we started podcasting was one of the, the first ones that I got on with like all the agony stuff and locked and like way more things and like a lot more XP coming in.
And that was the most fun I've had playing this game because it was like the most like playing vampire survivors.
11:16
And I say that in in both a good and bad way.
Like I think the the build up just takes a lot longer to get there, both in terms of like physically for your character in each specific run and in terms of like the meta progression of the game.
All right, well, we've established that they're, they're almost the same in terms of the craziness, but but in what case were they different?
11:39
I, I want to highlight, of course, the controls.
There's there's a subtle difference, which is is totally optional, that in addition to moving around your character, you can aim with what you can.
You can rotate and look in a particular direction, which is appreciated.
11:56
Oh.
Right, you can't aim as if ever as Friars, can you?
Yeah.
Now there are there are effects that will go in the direction that you are looking or that you're moving, I should say and you're but.
But it's it's not like explicitly a twin stick shooter control scheme.
Correct, correct.
But again, this is an optional thing and at certain levels, I imagine it's irrelevant, like which way you're facing or much less relevant.
12:20
But that that was when I first heard about this game was kind of the key thing.
What?
Well, one of two key things, one, that it looked like Diablo 1 slash Diablo 2.
And then the second thing that, oh, you can kind of direct where your attacks are going.
And I think that that is pretty good.
12:38
But I think it's equally good that you can just shut it off and there's an option just to right.
Click, I think to turn it on and off.
And I, I was for the most part, I had that off the entire time because it turns out that actually aiming is like, not fun, but with one character and 1 character only.
12:58
Is that like a a good idea?
And that was the who's the person with the, the rifle?
The, the, the, the Landschnikt.
Yeah.
I don't know how to say that word.
Landschkink.
Yeah, exactly.
Like land night.
It's land night in German or something, right?
As soon as I'm able to like.
13:14
Aim across the map and just shoot like the big elite and aim directly at that elite.
That's a huge advantage because you can just wipe them out before they're a threat.
And yeah, that everything every other class.
Well, I mean, like sometimes like the the one anything that shoots really far, like the with the spear throwing a person, the huntress, like, yeah, it's it's more relevant, but anything that's close range, No, no, absolutely not.
13:37
There's no reason to.
Aim well, they're they're in the last one that I just did with the pyromaniac man in the the halls of dissonance.
I was like baiting big waves of guys to like come around like like corners.
And then I was just like, OK, I'm just going to aim the flamethrower at like the line of dudes.
13:56
And that worked really well.
Like that.
That gave me an option to engage with that twin stick shooting mechanism as well as to like autopilot and be like, all right, well, I'm not going to aim.
I'm just going to like, dance in between the hordes to get to something.
So I never played.
With autobikens it's more relevant.
14:12
I I never played with auto aim.
I like I never even turn it on.
How does it work?
Like is it just aim at thing that's closest to you?
Yeah.
But but per boss fights, Andrew, to your point like that mechanic of just aiming at whatever is closest to you.
Well, the boss is the and in the very end of the game unless.
You're that's a good point.
14:28
Like there's only one boss and so like even with that land night, whatever character, like you just turn auto aim on and they just fucking laser fire the boss 100% of the time.
And it's it's really effective.
Good point.
All right, well, I guess maybe this is the equivalent of like the annoying younger cousin being held the the second player controller that's not actually plugged into anything.
14:50
Me being able to look around and aim makes me feel more engaged, but when I want to, you know, pet my cat or eat a sandwich, I can switch it off.
All right, so here, here's a question in Vampire Survivors, can you tell me what the difference is between the character PO and the character Cavallo?
15:12
Yeah, what does PO smell of garlic, man?
Garlic, man.
Yeah.
And the other one I had no fucking idea.
Nobody.
Knows the dog, the farts, rainbows.
So that we wouldn't know.
Cavallo's Wait, is Cavallo the knife guy?
Cavallo I think what was this picture?
Kind of looks like a panda bear axe man.
15:29
Oh.
Panda bear man.
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
So that's that's a panda bear, man.
What, like confetti?
Starts with cherry bomb.
OK.
Yeah, that was a realistic ability if I recall versus PO garlic excellent or really, I mean not best, but like good early game for sure.
15:48
S tier.
But I think that's like kind of a a key difference between like Arca or Gennaro as your starting characters and Vampire Survivors where it yeah, I mean, like you're just you're clicking them based on like the starting weapon.
But like here, I feel like the the classes very much like Diablo, are maybe a little more kind of upfront intelligible as the difference between a swordsman and an Archer as to like what you're kind of getting yourself in for.
16:19
Well, and they actually like upgrade as as the level they upgrade different stats for different characters, so and they've give to different upgrade trees.
So I think there is actually some pretty big differences between how the characters play.
Yeah.
And I would argue that the, you know, more production value has been put into the visuals.
16:40
There's more sprites.
Wait a minute more.
Animation.
Opening up the treasure.
Yeah, what a shame.
And then every once in a while we'll get the the five beams.
Oh my God.
Well, I will.
16:56
Actually say that, I think that that is something that this game does lack a little bit.
They they also tournament could use like this chest.
Maybe it's a little bit gambling in there.
Well, it did.
Not land the schnick on this particular part of the game.
17:12
When the when the it's.
Missing box not so good.
It's missing the one crucial element of that dopamine injection right into your like the lizard part of your brain, which is the item dropping sound from Diablo.
Oh yeah, Ding, like, oh, that that would like if that if that sounded every time when you get like a big yellow scroll or something like Oh yeah, that would be.
17:36
And gem slots.
They should have gem slots.
Well, not to get ahead of myself towards the end here, but like that's that's one of the things that like excites me the most about this game is like what they're gonna do next with this kind of system.
17:51
Maybe like, you know, they like the the developers here chasing carrots could probably just be like, you know what, we did this, we're done with this.
That's fine.
But like, if this is like the Diablo one version of this, then if they're cooking up like a Diablo 2 version of this, Oh boy, like I would be strapped in for that day one.
18:12
But yeah, like there's there's there's a lot of survivor likes on Steam.
There's at least 500 plus games titled Something Survivors.
On.
Steam Yeah, our our very favorite Rotato game that we all loved.
18:29
Be sure to.
Guest love it.
We we previous episode Hollow Cure also a very a very different tone and aesthetic to vampires and this Yeah, you were not.
Oh, right, that was that anime stupid looking.
18:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But there is, yeah, there's like, you know, a bottomless pit of survivor like games.
But I feel like this one, yeah, it is of the same formula, but it feels like, I don't know, different enough to be, I don't know, like just something like better than a lot of the stuff that just kind of feels like shovelware that you see in in Steam for this kind of category, but.
19:12
I think the category suffers from the fact that you can make a game that's kind of like it fairly easily.
Yeah, but it actually does take work to have it be good like you can.
You can get a minimum viable product very fast, very easy.
It's like.
19:28
I demand better than MVP.
Yeah, it's like when people are like, well, why is Vampire Survivor successful?
I guess because pretty colors and it makes the like the chest opening Jingle.
So I'll just put that in my game and get $10 million also.
But you.
Guys are missing like the one of the big differences there too, which which is like what makes Vampire Survivors different, I think than pretty much anything that we've talked about so far, which is the these synergies between like items.
19:52
You don't know when you combine the acts with the whatever it was, because I can't recall, like it becomes this brand new wonderful thing that does like way more damage or it does something incredible with with this game with all the other ones.
Basically they're they're the upgrades just feel like, oh, I am 1% better at this.
20:08
I am or you know, here's 5% more tax speed, here's 5% more area like, but it's not like, oh, I found this thing and now suddenly I've combined them into the synergistic thing.
Like that's the big mist.
Like that was one of the cool things like you don't know what combines with other things.
There's no guide to it in the game.
20:24
And you're just like picking up this, picking up that and maybe you'll find the thing that integrates them.
And that was just like a a really cool thing that I think that this game doesn't have, but that probably could have benefited it.
Well.
Synergies strike again, very important almost it's it's not a hard and fast rule, but I mean if you have synergies in your game.
20:45
Will likes.
It it's almost always going to be good.
But yeah, when when the Halls of Torment 2 comes out and you have to find the the Lord of Destruction and fight off zillions of enemies then.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lord of Distress, Lord of wrecking stuff or the.
21:02
Lord of Dissonance the.
Lord of there was, there was one bit of lore in this game where I was like, yo, some lore about a Lord and I was like, oh, that's kind of weak.
Like it was the Lord of, I don't know, paranoia or something.
It was kind of, it was kind of silly.
The I, I, I appreciate that there's some like, you know, clear nods to Diablo, you know, oh, there's not the skeleton King, it's the skeleton Lord, you know, But there were, there were a few, there were a little kind of a little, a little goofy.
21:32
There's a there's an actual butcher in this game, There's AI believe there's an elite and or a boss that you fight in in one of the stages that is just a straight up butcher character.
Excellent.
Excellent.
But yeah, what I'm trying to to get at is what is the story of this game?
21:51
What is our story so far, Scott?
Well, you know, that is a great question because as I'm frantically scrolling through the wiki looking for stuff having to do with lore things, this game is, is like, just like Diablo, very much set and focused on getting you in straight into the action as possible.
22:13
And you know, you, you booted up your only hero option that you have is the lowly swordsman.
And you you stroll right on up to that giant gate in front of you and you are thrust face forward into your first hall, the haunted caverns, which feels like just straight out of the outlet.
22:35
One of like these really nice looking, gosh, how do you even describe it?
Like 90s dungeon looking, isometric, grim dark fantasy like grimy, like heavily chunky pixelated dungeons that it's just like, Oh yeah, this is this is where like that Diablo 3 and 4 aesthetic should have gone.
23:00
But yeah, like you are, you're just like dumped into the level 1 here.
And then the waves of enemies just start walking at you.
But luckily they the developers had the foresight to give the the melee character range damage for being able to attack stuff at at a distance.
23:18
So your your swordsman wisely swings in a big cone to do damage.
His sword is very long.
Well, that's that's.
Very strong.
Then then that kind of comes into, I think what Will was talking about in terms of the differences here between this Vampire Survivors, where instead of like your bill being dictated by items that you pick up for the most part, which we'll talk about in a minute.
23:42
The skill tree stuff that you spack out in this game can go in some directions like that, or it can go and tow the other directions.
So like as your warrior, your swordsman, your barbarian is levelling up, you'll, you'll be presented with different options to pick from and for what is it?
24:10
These are called traits, I guess for all the specific characters.
And they all have the same kind of three categories.
There's weapon proficiency, proficient stance and dedication.
But this is where they kind of like give you an option at each upgrade stage of like, So what do you, what do you want to do?
24:26
Like do you want to do you want to do this or do you want to do that?
But it doesn't really like lock you in in One Direction.
So it like for example sourceman weapon proficiency, like the first upgrade tier that you can get for that is either coverage which gives you like 10% more area of like swiping cone or you could do power which is 30% more damage.
24:47
So you can pick like I don't wanna do more damage or more range for your first level of upgrade for that, but you can pick again between those two options for the second, third and 4th upgrades.
So you could go all in on range if you really wanted to, or you could go all in on damage, or you could go in a mix of both.
25:07
But the very last one, the the tier 5 upgrade for weapon proficiency almost kind of forces you to make a choice based on your investments, I guess in that for the swordsman, you can pick blunt force, which gives you plus 100 base damage at the cost of -.1 base crit chance for your main weapon, or Wide Swing, which gives you a + 45° base area to your cone but -.2 base attack speed.
25:39
So like there's, there's kind of trade-offs for how you're sort of specking your character out and then you're faced with one big final decision of like, do you want it?
Well, you want to do this or that.
And then like with say proficient stance, for example, same kind of idea.
But like you're in decisions like what do you want to do plus 60 damage and -30 range?
25:57
Or do you want plus 30 range and -60 damage?
And depending on the stuff that like you've built out, you could do like, you know, plus plus damage, plus damage plus damage, and then do the one that does like the -60 damage to balance out with the range.
Or you just say, you know what, fuck the range.
26:13
I'm just going to go with all in on damage and just be the the short sorded king that I am and annihilate anything within arm's reach of me, which I think is.
Sometimes, and sometimes you can't go so all in on one thing that you destroy your build like you can.
26:30
In fact, you know there's a couple of them that they're like, plus this minus this, those minuses can stack up real hard if you don't have something else to to account balance.
If you say like -120% damage, boy, sure, that's not very much anymore.
26:46
But then it's like I'm hitting everything on the map but it's doing no damage.
Yeah, but while depending on which one of those that you pick, you might be getting a an avalanche of these kind of quest progression upgrades that you'll just be like, Oh my God, how many achievements are in this game?
27:08
As it just starts popping off 1 after another after another as you start playing.
And if you're like me, you'll pop up the menu and start digging through this quest log and see a very cute detail for things like the haunted caverns And the the the quest tracker for that is like almost kind of like a little dungeon grid map in the shape of a skull that you can't quite see what the other objectives are.
27:36
Because when you unlock 1, you unlock like, oh, the next objective is like an adjacent tile, like fog of war sort of deal to it, which I thought was was a neat little detail.
And the one for the like you, you have those for the various levels and then you scroll over to the one for the swordsman and like the the little tiles for the quest things are like drawn out in a little pixel sword shape.
28:00
Yeah, I'm like, you know, they didn't need to do that, but I'm glad that they did because it just, it feels feels very appropriate.
But so, you know, if you're stacking range, you might get that swordsman quest of, oh, killed 600 monsters that are over or what was that?
28:20
I think it was one of them that killed like, you know, do damage to like 75 or 100 monsters at a time.
And you're like, how on earth would I do that?
But if you're swinging like a cone the size of like the screen towards the end of the level, pretty easy to do and you'll you'll check mark that off.
28:38
And you'll find and you can find some item that gives you like crazy extra range or like there's, there's other stuff too where it's like, OK, you stack this on top of this other thing and on top of this other thing.
And suddenly like this is starting to become more than the sum of its parts.
I found that like with crit builds especially, that is the case where it's like you either go all in on it or not at all.
29:02
And eventually, just like aha, now they're creating every single time, sometimes more than once per hit, and that gets pretty fun.
Well, this is also something interesting that I didn't know to check until I saw someone's YouTube video for it, which I was like, what it what the hell does force do?
29:22
It's like, yeah, you, I mean, you have some, some pickups that are just like, you know, do you do you want more damage?
Do you want more crit?
Do you want channeling?
Do you want metabolism?
Do you want regeneration?
And you're just like, I don't know, maybe.
29:37
And some of them have like a little like upward arrow next to them.
Some of them have two upward arrows, some of them have a diagonal arrow.
And some of them you're just like, I don't know what the hell this thing does or why it's useful.
But opening up your little character panel in the main menu next to like, let's say the the, the Archer, for example, you'll have some ability, it says like launch velocity and in parentheses it'll say range or Max duration, parentheses force, size, parentheses area or piercing parentheses force again, you're like, oh, that's, that's a lot of force things.
30:12
Maybe I should get some force stuff for the Archer instead of just damn.
It what those arrows are.
The but what do you mean?
What are what are those little arrows that are besides like like sometimes it would be like dedication and it has like an upward side arrow.
30:27
Is that what?
What does that mean?
Those if will doesn't correct me before I can find it those.
I thought this whole story was leading up to you telling us what those meant.
Oh, well, like, well, there's there's kind of two aspects to it.
One of them is like if it's like a plot, like just a straight up arrow, it will give you like a little extra additive bonus to it.
30:45
If it's a double up arrow, it's like even better.
So let's say like like you're picking vitality.
It's like, oh, this gives me like plus plus like 30 health or something like a one up arrow and like these will vary depending on the characters, but like one up arrow would be like it would be plus 40 health or two up arrows would be plus fifty base health and I guess like the so.
31:08
It's like this is better than the normal one.
Yeah, because it's your character.
Yeah, like it's just some characters are just more specialized towards certain things and you'll find the warrior is more specialized towards more HP or the cleric, you know, with HP regeneration and so, or the Archer with speed or critical.
31:25
I forgot to, but that's, that's generally how it works is each character will have a added benefit for a specific thing.
So if you have a sage, which is like one of the slowest characters and you you realize you want more speed, well, that .2 or that with a 2% increase in in speed is or no, wait, wait, wait, it's 20.
31:43
I can't recall it's. .2 meters per second.
Yeah, .2 meters, yeah, like that is like much less than the like I think it's like .4 or .5 for the Archer, but like you still need speed, so you sometimes just like all right, I'll take it, even though it's a way shittier.
Well, also crucially, the the one that one I think you're describing is like a global speed like movement speed modifier.
32:03
And there might be abilities that you pick up that are impacted by that or you might have like Archer specific traits that you are offered.
That's like, well, like if you pick this one here, that's going to give the Archer character specifically like plus like. 50.
32:18
Move speed or something, You're like, well that's much bigger than the other one.
Maybe I should pick that, but like those other things.
So those other options might apply to like other abilities and stuff.
So it's it's like, do I want to invest more in like this, like the player character specifically or do I want to invest in the things that might affect like some OP ability synergies that I got going on kind of a deal?
32:43
Right.
Or all of the ability traits that you can get, which are usually like much more powerful, but they apply only to the specific ability.
It's like you could get the one that's like plus six attack speed for every or 6% attack speed for everything, or plus like 20% attack speed but only for your golem who punches stuff and then rolls around every once in a while.
33:09
But yeah, so as you are progressing through the haunted caverns and killing waves after waves of skeletons, toxic slimes, skeleton mages, teleport mages, Imps, hell hounds and so forth.
33:25
Little hell hounds.
You will be offered some elites who will like fly onto the screen and you'll see like like purple effects and like little AOE things to dodge.
And they have health bars, so you know, it's serious.
33:42
Yeah, yeah, you're not going to be rolling over 60 of them at a time.
Kind of a deal, but it looks like what like every like 8-8 minutes or so, like 6 or 8 minutes, you get a boss that comes in and it'll be like the imp Chieftain or the skeleton Lord who who come in and it's like, you know, just it's an elite fight but with some more danger to it.
34:07
And typically when you defeat them, they'll drop one of these ability scrolls that will give you an ability, which we'll talk about in a second, or an item, which I think this is an interesting mechanic here with the item stuff that, like you, you have some equipment slots that you can kind of start out with.
34:28
But in order to get more items, you are limited to sending one of them back to town up through the well.
That's on each one of these levels that you start next to that gives you I guess technically the ability to purchase it on one of your next runs.
34:47
So in theory, like if you're like, well, damn, I don't, I don't have 30 minutes to waste here.
You could just go and fight the first boss, see if they drop an item that you have not picked up yet, run it back to the well, send it up and you're like, all right, now I can go do my taxes or you know what have you.
And then you can play with that item the next time.
35:05
So you're not explicitly.
And you permanently have that item once you send up the well and you pay the one time gold cost.
Hello, thank you for buying my.
He should be paying us for these items.
I'm, I'm taking, I'm guessing that you guys have not completed, none of you have gone to the vault, so you don't know what happens with the guy who sells you the things.
35:27
I do because I write it on the wiki.
Well, that's a nice teaser.
I better.
Keep Yeah, well, I guess we always spoil these things.
But I guess Andrew, if you're planning on, I always spoil it for you, but.
Well, I'll think about it.
35:43
For the for the deep lower, that is Hall's deployment.
Indeed, which regarding the lore, I mean there there is as you start, you know, meeting the different NPC's and you start sending NPC's back to town.
There is some lore to be had and it does involve some some greedy spellcasters you know going down into the depths of the halls looking for untold when.
36:09
You say there's some lore, some is doing some pretty heavy lifting there.
There's there's.
Lore miniscule shavings of lore, but if you.
Compare that to the rest of the genre, the rest of the subgenre.
I feel like there's a there's a lot more happening here and I think there's.
36:26
It is a shot more lore than Vampire Survivors, which is.
Well, I.
Don't know, I mean, I think I think it has maybe like 60% as much lower as Diablo one because, and I say that because like so so you know, you fight your first boss of of the haunted caverns.
36:48
You you kill him and you're like, Hooray, I've done the thing.
And that unlocks the next level, the ember grounds, a lot more fire enemies here and some some interesting kind of like gimmicks and and stuff going on.
37:03
So notably on this stage, this is 1 where that that you can rescue the well keeper, who so this is contingent on like, all right, you got to you got to beat that first stage.
You get here, you rescue the well keeper, then you can start sending the items.
Yeah, you could rescue the well Keeper and all five of his animation frames.
37:21
I love how chunky low frame rate the speaking portraits are for the NPCS.
It is perfect.
If you've ever played like Fallout 1 where only the important NPCS get little speaking portraits, it's great.
37:40
Love it.
Perfect.
No notes it.
Reminds me of like N64 like talking portraits.
Yeah, or, or even just like the little portraits you see in like StarCraft or.
Something.
No.
No.
No, no, even.
It's not even as good as that.
Even close, if it was, if it was the the, yeah, you take the StarCraft portrait and you reduce it to like two or three FPS or something like it's, it's much, much chunkier on purpose, of course.
38:09
Well as you as you rescue the the well keeper and you buy more and more items from him, another neat little detail is that he will start to become like more and more like decked out in like expensive looking clothes and gear I.
38:24
Didn't notice that.
Either Oh yeah, yeah, it's pretty funny.
He'll he'll get like a little gold crown and then some like gold, gold rimmed glasses and then finally some like pompous looking big silly hat kind of a deal.
But yeah, there's, there's like dialogue about, you know, you, you go and talk to him and you know, he'll talk about like some of the other NPCS that, that you rescue, like the, the cup bearer or the script tour, who you rescue on, on subsequent level.
38:58
So like the forgotten viaduct, the big long bridge with haunted souls that it is, it is bridging over.
That's where you you rescue the the potion man, the the cup barrier and the frozen depths is where you rescue the script tour, notably by going in like setting fire to so he needs some sort of like fire damage ability to break him out of his little ice prison.
39:27
But bring it out like this another kind of like progression system of the game where like the cut bearer will allow you to to have this amulet that you can equip that will sort of like very like nebulously point in radar directions.
39:46
Like there's like an ingredient over here for you to go to pick and there's one over here for you to go pick and you pick up these ingredients to get like you're you're basically like your reroll and banish options for your different abilities and stuff.
I feel like this kind of comes a little late, but maybe provides some good replayability of like.
40:07
You know, going back to different stages because what's it you got 123, you got like 5 different of these potions here that some of them, well, there's like two ingredients on each stage and then one on each agony version of each stage.
40:23
So it does give you some incentive to like all right, I'm going to go back there.
I'm going to go get the thing.
Got the thing.
All right, I'm done here.
Quit out great 5 minutes.
Didn't didn't need to run the whole thing unless you have a good build going.
But these will give you re rolls your banishes, your save this one for next time option and I forget what the other ones do, but those those kinds of deals.
40:46
The scriptor who is your hooded figure who comes to comes to town is kind of almost like your in game encyclopedia of the items that you've picked up, but also allows you to apply permanent meta progression upgrades to the individual characters once you've defeated the various hall bosses.
41:10
Yeah, imagine if Brave Adventurer gets to the bottom of the Tristram dungeon and slays Diablo.
And the soulstone for once was actually a good thing.
Yeah, the bosses in this game drop these shards, and the shards can then be used to permanently empower one of your characters.
41:31
So.
You meaningfully empower too.
I have been hoarding. 5% increase in one stat.
Hey, that's one character.
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Is that is that like .5% per level or just point?
41:47
5% per stone, per stat, per character.
So once you get the upgrade to fight 3 bosses at the end, the bosses drop 2 shards each and then suddenly you have like 75100 of these shards and you can like increase your attack speed out of the gate by 25% or yeah.
42:06
So it's like it's.
Significant.
I'll say that for the 1st 15 hours of the game, it does not.
Oh absolutely, yeah, it's a complete dog shit for the like for most of the game, yeah.
Like I feel like this guy honestly shouldn't exist until after you start getting those upgrades.
42:23
Like it, it feels like it's, oh, here's some mechanic that feels so underwhelming because this metacurrency is so paltry at first.
Like you're telling me now.
Like I feel like 15 hours is a pretty long time to have played a game in general.
42:43
Well, you you would be missing.
But I guess not.
You'd be missing out on the Script Tour's highly important dialogue about the well Keeper where he says I know many stories about men relentlessly chasing riches as if their path to wealth was a divine prophecy.
43:00
Not a single one of those stories ends well.
I fear for his soul.
And you'll have to imagine that like each, each word that I'm speaking is like 1-1 different animation frame.
But I fear for the well-being of those around him even more.
So there's like.
43:15
Yes, ends the lore of this game.
Hey, you know.
What for?
For a a a $6.66 indie game, which devil again?
You know, top tier meme pricing, I got to say.
Wait hold on though, I want to go back to story you guys were.
43:33
When I said that this game has more story than Vampire Survivor, you guys kind of shouted me down.
What story is there in Vampire Survivors?
I mean, I think at this point with like how?
Like, I think the fact that it has even like a couple of voiced lines already means that it wins.
Colin, have you played the Contra DLC for Vampire Survivors?
43:52
Very important.
Yeah, I don't know what they're talking about either.
I kind of nodded like I knew.
I mean.
Is vaguely Italian.
The the the lore behind the Eudaimonia machine like where do we even start?
I mean like the vampire survivors itself is just like collapsed in on itself into the singularity of like what is even happening in this anymore if you.
44:15
Pause any image of this thing on the screen and you count out where all the enemies are in the screen.
It actually does spell out in Morse code a deep and enriching story about Italian vampires Still.
Remember there are missions and I don't remember this, the specifics at this point.
44:33
It's been what, a year happy.
I don't know how long since we played it, but like I remember there's there's one point where you're the garlic man Pope, right?
And you're, you're like running through like it was like a special level and like there's things chasing and there's like, and I don't remember the lower round, but there, there was some reason why you wanted to do that.
44:50
And there was like some story around that.
There's so a bird that if you unlock it, the bird was significant in some way.
And like the different levels have different like stories around them.
So like I.
Really it really it really both of these games stretch the definition of what lore is.
45:07
There's like war versus setting.
I just.
Appreciate the story.
Sure, sure.
But I appreciate that there is some obvious context for like, what I'm doing and each run the game, whether it be through the quests or through, you know, tracking down ingredients, it gives me a reason to be doing a run.
45:34
I think, yeah, I think this game does a lot better job of like giving you a reason for you, the player, to be doing a specific run.
Indeed, and that and something that I struggled with with Vampire Survivors, like pretty quickly into playing Vampire Survivors, I was Googling like, all right, well, I've unlocked all the levels.
45:51
Like what?
Unless I want to go like achievement hunting, which is not really my style.
Like what do I do?
And and that's what led me to doing some of the weird wacky stuff like you were describing Will, with running down a hallway and things flying around and birds indeed.
46:11
I don't know what it is about Quest, but Quest makes me want to do it so much more than achievement.
Totally, totally.
Like something about the way that this is in it's integrated into the game makes it feel more impactful than just like achievements.
46:27
Yeah, like if you had, if you had told me that like, oh, in order to to unlock the exterminator, the class for this game, I would have to go and kill 1000 enemies in the Ember Grounds.
Like if you just told me that, I would just be like, Nah, this sounds super boring.
46:43
But if you told me like, oh, if you play the Ember Grounds for like 10 minutes, you will happen to kill 1000 enemies and then like, boom, your next character is unlocked.
Like, OK, sign me up.
I feel like when I was first playing this game, the the little quest thing that popped up at the top and when you check the quest journal was very much like unlocked driven.
47:05
At first.
It was like, go and defeat this character or go like beat, beat the boss for this level, survive for this long.
Do the like, do this thing.
I'm like, OK, yeah, I'm very motivated to go and do that thing.
And then at some point, like I don't know what happened, but like it flipped to to like, yeah, doing like do kill 50,000 Imps or something.
47:27
I'm like, yeah, but I don't know, like do I like what does that?
What does that do for me?
O2000 gold?
Like I want to like unlock the stuff.
Give me give me more thingies to play with.
There are two categories of unlocks that I mean, like, I don't know if you moused over every single unlock possible like I have, but like they're either gold or there is some, some actual tangible thing which might be like, oh, in in the upgrade path for this character, you will unlock this category of things because otherwise previously you'd be capped at like, you know, only proficiency for, for whatever the bullshit is, right.
48:02
And so it seems like like that stuff isn't, I don't know, it seems important.
Yeah, I mean, like purchase an item from the Well Keeper and that gives you like that unlocks another item for spellcaster gloves, like defeat the worm queen, unlocks the warlock.
48:18
I'm like, OK, yeah, tangible, focusable things.
I sort of wish that like the the quest like mini map thing that you have for either the characters or the halls was maybe a little bit more explicit with that of like, all right, go and do this.
48:37
Like, I don't know what, what's the phraseology for like this tangible action to do this thing versus like this passive stuff?
I know.
That there's a milestone or something?
Yeah, lifetime achievement is 1 category versus like within a run do a thing.
48:54
And that's, and I know this because that's what I'm looking at right now for my own game.
But like, yeah, that's a very, that's the very specific.
Like difference.
And yeah, I think like generally it does those very well because it it it guideposts me to be like, OK on on this new map that I unlocked.
49:10
Great.
What's this thing that I can go and do to have more, more toys to play with?
And yeah, so like with, you know, we talked about for each of the stages unlocking at the different camp NPCS, but you'll unlock different characters along the way as well.
49:28
Like we could kind of talked about just a minute ago, the Exterminator, the the.
Warlock.
You got your Cleric, the Shield Maiden, the Norseman, the Sage, the our favorite lands necked, the Beast Huntress, and the Sorceress.
49:44
It needs to be landschneaked.
Landschneck is definitely land snail.
Based on my movement speed in that one run, that would, that would apply pretty well.
But but all these characters, I, I like how different all these characters are from each other.
50:01
I think they all have different, different uses.
And some of them also like we talked a little bit about like, oh, like as you're progressing your build, you can like pick more damage or more range or do this thing or that thing.
Some of them also have like different weapons specifically that you can kind of push upgrade directions onto.
50:23
So if the the land knight, I guess will translate has has two weapons.
She has like the Super powered rifle and but she also has like AOE grenades that she throws and you'll do like 11 attack with one and then the other attack with the other one.
50:39
And like Will was pointing out, like I was stuck on the Forgotten Viaduct for a while because the the Hydra boss was just destroying me.
I'm like, well, you know who could do some big damage from big range?
The land snail.
50:57
Landscape and like all good land snails, you have a an arcabus blunderbus type type rifle or you have grenades that you can spec into.
And so I was like, well, I'm just going to dump all of my stats and stuff into this super powered rifle.
51:13
And then for the abilities, use those as like the AOE backup stuff to just take out all the mobs that Hydra didn't know what hit him.
It was just sniped from across the map.
And I'm absolutely, yeah, that that great.
Feeling like right?
3 heads like you just go bazinga bazinga bazinga.
51:30
I mean that that's the that rare circumstance where you're actually aiming and you're just like standing really far away.
You're looking at that thing in the distance and then you're just like absolutely murdering it.
And it's just, it's very satisfying.
But so, yeah, so, so some of the the characters will have, you know, like the swordsman just has a sword, Archer just has the arrows, Exterminator just has the the flamethrower.
51:54
But you know, beast huntress has a spear and a doggie shield Maiden has has a a whomping attack, but also a shield bash attack.
And one of the quests for that was like, do some number of damage with just the shield.
And like, then it became kind of a puzzle of like, well, how do I do that?
52:11
And then it, it sort of unraveled itself to me.
I'm like, OK, this is, I can see where the systems are coming from here.
This is, it's a very different feel than vampire survivors where, you know, you're like, I'm going to level up the, the garlic to maximum level and then I'm going to get the, the clock stopping thing to maximum level and then see what wild synergies pop out of that.
52:34
It this, it feels very more I don't know role-playing tech tree system here, RPG tech tree system, but it.
Does feel it feels more like playing Diablo, yeah.
Like it feels like you are playing as a character running around in a fantasy world, doing, doing fantasy things.
52:55
Like there's a lot more enemies than a Diablo, but not that many more sometimes.
But the abilities that you can pick up range everything from phantom needles to frost Avalanche to ring blades, Meteor Strike, the Kugelblitz, you got your your spectral fists, prismatic cascade, the clay Golem, all sorts of fun stuff that you know, like for all intents and purposes are very kind of similar to the the pickups that you get in Vampire Survivors.
53:27
Indeed.
But, but like work pretty well.
And I'm, I'm curious to get the rest of the the crew's opinion here, Like how much did the items that you wound up unlocking dictate the kind of play style that you wound up doing?
53:47
And I'll start with my example of like, well, I got some, some items pretty early on that were very much scaled off of burn.
And so I, I picked the fire bat, I hit that stem pack and I'm like, all right, it's, it's time for some propane PAIN.
54:03
And I was stacking up on flame strike, stacked up on Dragon's breath, anything that did fire damage on top of that.
And I, so I had like boots that left fire on the ground.
I had a crown that did like for every enemy that's on fire, you gain plus stuff like, let's, let's do it, let's burn.
54:22
And it was great.
Like the whole screen was on fire and oh, and then I had another item that was like transforms your your main item to fire damage.
And I was like, all right, well, we got to test this out on the Archer, switch to Archer with like maximum attack speed and kind of just apply to the same formula of like do do massive fire damage now that everything is on fire from the main effect thing.
54:46
But I'm curious from other people's perspective, like, did did like the items that you unlock like dictate that kind of play style for you?
Or is it more sort of ability driven?
100% item driven.
I mean, once, once you have that, like you, you'll do a run, you send up one item and later you just set up two or three.
55:04
Once you have some unlocks, but like you send up one item, suddenly you have a new item.
You want to use that new item, then your next builds.
Sort of like your next playthrough.
All right, yeah, let's see how you can use it.
Yeah, you want to use that and like and then eventually like and and you use it to its fullest extent and like.
There's a lot of achievements that are based on on using things to it, Like like no matter what new thing you just got, if you use it to its fullest extents, you can like get some other unlock.
55:29
And so to use it right away is to basically allow yourself to have the maximum opportunity for whatever unlock is related to that new thing you unlocked.
And so, I don't know, it just made sense early on in the game to always use the new thing you unlocked.
55:45
Yeah, I mean, I feel like the quit rings are pretty good that that makes it fun.
Like all right, I'm going to do a crazy crit build.
Well, you start with those though, right?
Like the one that's like plus crit probability and then plus crit damage.
Like those are two rings that you start with, right?
56:04
May may have misremember.
I remember there's like the things you start with are like the glue elements, if I recall, like they're good across all the builds.
And so more crit damage plus higher probability per crit are like glue sort of things.
Whereas fire damage things like Scott was mentioning that's a very much a, a specialized sort of thing or like.
56:23
The coat that is.
If you have slow or fragile or whatever applied, apply that to other things nearby.
That is that That coat is extremely useless unless you are building your build around that.
56:40
You're like, all right, I must.
If I'm, if I'm going down wearing this crazy coat, I must do, I must get the weird needle thing spikes that inflict that.
Otherwise this is an entirely wasted slot.
56:56
Scott, I had a similar loot experience to you where I got some of the fire items and so I was playing as the exterminator fire bat class.
Although before that the game kept dropping for me like summons items, which I don't know, I just I really was not interested in those and so I just ignored them.
57:18
But furthermore, the the this whole item system I really appreciate because again, it it gives you a tangible and important goal other than just, you know, inflicting maximum damage and killing enemies.
So instead of just wandering aimlessly through the level, you, you know, find a good piece of loot.
57:38
And then it's like, all right, now it is my mission to get it back to Lowell and secure this item for my my future runs, which, yeah, I think is, you know, great, great design.
It's good.
It's good stuff.
And I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to talk about how great of a pyromania experience the the exterminator class is.
58:05
This, this fella that or or this this this Envy are probably is dressed up in a wonderful Plague Dr. mask and a full head to toe dope ass outfit, a nifty little hat and a wonderful vaguely steampunk kind of bronze flamethrower device.
58:28
And these effects are just perfect from that that late 90s pre rendered flame experience.
And you couple that all together with the active abilities that you can get that are also fire themed.
The Dragon's Breath and some other one.
58:45
I forget what it is and it is just a delight to be just torching all of these of these beasts.
Very cathartic.
Whereas, you know, I've, I've been so accustomed a lot of my gaming life having to hack apart demons and skeletons with swords, with bows, with magic.
59:04
But now I have the opportunity to take a flamethrower to them, which I just love.
It's great.
We're just like a straight up gun or.
Just a straight up gun.
Yeah, just in general, I think that the all the individual classes are are really like well done from from a presentation standpoint and just, you know, how they they feel and look.
59:29
And that is a lot better than, oh, I don't know, a potato.
But is it better than a dog that barks rainbow firecrackers just barely?
One character and nobody plays that one.
59:48
How much did did people engage with like the individual hall?
Well, I guess we'll call them.
Well, they're listed in the wiki as secrets.
I guess I would say like features maybe like gameplay features of each of the halls maybe.
1:00:04
I don't know how much like of a do or die this is on higher agony levels.
But but yeah, will will.
Do you have a any opinions?
On the 100%, every, every single map, at a certain point, you know what you need to do.
1:00:20
Like in the beginning it's like this mystery of like, oh, there's this weird thing.
It's going to have like a bunch of really slow text to tell you some lore and it's a bunch of bullet.
I don't read anything.
And then you're like, oh, OK, well, there's some blood that runs off in this direction and you just, you trace the blood.
Spoilers.
1:00:36
Yeah, it's it's it's great.
I.
Just I'm kidding.
And that's fun.
So you, you, you see, you do that objective for that one side, then you run back and then you run down the other side of the blood trail and they're like, oh, now suddenly I've got this beating or this heart of whatever the fuck it was.
And, and it makes the boss easier.
1:00:54
And it's just like, well, if you can make the boss easier by just doing.
Hammering Hammer, the Heart of Lurkin and damaged Dagathur.
Yeah, it's like, what else are you going to do?
Like you're.
You said it.
That's The thing is like you have objectives like as a character in this map, you have places to be like otherwise you just stand in one position and you would absorb all the experience and it's most it would be extremely effective because none of the experience would be evading you.
1:01:18
Whereas this game and all these vampire like games are Vampire Survivors like games.
You have to go someplace and do something, and they want to give you objectives around the map of places to go.
And this stuff gives you something to do, which also benefits like the end game.
And so no matter what level you are, if you can complete the stupid little objective that the map has, you know, oh, follow this stupid crow until it like, finds its thing and then, yeah, whatever.
1:01:43
I'll just, you know, I'll do that.
And then suddenly makes the end easier.
It's something to do, you know?
Otherwise you're just like, you know, I'm just sitting in one position doing nothing.
I will say it's.
Something to do.
But to answer your question, Scott, I engaged with it so far as I, I tried to follow the crows several times and I failed.
1:02:00
And then I, the secret objective in the, in the frost caves led me to a fight I was not prepared for.
That's unfortunate.
But yeah, it's fun environmental storytelling, dare I say it, with, you know, somewhat limited tools given the presentation of the game.
1:02:18
But as you say, Will, it's great because then you've you've got something to do and you're not just staying, staying put.
Colin, did you ever enable the OR activate the dissinator monolith?
No, I I could not figure out how to do it and then I forgot.
1:02:36
I don't know what it is.
I think you mean the.
Dissinator.
I only played that level twice so.
Well that makes sense then.
It took me like a few times before I understood that you just like the ones that you that are around that you don't have a laser pointed at them do nothing.
But as soon as you find the one that has a laser pointed at it, you just point the laser at where the arrow is, and they all have arrows and so they.
1:02:56
Point the laser at where the arrows, yes.
So.
So there's.
The thing and that thing deflects it in a different direction and there's an arrow right next to that thing and if you just tap it, it's like changes clockwise it's.
Oriented.
Oh, OK.
I guess I never real.
I didn't I didn't see the tap.
1:03:12
By the time I got to there, I was already like, I feel like these objectives, you kind of have to do them earlier in your run while you can still see what's happening on the screen.
But like there's 100% like I, I, it might take a while and then like, but eventually there is a lot of chaos happening on the screen and it does become difficult to do like the quests, like I can't follow the blood trail anymore because I can't see the ground.
1:03:44
That was the problem.
That is a problem.
Yeah, the the dissimilator monolith was like, I think I must have walked past it 10 times while trying to beat the the chambers of dissonance the first time.
And I was just getting rocked every time until like I looked at the little quest long and it's like, oh, there's like this thing called a dissimilator model, like great name number one that does like massive damage, like maybe this will help.
1:04:09
And so I'm well, like it.
Almost no damage actually in the end game.
It must have been some some sort of psychological boost then, because this was this was me like running my fire bat around in circles, like around the destinator monolith, like having that like ZAP enemies while I'm doing it was probably like the giant AOE flame damage that was actually doing the the real bulk of the work here.
1:04:32
But whenever, like an the an elite or like the final boss would spawn, like having that thing just like Bam, like ZAP them down to nothing, like Ha ha, I've gotten my revenge finally on this on this stupid level.
But that felt pretty good.
Like that.
That or the the ember grounds where you're going and finding like a the the cracked ember eye to get an elite fight.
1:04:55
And then you get some Mac guffin from there or the forgotten viaduct that makes the the end boss for that stage not have an invincibility stage kind of stuff.
So there's, there's like little things to do for each of these stages that are are.
You're quite welcome.
1:05:12
And it sounds like the I'm guessing these scale for like having to fight 3 bosses at once as well.
They're inconsequential, to be honest, but like you, you, you just kind of do them because there's nothing else to do when you're at the highest level.
You're like, oh, well, I found, you know, I found the thing, so sure, I'll do it.
But it wouldn't wouldn't you could just stand in one blaze to have all your ring blades kill everything on screen.
1:05:31
It's it's really not important.
So yeah, there has to be that, that kind of meaty zone where like the difficulty and your ability or your character's ability is in that perfect sync, then it's it's great.
But like once you have too much of an ability, it doesn't matter.
1:05:49
Will give us give us your cracked build recipe for the good listeners.
Yeah, well, I mean, for all the maps, there's a one or at least I think for all the maps there's one unlock which is like deal 500 million damage.
1:06:05
And that's in the game.
It seems like a lot really early on we're doing, you know, less than 100 damage per hit And and eventually, yeah.
So the, the, the Sage is one of the characters that they don't have a, an ability, like they don't have like a sword hit or anything.
1:06:20
They just use like all the, the extra abilities and they're, they're the first one you pick is their main ability and they get extra stats for that.
And so there's this thing I noticed ring blades and every one of my runs where I picked that one, it seemed to have more DPS.
And so I'm like, well, let's just push everything into that.
1:06:38
And turns out that that is an auto win for every single context.
And so if you choose a sage and you're able to survive the early game where your speed is super slow and they just run up to you and they just kill you immediately as long as you can get enough speed to escape them for a little while, yeah, you do over.
1:06:59
I mean, as I mentioned before, we got on this over a billion damage in some cases.
And so it's it's an insane amount of damage and you by the end of it, you just you don't even have the the accoutrements for the stand in one place to get bonuses.
You don't need that.
1:07:14
You just stand in one place though, and suddenly everything dies.
Nothing even enters your vision.
And so that's.
You're you're just like a StarCraft carrier surrounded by your spinning.
I thought it.
Was interceptors everywhere?
Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.
Yeah, I did think it was interesting that this game does not calculate damage dealt based off of characters like you're based off of the thing you're hitting.
1:07:38
So like most games, if you hit a thing with 100 health you can't it won't log as having done more than 100 damage.
That is not true for this game.
Oh really?
I'm pretty.
Sure.
I mean, I'm not.
I don't pay attention to that stuff.
You almost positive.
1:07:54
Things and get credit for.
I think you get credit like, yeah, if you hit something that has 100 health with something that does 10,000 damage, I'm pretty sure you get credit for the 10,000 damage because you know, I got the, you know, you get the deal 10,000 damage in one hit achievement.
1:08:13
And I hit like some random MOOC.
I did not hit something.
I had 10,000 hit points.
And you just atomized him.
You turned him into a fine mist.
Yeah, the first time I did it like a successful stage run, I hit like all of the I, I got a a gazillion of those damage related achievements.
1:08:34
And like I don't think that I could physically like I don't think I killed that many more dudes than I did on a previous level.
I can't have done but.
You do if you as soon as you kill someone.
And this is my understanding, I don't actually know this is the case, but my my belief here is that as soon as you kill something and there's like there's supposed to be a certain number of creatures on screen at a point in time, then another one will spawn.
1:08:58
So the faster that you kill them, the faster they spawn.
Yeah, but it'll tell you how many creatures you killed, and I didn't kill that many.
OK, I don't know if that's actually how it works or if there's only a set amount.
This this was the one that I was like ultra crit build and lightning.
1:09:13
So I, I was more limited my, the, the problem I had with this build was less the amount of damage I could output and more the number of distinct times I could output that damage.
Which is like there are, I am doing like 10,000 damage per hit, but each one hit only one specific thing.
1:09:33
And so I'm like, everything I hit dies in one hit, but there's more guys coming in and so I have to like dodge around the ball.
So this is a complaint though because I, and this might be just a user error sort of thing, but because Sage plus ring blades seems like the winner in every circumstance, I'm not really sure.
1:09:56
Like what?
What?
Are there other ones to compete with?
Maybe the maybe if I choose any character they're able to output the same amount of damage but under a different context?
I have not found that to be the case.
And so it basically means that on the landscape of all the different characters and their total DPS output capabilities, given best conditions, it seems like there is a very different level for each of these.
1:10:19
And so like, yeah, your S tier down to your F tier.
I think that's kind of the way this game works.
Just like what other games.
And like at different stages in the game, like that will have a different effect early on versus later when you have all the items and everything.
So it's it's so that's kind of an interesting element, right?
1:10:36
Like overtime, the things that was good might not be so good at the very end.
And so there's like this ever changing environment where you have to make decisions about like what's good for.
Your context and I love what's the what's the maximum torment level that you can play on Torment 5?
1:10:51
And is there like I'm guessing there's some sort of unlock or achievement for beating each stage on Torment 5 of some sort?
I'm not sure.
If that was 1.
Agony 5.
Or agony 5 but like there's is there agony and torment?
1:11:06
I think it's the shrink.
Anything like ascension levels?
Kind of, yeah.
The torment is how many of those items that you have that you start with, which I don't know how.
I think you can have the unlimited.
I know there's there's like 20 or 30 items I think that are in total and you have to get every one of them well.
1:11:23
But like you can use.
Up to 5.
You can use up to 5.
Well, agony.
I don't know what I don't know.
Honestly.
Agony is or what it does.
It like happens over.
Time, yeah, exactly.
But what does it give you?
I have no idea.
But torment is just like the number of like actual like ascension levels and slate aspire because we have to use that term terms.
1:11:42
That's the one that we have to to think about.
Well, the actual end game is governed by you purchasing 30 items from the well keeper, who then mysteriously disappears from the camp and and in his wake is left a little dribbling trail of gold that I believe will correct me if I'm wrong, leads you to the vault.
1:12:12
Which is.
What it does, which is the final stage.
All right, spoiler alerts.
The worst stage, in fact.
Sure, go ahead and spoil it.
What happens?
No, the worst stage is not a spoiler.
Yeah, is a spoiler.
Sorry.
You know what I can't say.
Wait was the worst stage.
The Vault.
1:12:28
What do you not like about it?
It's the, the structure of the map is extremely confined.
And yeah, you can beat the boss in 5 minutes.
And so it's just like all these achievements about being in there for 4550, you know, minutes or whatever.
1:12:47
It's just like, this is just bullshit.
You know, just hey, can you stay in this area and stand like literally, I'll alt tab.
My sage is sitting there in the middle of all these ring blades and I don't have to worry about him at all.
He just, he just kills everything.
And then I wait and then, oh, I'll tap back.
1:13:03
Oh, yeah, 48 minutes have passed.
Great.
And then so it feels like it's a, an afterthought sort of a level, like there's not enough level design here to keep it so that it's, it's interesting.
There's one boss in the middle and that's basically, I think there's, there's four different things that you have to like break down on like the kind of 8:00-ish short of chambers around the middle.
1:13:24
And there's the middle.
And so you just kind of like roam around the outside and then you're like, OK, now I have to sit here for another 40 minutes and then you all tap.
And so that's that was my experience.
But.
Yeah, that's not required, right?
That's like, yeah, it's extra credit, some kind of fancy will level achievement that that I wouldn't dare attempt.
1:13:46
But yeah, that's that.
That's a little disappointing to hear.
There's there's a cool like there is a Diablo esque animation like a a cinematic at the very end.
Oh, really?
Which fun.
Is decent in Diablo terms, and so I'll I mean, or the 480P or what the fuck it is like, you know, hey, it's pretty mind blowing for like, you know, 1980 or whatever, 1990 maybe.
1:14:11
Get your get, bring your friends over after.
School Unlock the cinematic OH.
Well, let's watch it.
Incredible.
Yeah, I mean, I guess like to expand on what Will's talking about a little more.
You like you, you go and like instead of the other levels where like you have to fight through 30 minutes to get to the the stage boss, this one you can just go boom, go and fight immediately because you just go and activate the four, the four twisted pillars which which unseals.
1:14:38
The Lord of.
Greed and then, yeah, I guess you kill him in two seconds and then you're greeted with the, he says.
Hail and well kept.
He's a well keeper.
Now he dies and drops the gold coin which rolls into this thing.
I don't even know what the details are around this to be honest, because it looks like it's a whole other thing, but it never really.
1:14:57
And then he jams the gold coin into his forehead and wanders off to the East Salvation.
I would love that if that was like actually the end game.
Like the?
Diablo like nod or he stuffs a coin into his head.
Oh.
My God, I would love that.
Yeah.
1:15:13
All right, so I would like to talk about the long shadow that Vampire Survivors has cast in solidifying and making standard 30 minutes for a run.
1:15:30
It's too long.
And it's like, I'm not like hating the time that I'm spending with these types of games, but like, I keep looking at the timer and I'm like, like the first time I, I was when I started playing this game, like the first time I consciously checked at the time I thought like without, even without taking a, an extra moment to think about it, I glanced at the time I saw 10.
1:15:56
And I was like, Oh well, I, this must be -10 Obviously it's now counting up because I've been playing this for so long, it feels like I've been playing this forever.
And no, it turns out that I'd only been playing it for 20 minutes, but it felt like, it felt like 40.
And almost every run that I'm doing, it's just like I, I get to the, I don't know, like a 15 minute mark.
1:16:16
I'm just like, all right, here's here's a.
Solution.
Here's a solution.
Yeah, the I think one of the first if not the very first torment items you get artifacts is Scott, I think putting that in our discord like reduces the time from 30 to 20 minutes is.
1:16:35
Just play.
Just play 15 hours of this game first and then you'll of of the more boring parts because it's it's definitely playing the game is less interesting.
This the this unlock the only so it makes it 20 minutes, it makes the enemies faster, it makes you faster.
1:16:52
I don't think there's other like it makes sense that that is unlocked later because you have to like gain basic abilities in how the game works until you get to that point I think.
I feel like that is the opposite of how many games have worked in the past.
Which is the better you are, the longer it goes your skills.
1:17:11
Sorry, say that again.
The the in in almost all like arcade style games.
The better you are at the game, the longer you play the game for.
That's the best design.
No, you get to go further.
I mean, that's.
True, because I just wanted to be conscious.
That's true and even play the Spire if you're bad at the game you don't get to play it as long because you lose and then you start a run over again.
1:17:33
Well, it depends on the type of game I suppose.
But.
But to the game's credit, it sounds.
Like yeah, I think, I think 30 minutes is too long for the starting.
Yeah, but but what I appreciate is that you can, you know, go in and complete objectives and then just end the run like you're not stuck in it, which.
1:17:51
Maybe you can, but I can't.
It is.
Hypothetically, that's not how my brain lets me play video.
Games I stay at the end every.
I get what you're saying.
I get what you're saying.
It's all like sort of locked in there.
And that's great to hear that there's an item that brings it down to 20.
I think that the worst example of this and who knows, maybe it's changed because like I don't think I played the actual final version.
1:18:15
Oh great.
I'm not even going to remember what the name of this game is.
It's called it's it's the vampire survivors.
But like retro FPS game, Scott, you know what I'm talking about?
Like is this.
Crenshaw Land.
I don't think it has land in it, but anyway it doesn't matter this game it's 30 minutes non-stop of just blasting like first person blasting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds event.
1:18:41
It is just awful like.
For this year.
Mark, I believe it came out this year and but so I'm glad that it's it's not quite as as painful, but I'm I'm glad that we're generally in agreement that Vampire Survivors having set the standard to 30 minutes was a little much.
1:18:59
And it's good to hear that the game has some some things that mitigate it sort of unless you're, you know, just as zealous as Colin, which I respect.
Like the game tells you, here is the amount of time and you feel compelled like, well I want to rise and meet the challenge.
1:19:16
Of course, quitting levels early feels like you're giving up.
Well.
I mean there's a bunch of achievements which are related to you staying in so like so even if you, you have achieved all you can, you've sent an item up and you've done all the upgrades.
1:19:31
The one thing you haven't done is beat the Lord and as soon as you beat the Lord Lord No, no, you earn the what is it the fucking heart or the the Shard or whatever, I don't know it looks like a heart.
I don't know what it is, but then that's the meta progression .1% upgrade or whatever the fuck it is the the almost meaningless thing.
1:19:49
But as soon as you have a lot of them, like I said, you get plus 25% of tax speed, which is actually extremely significant.
So, so so every time you're compelled to stay to the end, you get that .1%, I don't know what it is, .1% point. 5% point, 5% for one character for.
1:20:06
One, no one.
That's not true at all.
Actually every character has the.
You know, I was confused by this as well as well, so I understand why you would think that.
But every character gets however many shards applied, so all of them can use the same shards.
1:20:23
I know you're looking at your eyes so.
Each character.
So if you got 10 shards earned, each character would have 10 shards to apply.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
That is a big difference.
Yeah.
Significantly better.
They don't tell you this.
That's no.
The communication.
1:20:39
Is a problem there?
Yeah, they don't tell you that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OK. 1000 pardons.
I was trying to figure out what game I was talking about earlier.
Bloodshed.
I thought you were talking about Impaler, but yeah, that does sound familiar.
Yeah, but Will, are you saying this is how the game handles it or how it should handle it with the shards?
1:20:59
Is.
Is.
Oh, yeah, I didn't know that either.
Oh my.
Thank you for telling me because I've literally been like, sitting, like waiting, like.
All right, well, I really need to figure out which character I like the most.
Yeah, I have like shards, 9 unspent ones.
I've been, I've been holding on to them.
1:21:15
What to do with them.
Yeah.
It's confusing, and I'm glad to have told you all if you continue to play the game, thank you.
Thank.
You now the game does a good job, I think a great job.
The lore so deep the the character, the MPC tells you it's like, oh, when you bring these shards to me, you and I will use them to power you or whatever until like I was like motivated and excited to go and, you know, kill more bosses.
1:21:38
Well, that's great.
That's a good job game.
That's that's a good choice.
That's really the guy.
That's the guy who should become the bad guy.
The script or.
The one who's like, give me all your shards, all like you stronger.
No, it's the capitalist, which makes perfect sense.
You've got this like indie game development studio that's been, you know, putting out games and and putting in hard work and and doing a honest job, honest making an honest living in year old Germany.
1:22:06
In the code vines.
Yeah, and the code mines and you know, they, they, they just, they just, you know, want to be recognized for their, their good work.
And hey, they finally did it.
This game, which had a pretty short development cycle is my understanding.
1:22:24
And from that, that game conference, there was a there was a video from a game conference that Scott sent out to us regarding this game as sort of a retrospective.
And my understanding is that their plan was all right, Let's let's shift gears a little bit.
1:22:41
Let's stop making these huge projects.
Let's do some smaller scope projects and put out a bunch of them and build up kind of this nice catalog and well, ha ha, developers.
Too bad this was too successful.
So now you're stuck just making sequel upon sequel of action RPG survivor light game.
1:23:03
Yeah, could be worse, could be worse.
Fate.
Real, real quick before we start winding down here, the music is great.
I'm just going to point that out.
Even even all the times where I was getting like bludgeoned to death, I was just like, yeah, this is some good like dungeon synth, like border borderline like metal pipe organ music with to perfectly accommodate the the rolling balls of corpses that are chasing me that I'm lighting on fire.
1:23:32
Yeah, feels.
Feels very did.
You get the Bard.
I did not I Well, that's contingent on beating the game where I have not unlocked 30 items yet.
Well, scrub them, and there's a lot more to look forward.
To Will looks so disappointed.
1:23:49
I mean, I, Bard, come on.
I mean, I expect that you of all people not in the sky, Scott gets the limited thing.
You get the maximum disdain because.
No.
I mean, there's a Bard character with as Scott like highlighted it.
Like I'm not sure if that was your abilities.
1:24:04
It looks like you just kind of copied and pasted from someone who actually did the work.
But like it was something where like, yeah, it was like the barred abilities where it's like the the mosh pit and the whatever the fuck.
It was like it's right, right metal.
Related, you should be disdain maxing because there is a barred ability called.
1:24:21
Maxing the wall.
Curmudgeonly thing that I would do, definitely.
That's one of my favorite abilities to get for the the beast countries.
He's disdain pilled.
But famously, yeah, one, one of the I, one of the Abhart abilities is the wall of death, which for those of you who don't know, it's the style of mosh pit where you split the mosh pit, you split, you split the crowd down the middle and the two.
1:24:43
And a half of them die.
And then no.
And then the two halves charge at each other and oh it could not unlike in you.
Know half of them, two die though.
Half of them are deceased, yes.
And the last, like significant one that I was in, I ended up colliding with a a fellow who I talked to later.
1:25:06
He was fine.
But I I ran headlong into a guy wearing one of those like inflatable costumes and it was that of an Axolotl, not unlike previous see a previous previous episode, AKA Axolotl.
1:25:22
But anyway, yeah, so the Bard is the final unlock and is that, does that feel like a good reward for having beat the game?
OK, well it would have been the best.
I mean, I feel like Sage should be the final unlock.
Yeah, because it's the one that's like the meta commentary on.
1:25:39
The game itself doesn't have a main weapon, it just has the abilities.
I mean, probably, but Bart had his own individual attributes which like kind of set it aside as its own special thing.
It should be a secret one where you have to like.
Yeah, it felt, and it felt like it was the secret one to some.
1:25:54
Extent.
Well, there you go.
I haven't.
If I if I could suggest a a reward character unlock, I feel like a tried and true fun unlock is that oh you get to play as one of the enemies.
Wow, that's exactly what I was thinking as soon as you said what should happen the enemy that.
1:26:13
See my my brain immediately went to a dog farting rainbows.
Great minds, great minds.
Wait, what?
Any other can't get over that That one Vampire Survivor guy?
I mean, there's just there's a bottomless pit of of ideas that.
There should be a character where you're playing as the dog and you have a human companion.
1:26:33
But but like the same move sets, like it's just some scraggly human man running around on all fours.
But that wouldn't be, that wouldn't be more appropriate to the Diablo universe.
It should be a like an 88 frame directional cow instead that rolls around and and moves at people.
1:26:52
That would be great.
Well, there is a DLC tab, and if we don't already have a bunch of great DLC, I'm sure we'll be getting more for this game.
And there's already.
Two DLCS for it right I.
Think there's only one the the bog lands which.
The bog lands.
What is up with developers putting out swamp themed DLC as like their first foray DLCS?
1:27:15
I can only think of one other example, but I mean come on, that's not an exciting place to go.
The bog lands, Yeah.
Do we know, Scott?
Do we know what What's what?
Plans Chasing Carrots Studio has.
That's a great question.
1:27:32
Probably some podcast host somewhere has done elaborate deep research into road maps and all those things.
I would imagine that this game could probably get some decent like DLC drops to it, but I feel like there's and maybe I'm I'm showing my hand a little bit for ratings here, but it feels like this this game kind of feels feature complete for what it's going for in terms of like Diablo won the the rogue like or you know, the the survivor.
1:28:06
Like if they just take kind of like the Diablo 2 step to this, maybe it doesn't have to be a survivors like game specifically.
That could be like I think they have a lot of the the they they have a lot of good ideas and directions that they're going with already.
1:28:23
So I don't know what's on the the road map for them.
I wouldn't be shocked if it's just more DLC but.
Boglands only came out like a month ago, so yeah, I feel like they they maybe they can just like, rest on their laurels for a month or two before they announce the next thing.
And hey, they deserve that.
1:28:40
Also, the Bard came out as part of the Boglands update, so that is perhaps why it feels a little bit like a weird special character.
Because it is a special character.
It's like a free free update patch that was accompanying the DLC.
1:28:59
I see.
I see.
Should we rank?
Should we judge?
Get those Torment shards out.
Yeah, I think it's time.
Yeah, time to kick off our last ratings for an individual game until we get to the Omega Bowl next episode.
1:29:19
But yeah, I guess in in classic worst to 1st, who's who's going to kick us off for the the the worst, most tormented, agonizing rating that we have here between Will and Andrew.
Wait.
Who?
Who is worse?
I actually haven't seen it yet.
1:29:35
It's not the same.
That's why that's a joke like.
The joke?
It's rated better than us.
Wow, I guess.
I guess technically it would be Andrew because the overall spreadsheet has rounded to the first significant digit.
Well, and we know Andrew is not really ranking us in on the same scale, so wait.
1:29:52
What?
Thank you for mentioning that.
Yeah, listeners, you need to be aware that my Co hosts, they decided that once as soon as I got acclimated to the wacky weird ranking system, I thought, hey, they're numbers guys, who am I to question them?
1:30:11
They suddenly switched it and my numbers got like ported over and they're just a mess and.
We have to switch it back soon so you can continue this bit.
Behold. 10 years from now.
Behold, I, I it was foretold and it has come to fruition somehow.
1:30:32
We are going to be giving this an overall average higher rank than we gave to Diablo.
Shame on this podcast that is.
This is an outrage.
And even the developers I think would just be oh so bashful and embarrassed to to learn that a publication, a digital pod publication such as this reviewed this game higher than than the classic.
1:30:59
The classic that is Diablo one.
But anyway, hey, the exterminator is great.
This game I really enjoy.
There is a ton of beautiful, wonderful stuff going on on the screen.
There's such a lovely variety in the in the environments and there are so many different monsters on screen.
1:31:21
Whereas in something like, you know, Vampire Survivors, it is a single Sprite that is kind of bobbing back and forth and maybe has like, you know, a few frames of animation.
In this game you've got, you know, 8 directions accounted for for all of these wonderful creatures and they all have unique animations and cool design to them.
1:31:45
A lot of them have unique bespoke move sets which is very nice and this game does tap into my love of schmucks and bullet hell type gameplay at times.
Like bullet heaven though.
1:32:01
Sure, but you're you are having to do a lot of dodging at times at times, and that is you might not, you know, think that you want that, but I assure you you do listener.
So go ahead and check this game out.
It scores 7.98.
1:32:19
Andrew points right ahead of Elder Ring Night rain and right behind Bilatra coming in as my new number 13.
I guess that makes it medium.
I'm looking at our spreadsheet right now, the standard deviation here.
1:32:36
Yeah. 0.1 We're all very aligned.
It's the it's the least standard.
I mean, this is giving the Well, we can't talk about this yet until after Scott and I go Oh yeah, spoiling our.
Scores, you're right.
Let me just never mind and.
1:32:52
I give it a an 8.
Out of 10 and the reason I give it an 8 out of 10 is because Vampire Survivors has 8.5 out of 10 and I don't think this game is quite that good, but it's still got stolen 60 hours of my life.
1:33:12
So I have to give it something and it definitely feels like it's a good game.
Feels like it's a great game, in fact, and I recommend it to everyone who's as dopamine deficient as I am.
That means this hit all the time of that dopamine.
1:33:29
It just accomplished so much.
And variety of characters, variety of things to do.
The progression is extremely intuitive.
Oh well, except for the things we pointed out, it's very intuitive.
And I enjoyed the entire time playing and I'm glad to have played it.
1:33:46
So yeah, 8 SN.
Yes, that means I am next.
I didn't really know where to what random number to put on this because I was like, well, it could be as high up as here, but it could be as like low as down there.
But I wound up settling on an 8.1.
1:34:02
I need to give more more eights out as we go along, which is just behind Bilatro and just ahead of Jupiter Hell on my leaderboard.
Yeah, I think this this game, when I first played it, I'm like, oh, this is like really good.
1:34:19
And it's it stayed good the long like as I kept playing it.
Like there aren't a lot of games that we've covered where, you know, the more that I play them, either I continue to enjoy them the same amount or get better.
But this one was one of them.
And I was glad to glad to stick with it to beat all the different halls.
1:34:37
The criticisms that we pointed out about the runs being just maybe slightly too long, I think I agree with for the most part.
There are times where I'm like, Oh my God, I need more time to satisfy all these objectives.
But but if there was just like a a turbo button or just like unlock the final boss for the stage, now I'm ready for it.
1:34:54
Just give me it.
I could probably probably use that.
Yeah.
I think the the art style for this is great.
I love the Sprite work, the the aesthetic that they're going for.
They just absolutely nailed it.
The music works really well.
The just the overall theme and aesthetic feels like it's it.
1:35:15
It doesn't feel like it's trying to be as too over the top and silly as Vampire Survivors is.
It feels like it's very much taking itself as seriously as a Survivor like game can.
And I think there's a lot of really smart game design principles that are in here for a $6 indie game.
1:35:33
I think like the the quest design system is good.
It's got a good drip of like stuff to do all of like the the progression unlocks for things are at a very good pace.
And yeah, I think an 8.1 feels about right for this.
1:35:49
And I guess I'll.
Bring us home with a very different score of eight point too.
I was kind of surprised I was the the highest of us.
I will say that I increased the score of this game for myself by about a point in the last 36 hours.
1:36:08
I thought it was like a pretty good game, but like a little slow, a little bit like a lacking in something that little Gen.
Issaquah.
But I really do.
I think it's getting better as I've unlocked more stuff like the chaos is growing, the like skill required to play it and the like cognitive load is increasing.
1:36:33
Like I think that's my biggest problem with the early part of the game is that you you're you're there's just not enough enemies on screen.
You can kind of go wherever you want with without too much effort versus like you have to start making like moment to moment decisions once you get to like the agony levels and stuff like that.
1:36:52
So I think post post agony levels, post like beating all the levels, I think that's when it really starts to shine.
And now that we're all here and have finished up with all of our rankings, we can't say that this is the least standard deviation of any game where all four of us have rated it.
1:37:12
We basically all gave it the same score, which I mean, genuinely says this is a pretty darn good game.
For this season, but there is no there's one that outranks it in terms of agreement level.
But Andrew wasn't on that one.
This is on.
I see what you mean of 1 where all four hosts have scored it.
1:37:29
This is the least deviation by a large margin.
Yeah, the last one that we had such a large agreement on was blueprints from way back when.
But yeah, this one is maybe like 3 times.
We all agree that this game is almost exactly an 8.
It's a very good but not phenomenal game.
1:37:49
Well, I mean like on our ranking system.
It is not a it is not a genre inspiring game.
True.
Yeah, I.
Mean it has not.
We're not going to be calling things.
It's not a genre inspiring game torment like Diablo 1.
Torment like is not going to happen.
1:38:05
Right.
Well, Diablo one's bad, so that's.
Oh man.
But yeah, I mean, like Hulls of Torment ultimately on our overall podcast rating leaderboard enters the the town portal at the end of the day at the number 12 ranking out of 85 games that we've we've played for this, which it's nothing that sees that like that.
1:38:30
That feels pretty good, a good accomplishment for it.
I mean, it's just behind Noita and just ahead of Blueprints.
So good kind.
Of I think it's it's a high enough score that everyone should play this game regardless if you think you'd like it or not.
Definitely.
Some similar games to halls of torment we talked a lot about well our just a previous episode to this Diablo our previous episodes CR vampire survivors coverage and hollow cure for similar vampire survivor like functionality, but there's a dearth of other survivor like games that people are are.
1:39:05
I think this is like the short list of ones that are actually good and not shovelware between deep rock galactic survivor people lot like a lot death must die.
I think like people like that game a lot.
I think the voice acting for that is abysmally bad, but maybe that you know, that might be a draw for some people or maybe the art style.
1:39:26
But I don't know how to really pronounce this one.
But like rogue Genesia, GENESIA is one that I played a little bit about for for I think the demo for and that one also has some very interesting gameplay designs behind it.
1:39:43
I'd mentioned earlier Crimson land is is almost like like a top down.
It's more of like a like a like a proto vampire survivors top down horde survival twin stick shooter.
So less of like the giant waves and waves and more of kind of like individual chunky missions.
1:40:01
There's a one called Picayune Dreams which I can only describe as if like.
Hideo Kajima had directed a Vampire Survivors like game.
It's about the only way that I can sum up.
And then there's one by a guy who's put out some.
1:40:20
Actually I should probably put two of them on here.
This one right afterwards there's Voids Vigil, which is like a sci-fi, a survivor like game that has a very similar art style to the other game that this fellow has developed called Bone Raiser Minions, which is as halloweenified as as you could get for a Vampire Survivor type game.
1:40:47
Very fun to play during spooky season.
Very trick or treat encoded to it.
But yeah, I think that's good.
That's going to wind down. 20 minutes is done.
You didn't mention that one, but.
Well, I mentioned the good ones, I mean you.
1:41:02
Know.
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah.
But yeah, 20 minutes to not again, there's, there's 500 of these games on scene.
At the very least.
I, I, there was a, a talk that I gave at Roguelike Celebration, I think in 2023 that I wound up cutting out a whole bunch of slides having to do with the rise of survivor likes because there was just, there were too many to cover.
1:41:30
And I think at the time, let's say we got Choo Choo survivor, we got time survivors, prologue fantasy survivors.
We got, What are some of the bad ones here?
Neon survivors.
Zombie survivors #1 the YouTuber Survivors.
Sea of survivors.
1:41:46
Mini star survivor.
Survivor Survivors.
Cubic Survivor.
They should make a survivor game where all the characters are just other survivor like games.
Yeah, I'm surprised they haven't taken the I the IP from the TV show and applied that I'm here.
1:42:07
So there is there's yeah, a literal bottomless pit of, of games similar in this genre that we could take another 3 hours to to go all the way through.
But but season 3, we, we did it.
We survived yet another oh, I should, I should add yet another zombie survivors.
1:42:27
That's us.
That is US surviving season 3 here.
Oh, and Soulstone survivors too.
Why not?
I'm just going to name them all.
I'll I'll fix it in post, Don't even worry about it.
Which means, what do we have in store for our next episode?
1:42:43
Well, our next episode is everyone's favorite is the the recap episode where we go through and talk about whether or not if our our thoughts or feelings have changed on any of the good games that we have played throughout the year.
1:43:00
And yeah, kind of kind of shocking to see how like I, I usually pull like a snapshot halfway through the season.
I'm like, OK, yeah, I could kind of see this.
And then it's always different at the end where I'm like, I did not expect this game to be there.
And one consequence of this is as I'm reading hot off the hot off the charts here, I think Halls of Torment has just booted blueprints out of the the first round by what of, of the Omega bowl, shot it down to the wild card round.
1:43:30
So we'll we'll yeah, we'll get into it next, next episode.
But yeah, there's, there's some wild nonsense.
There's going to be coin flipping.
There's going to be.
Hey, what's #1?
Well, currently you can't.
Be.
Come on.
Well, currently leading the overall bracket for this season of the of Omega Bowl 3 is our now #2 total overall ranked traditional rogue like Caves of Cud and it's going to be a a bloodbath of us.
1:44:04
What the hell are you talking about?
It's it's going to be a bloodbath of us shouting at each other, going to be a good time of us yelling.
Hey man, wait, that's not #1. #2.
It is.
It is the number one for this season.
Oh, this fire was last year.
1:44:21
Oh, I just assumed that that was, you know, something that's timeless.
You just assumed, yeah, that it was.
Like turns out we don't have to do it.
This fire wins every year from now on.
Well, instead of presented by DraftKings, it can be you're you're drafting your cards from Sleigh the Spire Kings in this case.
1:44:43
That that is a fairpoint will I mean, in the Super Bowl, it's it's not like the the grand champion is dis is is is kicked out of the final match.
Well.
The 1984 Chicago Bears are not coming back for the Super Bowl this year.
As far as I caves a cut this year than I did play sleigh the Spires.
1:45:01
Oh my.
Heresy.
So I mean this is.
This is will only for wills at #1 every year.
So Slay the Spire 2 comes out.
This is this is a good preview of what you're getting next week with us.
Slay 2 Spire.
Slaying each other's.
Yeah, critically, we made it to the end of our season without Slay the Spire 2 coming out, which surely would have been a big upset.
1:45:21
Yeah.
Well, exciting times, yeah.
Get ready for us to be more argumentative than usual next episode.
That's wrong.
We won't be more.
Yeah, and I mean, in the in the meantime, you still have two weeks, if you're listening to this now, to send in your emails to grogpodzone@gmail.com.
1:45:43
You can send whatever final messages you want for the season at our Mastodon Grogpod at Gabe damp dot place.
And then you can see all the stuff that we got all those things, all the above.
Grogpod dot zone.
That's the website.
It's your one stop shop.
Yeah, we got a lot of real fun listener letters for each of the games that that we'll be talking about in that bracket.
1:46:06
And yeah, we'll be going through those.
We got some other fun stuff for Post Omega Bowl, some good interviews from PAX and maybe maybe a special secret to interview that is coming up as well.
1:46:24
So keep your ears peeled for that.
But yeah, until next time, in our next Omega Bowl 3 episode, keep your ears peeled.
Peel those ears as the demons get those ear peelers out to have you listen to the dissonant sounds from the chambers of dissonance from Halls of torment.
