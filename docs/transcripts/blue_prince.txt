Greetings friends and nephews and welcome to the Grog Pod Roguelike Podcast where each episode we randomly slap together some words, unlock some insights, hunt for some underrated gems, and circle back through the boudoir at the end of the year to revisit our best games of the season.
0:32
I am your disembodied dead uncle.
Host of the podcast Scott Burger and with me are my increasingly puzzled Co hosts.
Yeah, this is Will if the black box is true.
And this is Colin, the disgruntled chauffeur.
0:52
Yeah, well, I'm Andrew Harshman, the Blue Box host.
The display is only true statements.
This episode we are talking blueprints Prince, not not the other one.
This this is a a pretty fresh release here Blueprints releasing relatively recently April 10th, 2025, a fresh 54 days ago.
1:18
This is a game that you can find on steam, PS 5 and Xbox.
And this was the debut game by game dev shop Dogubom, founded by an indie film director, Tonda Ross, who I think is also like maybe done music video direction or something and published by raw fury games who have done a number of games that are for sure.
1:43
Stay tuned in half including previous episode fights in tight spaces, but stay tuned for a potential bad N RTS game Domekeeper.
We got atomic crops.
We got Kingdom 2 crowns and Bolianaire Bolianaire other rogue games of note that they have published.
2:06
Your average player of blueprints has about a whopping 42 hours of gameplay in it.
And there's there's there's a lot to unpack here as we'll get to it, but blueprints rolls in on our our steam data set is the 146th most popular rogue game on Steam with 8112 total reviews.
2:30
But first, Colin, you have received a package delivery from yesterday.
Why?
It's a one sentence description of what one does in blueprints.
What?
What?
What's inside that package there?
Well, the package inside the packages, of course.
The will of your dead uncle who is bequeathed upon you a mysterious roguelike house which randomly rebuilds itself day by day as you search for the puzzles of the house and eventually get to the mysterious room 46 at the end of the house.
3:04
Or not if you're me.
So we, we were just hypothesizing how we want to do this episode here before hit smashing that record button 'cause there's, there's a lot to talk about.
There's a lot to spoil here.
3:20
And Colin had the, the brilliant idea of what, what if we just opened up the, the first room here and just hit a dead end and we just hit the rankings right immediately to, to kick out kick out the door here.
So I think like what what this episode will do slightly differently, not like end with or start with end rankings per SE, but like maybe we'll just kind of like go around the horn of like vibe rankings.
3:46
Yeah, like, yeah, vibe rankings to give kind of like a spoiler free indication of what we thought.
And then this I guess will be your spoiler alert warning that I'll tag in the in the show note time stamps.
But from there on, the floodgates will be bursting open and and it will be spoiler mania zone so.
4:07
Pumping them out of the house.
Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler.
Yeah, maybe, maybe I'll, I'll kick us off here.
I like this game a lot.
I thought this game was very innovative.
Innovative.
It was.
4:23
It was certainly like hyped up a lot from like board game friends over the over the past couple weekends, like, Hey, have you heard of this game blueprints?
I'm like, well, don't just you wait, gentle listener.
And yeah, I think I think for the most part it it held up pretty well.
4:42
I think there's some parts that maybe don't hold up so well, which maybe we'll we'll dive into in detail.
But I think generally if if you are a fan of puzzle games and a fan of like Rogue games in general, I think there's a lot to like here with that that synergy between the two.
5:02
There's some rough edges that I think we can expand upon here in a minute in spoiler territory.
But I think, yeah, if, if you are a board game geek, if you are a fan of the board game Castles of Mad King Ludwig and you wanted it in video game form, by all means, yeah.
5:23
Drop 30 coins on on blueprints here.
I'll go next.
I like Scott also heard a lot about it from my board game friends, so maybe we're sensing a theme a little bit.
I I thought this was a pretty good game.
5:40
I think I want people to play it more than I actually liked it.
So like if, if that makes sense.
Like I think it is a great game.
I think many people should play it.
I don't know if it's necessarily the best game, but I think it's it's does a lot of things that are novel and interesting.
5:57
And even if you don't like it a whole bunch, I think it's still an interesting gaming experience, which there are a lot of games out there that you're like, Oh yeah, this is pretty good, but nothing new.
This is the opposite of that, where it's like, I have not played a game like this before and that in itself is interesting and I want there to be more games like that.
6:18
So I think that you should go play it and then come back and listen to the rest of the episode if you haven't played it.
There there you go.
I too am awarding this game pretty high-ranking.
6:33
Pretty high rating, but I think for possibly different reasons than my Co hosts here.
Ultimately, the biggest single factor that contributed to iscore for me is not my personal enjoyment of the Cam per SE, but my respect and and just overall how impressed I am by how well this game wields rogue like mechanics in a interesting, impactful and yeah, innovative way.
7:06
I guess it makes to me, Yeah.
So yeah, loved it.
This game, it did something I've never seen before.
It's got a lot of interesting new mechanics.
And I think the thing I enjoy most about it, as someone who enjoys like no pressure turn based sort of things, is you can just sit there and be like, how do I approach this?
7:25
And I love that.
But the one thing that the, the, the really novel thing is that you take notes, but you have to like in real life, you have a notepad out.
We're all just sharing in our Discord channel here.
Like we all have insane looking notes about all the crazy puzzles and trying to solve it.
7:42
And it's just such a fascinating mystery to try and pull it all together.
And yeah, I love this game.
I I really recommend that you play it.
One addendum.
I think to this before, before we get too deep, I think this is this is a great, maybe not multiplayer game per SE, but like a multi brain game.
8:05
Like if you if you're playing on like a PlayStation or Xbox or like you know, you, you're you're streaming to your living room.
You have like another person there who can just be like, no, I don't.
I don't think that's a that's a a match.
I think that has to do with fire or something.
8:22
You're like, that's an interesting perspective, right I.
Just need to let me brainstorm just literal words with you.
Yeah, Like, yeah.
Yeah, 100% this is.
AI know this is a word letter based puzzle.
I need to like spitball.
Just things that start with the letter F.
8:40
Yeah, and yeah, like sitting on the couch playing.
I, I could see this being a good Switch game, which I'm actually kind of surprised it's not for the Switch yet, maybe.
But like sitting on the couch, like next to somebody just being what?
What do you think of this?
And then just like turning it to them Primo Steam Deck game for that, at the very least.
9:00
But yeah, like busting it out at like a party and just being.
All right.
OK, Colin, it's your turn into the, the, the blueprints maze.
Let's all grab the popcorn and watch and see how far he gets this time.
Or even like the the exact opposite, like you're on a bus, you're like commuting on a bus or something like I think it would be good for that too.
9:19
And she's just asking the bus driver.
Hey, bus driver, what's?
I need a 44 letter phrase for.
I I was like, hey bus driver.
Dude, don't make me tap the sign again.
No blueprints questions.
Yeah, it's I think this is probably a pretty good, pretty good couples game.
9:39
In fact, I just recommended this this game to a couple.
It's it's right up one of their the alley of of one of the potential players.
Problem is have not mastered 2 stick movement, 2 stick first person movement simply cannot do it.
9:55
It's like, well hey, great news, but the other can control it and you can both use your brains to play the game with.
Your powers combined.
With your powers combined, yeah, exactly.
I think I think now, now is probably the safe time to say like, all right, pause here, slam your brakes on the freeway, pull out the Steam Deck out of your backpack and just hold up traffic to just like beat blueprints first.
10:19
And now that you've done that, you you can hit the the unpause button.
And now we're we have entered the pump room.
We're pumping in the spoilers in.
Here, and well, I'm here to offer the other aims, the.
Fog of war out of the pool of the pool of secrets.
10:37
This, this whole idea that like, oh, you got to go in totally fresh, totally unspoiled.
I don't know if that's necessary.
And what are you talking about?
And if we like, let's slip the combination code to something like.
You're probably not going to commit it to memory immediately. 524879 anyway.
10:54
I I feel like that is true for some of these and not true for others.
Like, well, that's a great place to start.
What what do you all think is like so pristine and important the.
Letters on a.
Pedestal that that needs to be not spoiled.
The letters puzzle, it takes a little bit like, oh, that, that is like giving you multiple clues, like the picture, picture, letter, letter puzzle, like that is just a once you've heard it, you know, I don't.
11:21
I don't think I got to this puzzle so but but specifically.
I mean like, like, oh, the car and card.
What's the letter that's different between them?
Oh, it's D cool.
Now that you have heard that, you understand how the paintings work.
11:38
It took me a while to get that.
There's some people, Scott, who who who weren't aware that it like changes, like the room will change every time because the room is in a different position and it's the position on the map, the coordinate map that matters for the the.
11:55
It took me a while to get that.
It took me up until just now to get that.
And I suppose what we're being covetous of is that like, oh, we, we want the players to experience the, the triumph and, and the magic of what, putting those clues together and then trying out the hypothesis and, and seeing.
12:15
Scott, take effect.
If it makes you feel any better, I did get that, and I did get most of that puzzle enough that I'm pretty sure I understand what it's trying to say, and I still don't know what the fuck it's trying to say.
What?
Did you?
What did you get?
I've got almost all of them except for the top two.
I've got all of them except for the top 2 lines.
12:32
My non.
Spoiler and I can kind of there's only so many words that could be in the top one.
I mean, my non spoiler attempt at that puzzle was like, OK, I'm gonna write down each of the painting puzzles as I encounter them and just be like, OK, this one and this one gives me this letter, this one and this one gives me this letter.
12:54
OK, I'm up to I think like I have all all 44 of the letters, but like I just couldn't like I was I was putting out bananagrams letters in like a like on the floor and like rearranging them, trying to feel like what phrases I've I I.
The grid.
13:09
Yeah.
See I never made the connection that it was like it was fixed to the room position and I thought it had to do with like either either like the.
Rarity.
Or rank of the of the room or something and.
There's going off the rails so quickly.
13:27
We clearly should have had a pregame where we or could just spout it random bits of information about this game and and gushed over it.
I mean, I feel like we've already done, we've already done our work for the podcast.
This, the rest of it's just like us bullshitting about the puzzles.
13:45
All right, well ranked it.
So we're done.
So I beat this game, but I'll level with you.
I I don't even know where this puzzle's located.
I don't know what you guys are talking about the and on the.
Walls.
I I'm aware of the viewers paintings.
For the for the listeners, what we're talking about right now is in like in this this there's a when you enter the mansion every day, as in blueprints, everyone.
14:08
Who's everyone?
Who's here has already played it?
Never mind.
Has already played it, so we can we can just tell them what we know.
We know that there are paintings on the walls.
Right.
And I'm aware that those change and I'm aware and I've read like notes and things, but like where?
Where are you inputting this information?
Into some sort of hastily scrabbled together journal that looks like a something that like.
14:31
The Zodiac Killer.
Yeah, the Zodiac Killer would have put together.
Put it together in this in this square.
I see, I see.
I was.
I was imagining that there was a room, a chamber.
No, no, each room position has a a thing and then it spells out a fucking cryptic message.
14:48
Or something.
Yeah, that's that.
Do we now?
Do we think this is some kind of a meta puzzle?
Information about how to open the safe.
It says be sure to drink your Opal teen is what it says.
What it says is.
If we count small gates, 8 datas crack, 8 safes.
15:03
Oh great.
I see well, that's hey, that's something I wanted to talk about right out the gate.
I was just going to come in here and be like, what the what the hell is the safe combination?
Because I haven't been able to figure it out, but apparently this holds the key to all of the safes.
Is this that's?
No, I think there's eight different combinations, but there are.
15:20
They're somehow on gates.
I looked at some gates and I didn't see any numbers on them, so I don't know what.
Well, perhaps it's the number of.
Counts.
They're not.
Yeah, you're not.
They're not.
Yeah, that's actually a puzzle that I didn't like.
I didn't I I got the, I got the whole message written out and I was like, oh great, here we go.
15:36
And then I'm like what the fuck does this?
Mean.
Exactly.
I I didn't know what the fuck it meant.
I, I think I looked it up and I don't know how much time I spent really like digging into it, but like after I beat the game, I'm like.
Now I don't.
Now we're talking about this more.
So I I have not actually beaten it.
15:52
I have not fucking gotten through room 46.
I've had such terrible R&G.
Alright, so so so.
Five runs.
We're very eager, we're very excited to to talk about all the nuances in depth to this game.
I think we we should we should start where like where the story begins.
16:11
And again, we're like everyone who's listening out like they already know all this, but for.
Unless they're they're masochists and they'd have no intention of playing this game.
So I guess they.
Could for those people, yeah, they're just like I I have to hear what the grog pod has to say this time because I have no intention of playing this game.
16:26
But so you, you, you boot up blueprints and it's it's a very slow and dark and brooding intro cinematic where your, your, your great gosh, what?
16:42
Like your your great uncle, your great grand uncle.
Who hails from the uncanny valley has passed away.
I think that's your mom's, your mom's uncle.
So.
Oh, right, so.
Grand Uncle, the great uncle, right, your great, great.
16:58
I think it's actually skeletons.
Removed.
Yeah, but it it starts with this voice recording of of everyone's favorite, most exciting intro to a video game legal documentation thrillers of going through people's wills.
17:15
Hooray.
And I, Herbert S Sinclair of the Mount Holy Estate at Redington, do and see.
I can't even get the legalese right, even.
Though it's OK, you don't have to read the will.
Well, it says here on page subsection 3, part G, that this, this big house that Rich Uncle Moneybags has has kept over the years is is said to be bequeathed to his grand nephew, Billy Sinclair.
17:49
It's in here somewhere, Timmy Sinclair.
Little boy Blue.
Little boy blue that the the above provision and bequest is contingent on my aforementioned grand nephew discovering the location of the 46th room in my 45 room estate.
18:08
And that is your that is your your narrative thrust and your adventure begins and I think like this, this intra cinematic is well done.
It's well directed it it's very clear that like.
Well, we've learned it's directed by a film director of some sort.
18:23
Yeah, and like, this is maybe like, I don't know, one of like 3 cinematics that I encountered in my playthrough of the game that I'm like, oh man, like this starts off like really good like.
Yeah, when the cinematics show up in this game, they they kind of jump scare ya.
18:39
It's like, oh, what?
There's something happening.
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
A wizard.
A wizard is telling me a fortune.
Something exciting is is going on.
I I kid, of course.
Yeah.
I conveniently don't have to read any of this legalese because it has been recorded onto a record.
18:57
What was anyone wildly confused at first as to like what time period we were in?
Well, I was confused like 23.
I was confused when Lionel Huts jumped in and said that like, yeah, bequeathed $50,000.
But yeah, I think like at.
19:12
First I thought we were in the 20s and then it displays the date and we're in the 90s.
Yeah, 93.
You'd think like this this dweeby that like 12 year old boy would be at home playing like Super Metroid or something instead of like gallivanting around unsupervised in this giant abandoned mansion out in the countryside with Nari, an adult to be found.
19:34
Well, his mom is a international terrorist, so he doesn't have a normal childhood.
And I'll point out that like, they're in the game, the security room, and in many other rooms there are computers and floppy disks, and there is a pretty strong indicator of what.
19:51
Sorry to be clear, I was confused for the 1st 35 seconds of the game, but I I thought it was weird initially I was like what?
OK now no.
And just like aesthetically it felt like it was going for like an older time period I guess.
I guess that's maybe just sort of AII don't know.
20:07
They're they're drawing upon inspiration and and architecture and and influences from different times.
There's that in like the clothing style in this game makes it feel like very ambiguously like early 1900s and you're just like this.
This could be like 19 O3 or like 1953.
20:24
And, and what is the main character wearing?
It's just supposed to be kind of ambiguous.
And also, yeah, take into account when the mansion was built.
So yeah, anyway.
So yeah.
Cool set up, exciting.
Oh, mysterious room.
I got to find the mysterious room all right.
Yeah.
20:40
And and so the, the camera pans in over this estate and it it very like smartly like draws you into the the entrance hall, your room number one that you start in.
And when you open up your little map, it I think this is it's it's pretty clever that like, yes, this, this here is your goal.
20:57
You start at the bottom.
You got to get up to the top here where it, it is just ambiguously labeled antechamber with your goal of well, I, I guess I got to get there in order to find the 46th room.
And I, I thought almost immediately that like, this was a red herring of like, OK, you're going to get there and it's going to be some kind of rug pull of like, but room 46 doesn't actually exist.
21:21
At room 46 were were the, the friends we made along the way.
And so the first thing that I did booting up this game was like, I'm not going to fall for this.
I'm not falling for this at all.
I turned around immediately and left the mansion because I knew.
Room 46.
Was going to be down the driveway.
It was going to be down like hidden.
21:38
Congratulations, you won.
Yeah, exactly.
It got the five.
Minute speedrun.
Yeah, Scott Berger, the first speedrunner for this game.
All done.
You you you you pioneered the hopscotch down the driveway.
Skip method hopefully.
21:56
And then then you find out like that.
So there's blueprints, which is the game where you investigate the house.
And then, of course, red prints, which is the first person shooter where you're fighting off the invaders that are trying to attack the home.
Yeah, a mansion defense game.
22:13
The the just righteous common folk have come to of displace and and take back what is rightfully should be theirs.
This whole I I I got some like throughout the game.
22:29
There were some some vibes of like like oligarchy.
I I don't like it.
And everywhere I go, there's this horrible looming figure of the grand uncle.
Is is weird but vacant stare, his evil eyes watching.
22:45
The capitalist capitalist.
Remember that he's the he he.
He did not just inherit that money, he made it by being like Sodexo of this weird fascist country that redacts all of their history.
I mean, we've all been there.
23:01
I mean, yeah, a very, a very common origin story for many a, a Batman villain, as it were, which maybe, you know, possibly relevant for, for the end game here.
But our, our gameplay, I, I was kind of shocked to find out this as well.
23:17
Super like 20 hours into the game.
But like you start in the entrance hall, like there's some stuff to explore outside the house.
Maybe we'll get to in a minute, but your, your first few options are always the same here.
And that like somehow I never made that connection of like the the first 3 rooms that you're able to pick off of the entrance hall, like always come from the same like small pool of things.
23:41
Like a bedroom that has like 1 exit and you get some steps.
Or a hallway that has two exits.
Or like a store room that gives you like one key, 1 diamond and one coin.
Or a den that has two extra exits and gives you a gem.
23:57
That kind of thing.
It it, it always like, for some reason I never thought like, oh, of course there would be like an opening build order to this.
I'm curious.
Like So what?
Does.
StarCraft, I mean you you get like you draw from a pool of cards.
24:13
I'm curious how it builds that pool.
Like is it immediately built after the first 3 rooms or?
Well, I I believe and I don't actually know and I've been actually looked up like the how this works.
But there are some key things that you realize, like the East wing, you only experience that when you're on the east side of the, of the mansion.
24:33
So like the pool.
Yeah.
So the pool of like cards available, you immediately realize, oh, it's selecting from a limited pool for every like stage.
And so you start to wonder like, oh, well, maybe it's like based on my rank, maybe it's obviously it's based on my left right position.
24:49
And so you can kind of establish.
And that's, that is actually how it works.
That's what I'm.
Imagining right, right, right.
And I mean, it definitely doesn't.
Work well, so I mean it.
Works.
It's always picking from a nasty, dank, stinky pool that has been foreclosed on and it's got a like.
It's just the worst RNG.
25:05
Poor guy I.
Yeah, Great Uncle Sinclair's eyes are following you around the estate and they're they're getting a little bit more red every time that you get closer and closer to that antechamber.
And he's like, you know what, I've got to, I've got to put my finger on the RNG button here and, and just completely sabotage.
25:23
Completely sabotage.
I forget where I got this this information from.
I think I might have been from a YouTube video.
I believe that the pool with, with, you know, some like bespoke specific examples like the, the wings that only appear in certain parts of the house.
25:41
The pool is very much based on the rarity of the rooms.
And it is like the way that the drawing, the pardon me, the way the drafting mechanic is, is programmed as designed.
It's like impossible to draw like a super rare room initially, like in your first several drafts and like as you rank up, that's when it's, you know, allows you to access those, those rarer and more specific rooms.
26:10
Yeah, 'cause you're, I definitely did not find a, a ballroom on my like first row of, of of room options.
Or like there's, there's things like like Will was talking about like, you know, there's, there's some options that are like limited to either like the far West side of of the mansion, the Far East side.
26:32
I think like, yeah, there has to be some kind of RNG number under the hood of like, OK, the like the garage cannot spawn more than like 3 ranks that are like below 3 ranks or the bottom 3 rows of of the of the mansion blueprints.
26:50
Get it and.
What?
Oh man, he said the thing.
And in my case, in my case, I thought 100% for sure that the the permanent foundation room that you come across for me was on.
27:08
How would I describe this?
It's like the the second column, second row from the top.
So like you have the anti chamber, the top middle and it's like 1 down one to the left from that.
And I thought for sure what I thought like, OK, like that I've discovered a permanent location of this room.
27:25
Oh, that's interesting.
Like there's there's permanence to this.
And then my mind was blown seeing I think it was Collin's stream or maybe will stream like. 15 minutes ago.
Yeah, like completely different location and I thought.
I also mine.
Mine is central, mine is in the exact middle of the map.
27:44
I assumed that was where everyone's was because it was the middle.
Why would it ever not be in the middle?
And interesting, I I'm also just learning this that it's locked.
I cannot believe your foundation is is right next to the ante chamber.
And at first I was mad because I thought, I thought for sure like, OK, I know, I know that like that.
28:04
So the the rug poll here is that the ante chamber is is locked surprise and there's there's some gimmicky stuff that you have to do in order to get to it.
But the foundation is the real secret here to this this here mansion in that you get to the empty chamber, you get a key, you go to the foundation.
28:24
That's where your end game is.
And I thought for sure, like, well, shit, I've been boxed in.
I got a really bad draw on my foundation because it's all the way at the top.
How on earth am I going to be able to, like, get up there and get to the ante chamber and do all this stuff?
28:41
But in retrospect, having beaten the game maybe a little more than an hour before hitting the record button here, yeah, like, wow, massive luck draw for that, at least in terms of how that system works.
And it it like Colin, when you said that like you had gotten to the foundation to the basement and done all that end game stuff and then you ran out of steps there when I was going through that puzzle sequence.
29:05
That would have made me very angry if I had gotten like that far only to just like not not get the the final win after all of that.
I'm at the point now I have completed that that room in the bottom 7 times.
29:24
Oh my God.
Because it's in the middle of my map and so I don't know if I'm going to get to the top and if I don't do it, I will for sure have to go back and do it if I win.
So every time I get to the middle of the map, I have to make sure I can get into the foundation.
29:40
I go down, I do it, and then I lose and I've done it.
I it's between 5:00 and 7:00 Times Now.
I guess.
I guess like procedural question about like where your location of the foundation is.
So, so Colin, you've you've gotten, I guess we've all gotten to the anti chamber.
29:57
We've all picked up the key.
We've all unlocked the the basement of the anti or the the.
And what a lovely little animation the the plinth coming out of the ground and unfurling, giving you the basement key.
Yeah, like there's there's when this game does like it's cinematic stuff, it's really good.
30:17
I just wish there was more of it 'cause I went like, you know, 20 hours through this game and maybe saw like three of them.
But but Colin, like foundation, you unlocked the the basement door.
Does that stay open for you?
The basement, yeah.
Did you have to go to the anti chamber in order to unlock the foundation every time?
30:36
No, no, no.
It stays unlocked.
OK, thank.
God, so so, but in the run, wait.
In the first what stays unlocked?
I'll or say that again the.
The basement.
You don't have to get the basement key each.
30:52
Time.
Really.
I That's what I did in my winning run.
So that's also almost what I did in my winning.
Ridiculous.
Except I went all the way to the top the the run that I unlocked the basement.
I was fucking bawling.
I should have been able to beat that game.
31:08
If I had realized I was gonna have to go back to that room, I would have won.
I just wasted steps, like poking around in all the corners.
I ran around.
I made my, I had the the power sludge.
So I busted open some walls.
I ran around on the grounds.
I went back inside.
Oh wow Yikes.
31:25
You wanna like full tour?
Like I had like 25 or 30 steps when I went down to the basement and I didn't and.
You still ran out.
Yeah, I still ran out because I was, I was.
Well, I'm just so tired I need to.
Take a little.
Rest I must sit down, my little blue rumpus almost sit in my rumpus room and.
31:44
I saw, I saw the like tube tunnel that goes down to the like the, the second lever you pull and I was like, well, that's definitely going to be the end of this run.
So I'm going to search around and make sure I didn't miss anything.
So I, I, I wasted like 10 or 15 steps before I went down there and then I was like, oh, fuck me.
32:06
And I haven't been able to get back up.
I I like.
I haven't had a run that was that good since then.
What did what did you super?
I'm curious, what did you find super sledging down in the basement?
You can sledge your way out of the basement so that, like you, I can just go down in the basement whenever I want.
32:25
You can get there.
It's not useful.
Really, I like what you've done with the place.
You've really opened it up by sledging all the the walls.
Down I.
Hope these.
Aren't any load bearing bat caves?
This this might be an actual spoiler for both of you, but you can also sledge a wall in The Secret Garden that lets you open both the east and West gate from The Secret Garden.
32:47
Yeah, there's like a conspicuous wall that's like kind of cut out and it's like there is a indestructible wall.
Here it's a very Legend of Zelda looking foot bomb.
Here I had noticed it before and I like had The Secret Garden had unlocked the one door got the like the the thing that gave you the sledgehammer.
33:04
I was like, oh, I guess I'll make a sludge, a super sludge.
That seems fun.
I, I think I've seen some walls and then I, I went back and I smashed the wall.
I never got The Secret Garden.
Even so, I never got into that room even once.
Oh, interesting, The Secret Garden.
You've never gone in The Secret Garden.
33:19
No, I got the key, The Secret Garden key like several times.
I'm like what the fuck is this for?
And I kept like a.
Checking it because I thought it was like something important.
Oh no, no secret garden.
You can get The Secret Garden extremely easily, it's just if you're on the east or the West corridors, or on the east or the West column.
33:40
If you can encounter it a locked door, you can make it into a secret garden.
Oh, it's any locked door on the east or West.
I thought it had to be a.
Green space for some reason, and it just so happens that when I got into it, it was in.
Crucially, any locked door in the east or West that's not the final rank of the mansion.
33:58
Because I.
What?
Was the clue from.
From doing it multiple times.
Well, I think you could say that quite a bit about this game.
Well, let's keep that hot keyed.
Where do you find out this?
Where?
Where do you?
Where do you?
Learn.
I mean, where's the hint?
34:13
I'm sure that you guys are going to say something during the rest of this podcast, so I'm just going to be like, are you fucking?
Kidding me?
Yeah, you, you said you.
Super Sledge.
Oh, sorry, you you find out what the right answer is by first getting the wrong answer and then having your your second brained companion or podcast Co host tell you, oh, actually that that periodic table puzzle, the solution to that is not push the red past nine.
34:38
It's push 3 past 9 and me floundering.
On.
For a week and a half thinking, oh, I'll, I'll look for a red thing to push past a nine and that will that will solve this problem.
Scott, you'll you'll be angry about this.
Do you know how long it took for me to solve that puzzle?
34:55
I watched you on the.
Stream it took you like 15 seconds.
Well, no, no, once I actually, once I actually finally got the lab powered, it took me longer to run back to that room than it did to solve the puzzles, and I was going from one room to the next.
35:11
Room well, well to be fair, like you, I think you transcribed the answer of push 3 pass or push 3 or not transcribed.
The puzzles so it.
Was yeah.
But like, I was playing it on the Steam Deck and I was taking notes down on like my phone on a Google Doc and just kind of like, very like, very like bad posture, cat in your lap, just like, I don't know, maybe it's this.
35:31
So I wasn't like really like trying that hard, but like, I think like a big like my major problem with this game and this game does a lot of really great stuff.
It's very innovative.
But my biggest problem with this game is no digital journal, no digital notebook.
35:49
Like keeping track of all the stuff, all the right answers because I was, I was sitting there.
I mean, I just have a folder full of screenshots, which is the external digital journal, but it's the same, yeah.
It's the same thing with like when you have to go to the wiki on any other kind of game to figure out what you're doing.
36:04
It's it's that.
But there's also something you don't get with that is like you thinking you had the right answer when you had a totally bogus wrong answer for God knows how many days leading you on like some like, and and this is like a very like type 3 fun like level here where it's like, you know, people listening to this will be like, Ah, ha, ha, that's a fun story.
36:25
And like you are, you are rightfully enjoying my pain that I was suffering at the time because I wrote down like all of the wrong like lettered clues for the, the painting puzzle.
And I, I, well, I asked Claude for help on this and Claude said that the answer to that was searching heights for the light castle LIGHT with missing letters of something that was like northeast and like, oh, this is a perfect.
36:50
Like there's something, there's another permanent room in the northeast of the mansion.
I gotta get there and there's gonna be like some castle or something to.
Go.
I mean, that's what you get for asking AI to solve the puzzle game.
Yeah, so, so I excuse.
Me.
Excuse me AI, could you just have my fun for me too?
Yeah, let's, let's review the conditions of this.
37:07
Will I don't believe you're allowed to utilize any items from outside the.
Will didn't say anything about not using a large language model to help are.
You are you able to access the large language model on the the Fallout esque vault?
They were all over the place in 1993 as we I.
37:25
I mean, you know, it's a very, it's a very small language model.
It can fit on a floppy disk.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Let's let's let's back up a little bit.
Well.
Well, to, to to just kind of like clear up my point.
Yes, the thing that I wanted, and of course I will gracefully open up the the the random door to the Andrew room is that I think the the solution here that I wanted was one of my favorite puzzle games of all time, the outer Wilds, not to be confused with the most mid Bethesda shooter that's very similar sounding.
38:00
The outer Wilds has this incredible like journaling system that like you come across a thing and like the game, like auto notes it down for you of like, Oh, on like I encountered this thing.
And it links the puzzles together in this incredibly intuitive and smart way to like focus your attention and give you like things hunt down.
38:20
Like you're only limited to like 5 or 10 minutes or I forget what it is for like a run in that game.
It's not it's not quite a rogue game, but we can talk about like clockwork puzzle games later.
But like it, it focuses your attention and like clusters the ideas together in this brilliant manner that it it doesn't exist in this game.
38:38
And like your, your puzzle solving is like we're sharing the discord, like your madman ramblings in your notebook that are, are entertaining for a different reason, but didn't help me in my enjoyment of the game after like the halfway point.
38:56
And it just became like, I was like boxing myself into the corner with like the dartboard puzzle.
I thought like I had a certain solution to it.
I was totally off.
I looked up the solution like, wow, that's completely different than how I thought it worked.
And I was like floundering for days on just like well this is what I think the solution is with nothing to guide me other than like maybe asking someone or cheating and looking at the wiki.
39:18
Scott, have you gotten to the dartboard puzzle where it starts doing like squares?
No.
OK, so this happened to me today.
It when I was playing between when I got home from work and when we started podcasting.
I did have to look up the thing because I was trying to go quickly so I could beat the game of 4th podcast eventually.
39:39
It just has a square pretty.
Ingenious, subtle messaging.
What could this mean?
Once I figured it out, I was like ah, clever, it's you'd have to square the number.
But I just stared at it for like 5 minutes and I was like I don't.
39:58
So so I I, I I.
Put the dart board over here.
So so so.
My final my final point with the the journaling thing is that like maybe this game doesn't necessarily need it, but if there was like a room or like a meta progression thing that I could unlock in order to help me out as like a dum dum here my my knuckle dragging low brow attempts at like attempting to solve this game.
40:23
Like if there was like that Outer Wild style journal thing that I could unlock as a meta progression system that is optional, I would yeah, 100% hit that button, do what I can to get it 'cause yeah, I, I do think a big portion of this is like yourself rambling journals that like you share to your friends and they just look all, all insane and stuff.
40:43
Like there's a lot of value and fun and entertainment to that.
But for me, like the Outer Wilds just kind of set that standard that like there, there's other really great puzzle games out there like Return of the Oberden, many others that I have in my Google doc as I'm frantically scrolling.
40:58
Botany Manor, The Forbidden City, Majora's Mask, Maybe to some extent the.
Ribbons.
Talos Principle, What Remains of Edith Finch.
These are all like top, like s s plus tier puzzle games that like anti chamber.
Yeah, anti chamber.
41:14
Anti chamber.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, this podcast, you know, we try to keep it pretty apolitical, but we are definitely anti chamber to be clear.
Down the chamber.
So, yeah, I think that if you ask the devs or the director, because this game has a director, which the, the answer to this would be, oh, we, you know, we really wanted to get, we, we wanted to encourage the player to keep a physical manual as, as a, an ode to gaming of old when before we lived in this, oh, this digital age and, and, and to, to, to pay tribute to those old timey video game experiences.
42:00
And then they would pull you aside later at the party and be actually, we really did not have the development time to spare to put together an entire complicated outer wild note system.
I, I hear ya.
One would hope that like at the very least there would be, you know, you open up, you hit the R button to look at the rooms and for each room you have a little space to take some notes or something or.
42:23
Or just they have a built in screenshot taker.
Like I'm going to take screenshots of this shit because I'm not going to write down like there's the music page puzzle.
I'm not 100% sure.
Like I I'm sure that the bold words are important, but I don't know what other words on the page are important.
42:43
I'm not going to write down 8 pages of lyrics just in case I need to remember some of them.
I'm going to just take screenshots.
But if you look at every 3rd letter of every fifth word.
Right, exactly.
I don't know.
I don't know which parts of this are going to be important.
43:00
And I'll be damned if I have to like, go find the ballroom again to find some pages because I didn't write down the other pages in the other rooms.
So like I'm taking screenshots of a bunch of stuff.
Regardless, you shouldn't have to like alt tab out of the game to look at your screenshots folder.
43:19
There should be a way to do that in the game.
And I don't, I mean, I, I feel it's always weird saying like it should be so easy because I know things are always more difficult than it sounds, but screenshots are pretty easy to do in a video game.
43:36
Like even if it's a little clunky, like you could have like a button that you pull up and it's like, here's my scrapbook with all these like pictures I took on my disposable camera.
Maybe you only get a certain number of screenshots per run.
You could fit it into the 90s theme.
You only.
43:51
Get.
You only get.
It's like a Polaroid.
You get you get 5 screenshots per run.
Sure, great.
That would be fun.
And then it would discourage people from just be like, I'm going to take a picture of literally everything.
Yeah.
But I, I don't, I don't know if that really helps me with like me trying to like I, I think that there's this game has like an interesting lore and story behind it, but holy shit, there's a lot of text to go through and like you're you're like reading through like a like a young adult novel's worth of like text here to like you.
44:25
Don't wanna learn about the history of Artesia?
I mean, I've, I've played enough, enough Ace Combat games to to, you know, know where like S Ossetia is and everything and I'm just like, oh, so this is so this is like they're, they're just like, this is the ground level of all these made-up Eastern European countries.
44:43
And.
There's it's like this is this is like a, a fake realm that doesn't exist.
And there's all of like these rich white aristocrats who all kind of look the same and all kind of like have similar sounding names and stuff like, OK, this is, this is fine.
But like there needs to be something like, I don't know, like it was really hard for me to keep track of like who is the, who is the, the author lady?
45:05
Like who's, what's her relationship to me?
Like, why do I care?
Like I'm just trying to figure out this goddamn dartboard puzzle for like 2.
Days I don't, I don't even have time.
Playoffs.
It's your.
It's your mom, author Marianne Marigold, who is Mary Matthew Jones, your mother, who is also Gene Ribbon, the artesian national when you find her false passport.
45:28
Obviously.
Also she's the one who stole the gems from the rival Kingdom and then was maybe drowned for being a political dissident.
Unless you think.
Unless you open a safe.
I don't think that last was true, but it does.
I do.
I did think that maybe she drowned for a while.
45:44
Is that what?
Is that what's in the safety deposit box?
There's a yeah, there's a fake passport.
There's more more clues on that front awaiting you.
Very nice, very nice.
Real quick, I do want to mention the downfall.
The one, the one negative thing about being able to just indiscriminately take screenshots in in the Steam version and and easily access them is that if you like me, you're not necessarily in the mood for reading and you just take a screenshot and say, I'll look at it later and then you never look at it later.
46:11
That was me.
The the story.
I did not unravel much of the storyline.
Much of the back story I wasn't especially interested in it, which it sounds like I missed out on.
I I I in Morrowind?
46:27
Because it does sound interesting.
I collected all the books and I read all of them.
Oh yeah, very lusty.
Or Gonian made in one of the safety deposit boxes in this game.
I I was, yeah.
You know, I'm disappointed there wasn't like a BDSM kink room that you could unlock.
46:45
Like where's the sex swing room?
Just like the the murder Dungeon room, the HH Holmes Murder mansion room that you open up and there's just rusty meat hooks everywhere.
I was you did.
Yeah, you did have a theory, Scott, that the the twist is you get to the anti chamber and it turns out that you're you're at the World's Fair in in the past and it's HH Holmes murder mansion.
47:06
Or like you, you open up the room using The West Wing Hall secret key and you just open up into the into the the back rooms and there's all sorts of like weird laboratory monsters running like this game out.
There in the game Part 2.
Like description I, I had maybe like a minor spoiler at some point where someone was like, you know, you know, Internet comment of like, oh, when when you think it's the end of the game, it's not the end of the game at all.
47:30
And there's like, you're only just starting the game.
Like, OK, so clearly like this is just the Resident Evil mansion Act one part of it.
And then Act 2 is when you get down into the nuclear missile silo and all of the body horror stuff starts coming out Great.
Sign me up, I'm all on board.
47:45
The first person shooter, the Red Prince, the.
Red Prince, Yeah.
Andrew, did you read the Red Prince book?
Sure.
OK, good.
Otherwise, yeah, I'd have absolutely no idea what was going on.
That one I did read.
I'm like, well, this one is pictures.
48:00
I suppose I could read this one.
I kept referencing in discord and I was like, I really hope that they've all read this and they don't think I'm just like roofing off some weird color thing.
But of course that there wasn't.
Yeah, you're like worried that we think that you are.
48:18
Think that you're some master of word play like I'll never think of.
This.
I'm referencing a thing in the games.
Overnight everyone realizes this.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Not to worry.
I mean, we, we got it.
We got it.
I mean, we, we, we had, we never doubted you for a moment.
The, the, the red.
And yeah, I think there's like this game is certainly like chock full of stuff in it between like the, the, the, the children's books that you come across, or like little, little notes about how presumably your player character has interacted with, I guess your brother question mark.
48:49
Yeah.
Over the years in like the bunk or like the the bunk or like the, yeah, the, the two-bedroom bunk room thing, like stories about how you've grown up in this house.
And man, how pissed must your brother be?
I mean, I don't know because I think I looked at that thing once.
49:04
I'm like, I'll take a screenshot of this and read read it later.
I mean, it would, that's, that's the only reference I've found so far.
But it's like, hey, you know what?
My asshole little kid brother who kept writing in my diary also inherited the cool house and I presumably got nothing.
49:21
But he also.
Inherited the.
He also inherited the heating bill for this house and having to pay the servants.
And they've all been let.
Go is out of control for.
This here's your insurance payments.
Good luck with the mortgage.
49:36
Now that I've learned that the great uncle is this fascist dictator, which I was totally joking about, like, yeah, let's overthrow him.
Apparently that's actually part of the storyline, which, hey, that's, that's cool and neat that there's, there's more to it and that it's pretty interesting.
And that's why that historical book is like mega redacted.
49:55
I was just joking about that.
But perhaps the, the brother to the main character, like is is a dissident.
Maybe he became a a freedom fighter of of some sort.
And that'll get you right out of the will real quick.
Ask me how I know.
So he's the real, he's the real Red Prince.
50:13
He's Sophia.
Sophia Prince.
On the red.
Very well read, as it were.
Oh my goodness.
So yeah, I want to just, you know, back up, slow down and go.
Initially when we first started this game and you're interacting with like the the core mechanics, the deck building slash tile placement mechanics.
50:35
Initially my thought was, oh, this is similar to how what we were discussing last week where Buckshot Roulette feels like a board game that has been improved, having been turned transformed into a video game, board game to a video game.
50:55
And by becoming a video game, it has become this elevated piece of media.
But I was having sort of the opposite take initially with Blueprints.
I felt like, oh, this would be so much better as a board game.
Why do I have to sit through this incredibly slow sprinting speed?
51:15
Why do I have to repeat the same content over and over again?
And slowly over the course of the game I kind of soften on that position.
But I'm still not 100% convinced that this wouldn't be just a better board game or digital board game experience.
I think.
I think what's missing out on the tabletop experience is the fact that, like with our accumulated knowledge that we have now, if we see someone like playing the game the first time, they're walking past all of the chess puzzles, they're walking past all of the, the painting puzzles.
51:46
They're like, they look at a safe, like, huh, there's a safe there anyway, moving on.
And you're just like tugging your hair out.
You're like, no, you have to stop and like read that library book.
It's crucial to to understanding the end cinematic of the game.
And they're just like like, oh, hey, there's a coin over here, look at this that's nice.
52:02
And you're just like, oh, but look, look under the the the bed there.
There's there's like a a really crucial thing like look where the finger's pointing like there's all of like these clues just like point like overwhelming you right in the face that you're just completely oblivious to that the.
Environmental exploration that you couldn't have in a board game.
52:20
That you don't get unless you know you're in some sort of like tabletop RPG setting and the DM is like, you happen to notice this thing?
Anyway, moving on.
Or give me a perception role for blah.
Blah, Scott, you're the only one who maybe have you played any of like the newish like puzzle board games where they're truly puzzles?
52:41
Have you played Box 1?
Box 1 No.
Box 1 or box 2?
I heard box 2 isn't as good, but box 1 by Neil Patrick Harris is actually quite good.
It is as close as you're going to get to.
You don't get the like rogue like elements of it, but it is a weird, complicated, intricate puzzle box game.
53:04
What on earth is this?
Yeah, exactly.
It's it's, it's about it's, it's what Andrew was thinking of, except it's not rogue like.
It's much more linear.
It kind of looks like one of those.
What is it there?
There was that like murder mystery movie where like they all get like delivered the thing at the start and they like they have to like, oh, I have to solve this intricate puzzle thing.
53:26
And, you know, you can, like, get all the clues down somewhere, or you can just, like, whack it with a hammer.
Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff I played.
I, I can't remember what the name of the game was, but I played it over the, the Memorial weekend where it was like some, you got a box and it had a bunch of like physical objects in it with clues.
53:44
And then eventually you directed you like a website and we were playing with like app on my phone.
And then there was a bag in it that you had to like unlock with a key that was in there and like a, a padlock.
So there are board games that do stuff like this, but they are very linear.
54:01
It's hard to get this kind of like branching thing because you have to provide answers.
So I think that's what that's what differentiates board game versus video game is that the way that they can deliver answers to you in a video game is just so much more seamless.
54:21
Like you don't have to be like, OK, look in the back of the manual and see if you solved it.
And here's what the answer is.
Which if you got it wrong, you're like, well I can't try and solve the puzzle again because I've now seen the correct answer.
Sure, sure.
Yeah, that's, that's certainly.
54:37
Or they have to do it in a padlock, which is just less fun.
Is a is a great point and this speaks to the greater point that this game is pretty original and like pretty innovative.
And I can't say I've played things that are, you know, similar to certain factors of this game, certain aspects of this game, but seeing things like a hidden object game mixed with a tiling game mixed with a deck building game mixed with a missed puzzle type game all.
55:08
Management, it's got a lot of stuff going for right.
And fine tuning all of that and finding the balance and working out the drafting algorithm must have been very difficult.
And though it's perhaps not perfect, it's it's very good and very impressive.
55:27
I'm curious because we'll beat this game in three days at a blistering pace, which I'm I.
Feel like the real question is how many hours?
20 hours.
OK.
So I've still got five hours until I'm less impressive than Will.
Oh really?
Are you going to beat me?
55:44
I mean, now you have the spoiler so.
I mean.
I should have I should have already beat it by now.
I only I only today missed my first of the the parlor room puzzles and that was because I was trying to go fast.
Wait, yeah.
What did you in the library?
You can see what your standings are.
56:00
Do you know what your standings are?
You've only missed one of the the logic puzzles.
Yeah, I'm on day 18 or 19 and I'd missed the first one today.
Yeah, I I missed I think.
Five I was pretty upset because I was I I still am like looking at like I don't know how I got this one wrong like it seemed like it was 5050 chance.
56:20
Well, I.
Probably, I probably have a less than 30% success rate.
I'm, I'm glad that we're, we're, we're taking time to, to go through the puzzles, sort of 1 by 1 yo the parlor room puzzle.
What a what a deceptively frustrating.
How dare you.
56:37
I took one of one of a few moments that I I specifically noted moments of of of true of pure excitement, the type of excitement that I usually experience like in every room of and of every minute of every FPS game I'm ever playing.
But but I was I was truly excited when I had the opportunity to upgrade the nook.
56:56
I'm like, great, now I, I can stop sweating.
This, this, this darn puzzle.
Now I have now pardon me, what did I say?
The parlor game rather I could upgrade the parlor.
I also upgraded the nook.
That was also pretty exciting to have two keys.
57:12
But the last upgrade that I unlocked was the parlor and the parlor game.
And the upgrade that I chose was 2 keys, 2 spinny things.
So I get 2 guesses and I'm like at last, one of the most unpleasant parts of this game every run is me having to slow down and be like, all right, look, really take your time because if you don't take your time and figure this out, this these two gems could be what makes or breaks this run And like that was very annoying and initially it was like, OK, just you know, read through them critical thinking boom, get through it.
57:46
But then once they start throwing in the, the, the, the double negatives, it's like, oh man, now I got to get out a piece of paper.
Like I can't quite, I can't quite hold all this information in my brain at one time.
I, I will say like I'm pretty good at them.
I can usually get them, but it is a huge change in pace.
58:06
You're like all right time to time to really think here and do some like weird logic puzzles.
That's.
That's a great point.
Yeah.
You're like ripping through the tiling and then uh oh, hold on.
Yeah, don't, don't go too quick.
I mean, like once, I mean it's on average, it's less than one per run because you're not going to get it every single time.
58:27
And so I, I found for me it was like a little bit too much because you're right, it does slow down the pace of the game substantially.
But I really enjoyed those for the most part, except for when I was inebriated and I played the game.
Because when you're like high or drunk and trying to play this game, it's like very difficult to like solve those, but it was very rewarding.
58:47
Well, it was strange.
The white box.
Yeah, the white box just says, don't you think you've had enough, buddy?
I'll tell you.
Yeah.
When you open those gems.
You're absolutely right, Will.
That felt nice.
That was a good reveal when you didn't see the gems.
Oh, man, that was fucking brutal.
59:03
Like the worst.
No.
Yeah, I've been.
I've been outwitted by this accursed parlour chick.
When?
Really, the solution would always be in real life, pick up the box and give it a shake.
There's a lot of times that like the solution here is just like, just hop the fence and run around.
59:23
To the back of the.
Mansion and just break a window, obviously.
That is a pitfall that has has has plagued game design forever as less of a design problem, it's more of like an aesthetic and graphical problem.
But it is even, no matter how immersed I am in a game, I, there's always a little bit, a little part of my brain that's like, well, you know, in real life you could just hop over this picket fence to get into.
59:48
I mean, there are a couple, no?
You could climb over that that mine cart in order to access the lever to get to the to to the whatever.
And it's like when, if possible, I think game designers should avoid that type of level.
1:00:04
Just make the fence higher.
Barbed wire.
I mean like I I get some nasty ass.
Spikes like at the top.
I get, I get what they're going for of like, oh, Simon wants to beat this in the in the clear conscience way in, in the way that that.
1:00:22
In the way a 12 year old would.
That great uncle?
Yeah, like all 12 year olds well known for their calm, rational takes on puzzle solving and not getting frustrated and downloading Nexus Mods to set their keys and footsteps to nine, 9999.
1:00:38
Yeah, I think that.
Was a true puzzle trying to install mods for this game.
I was trying to install the the speed mod just so you can increase the just.
So you keep running hops down the hallway of the.
Game.
Yeah, yeah.
And I could not get the mods to work and I gave up very quickly.
1:00:58
But I say, hey, there's something that we should discuss the ways to make this game even better.
The Bunny hopping you joke about legitimately, if there was some kind of I don't, I don't know what it is exactly, but some sort of interesting, engaging movement system.
1:01:23
If there was some button combination you could do like even just like if you tap the Sprint in a certain way and you like move a little bit faster that that something to just engage the reptilian part of your brain while you're wandering around the house which doing a.
1:01:42
Lot 2 while running.
Yeah.
You have to when you have to casual to the outer house thing like just the run back and forth on that path is like, it's pretty rough.
You know what they need?
Fast travel.
They need, they need the thing that was the prize of all tweens in the in the mid 90's, the Razor scooter and being able to turn your hat backwards.
1:02:07
Actually the Razor scooter was not invented till like 2001.
Well.
You know this game plays a little loosey goosey with.
Time OK, well, well in this E whatever the Eastern European.
Roller blade, Roller knock.
Off skates, just regular old skates, the four wheels like 2 by 2.
1:02:24
And again, you know, I'm not necessarily saying I do appreciate that when you go outside to the grounds your, your movement speed is increased a little bit, but it's like like not quite enough .25 or so .125 times.
But yeah, again, not that's something, you know, super bizarro and and wild like Bunny hopping necessarily.
1:02:42
But yeah, something to make the movement, which is like 70% of this game, more interesting would be would be really great.
I feel like we have to have to defer to our our burgeoning game dev will here.
As someone who is undergoing the game dev process at the moment of like what?
1:03:02
Clearly no game is perfect and I I have a lot I think.
Let's not let's, I mean.
There's your free space on the bingo card.
We have to get that.
But I'm curious Will, from your perspective, like being so engrossed in the deck building process and science, as it were at the moment, like what what it what what is it that like leaps out to you about this game of like they should have done it this way instead?
1:03:33
That's a that's a hard question.
I mean, yeah, I'm giving it a high rating as we'll discuss here, I'm sure shortly.
But the downfall, I think for me as a person, like as Andrew pointed out, like I, I, I'm, I'm in the same camp.
1:03:48
I hate reading fucking tons of text.
And some of the clues and like a lot of the story was embedded in these documents that are like, hey, 5 to 12 pages, you know, pages which are, you know, a few paragraphs each.
But I don't want to sit there for like 5 minutes reading a document and not just reading it, but studying it and having to learn.
1:04:07
Are there clues in here that I have to like, really pay attention to and that for me?
It was just a.
Huge turn off.
Like whenever there was like a oh, here's a document.
I'm like, oh God, screenshot next page, screenshot next page.
I just, I was like, I'm not interested in reading a bunch of texts.
1:04:25
I want more action.
I want more decisions.
I don't want more inflow of information.
I want a puzzle.
I want a challenge.
I don't want reading.
So that's that's me being, I guess, not a very studious person here, but that to me was one of the biggest down downfalls of the game.
1:04:44
The other is just like the fact that the the sort of the narrative structure around a child exploring a mansion like by themselves with like to me, like I I can't connect with the main character.
I am not the main character and because that's he.
Was never a child.
1:05:00
He never just ran around in the woods.
Well, no, just because like I, I'm 37, I'm a 37.
So I was like, you know, this, it, it's more.
Difficult to kill the child version, like reading Harry.
Potter, you know, if right now I was going to pick up Harry Potter and read it, I'd be like, I don't give a shit about these fucking little kids, you know?
1:05:18
It's just it's much harder to connect with them given the differences.
Hard to connect with character, yes, but what about when you unfortunately drew a red card and got the weight room?
I'm sure that was relatable to you, no?
Yeah, but it it drained him a 50 steps instead of making him strong and powerful.
1:05:35
Yeah, that's in the way.
You have been like a gold standard room where it's like become the best version of yourself, go 50% faster.
That would have been bust through walls with the power of your own body.
The Kool-aid Room.
Yeah, I, but I, I do want to say to the point of things having, you know, the gameplay screeching to a halt so that you have to like, read a children's book.
1:05:59
One, something that I appreciate about this particular puzzle game and something that I've had problems, something that I've had issue with with puzzle games in the past is that a huge amount of this stuff is optional and Will and I made it through this game well enough without reading all the war.
1:06:20
I was worried at some point, like I was just, you know, like putting off and deferring this this big, huge amount of reading and studying I was going to have to do later.
But luckily that that didn't happen.
And the fact that you don't have to solve every single puzzle, you're not going to get hard locked behind like one specific clue that you missed in a library book is is really great.
1:06:43
And I I tip my hat to the designers.
Yeah, I think.
That's a good, that's a, that's a really good point about this game is that the volume of puzzles makes up for the fact that it's all puzzles in some ways, like the worst thing about a puzzle in a puzzle game is not being able to solve it and then being not even soft lock, like hard, hard lock, like I just cannot get by without solving this puzzle.
1:07:10
And then you go to the wiki and then you start looking at the wiki and then the game's done because you've just looked up all the answers.
Like I think that's the, that's the downfall of of many puzzle games.
In this game it is a risk of if you get too frustrated, you just start looking up the answers and it's hard to.
1:07:30
Just look up.
Yeah, it's hard to just look up 1 answer like, well I'm already on the wiki for the boudoir, I guess I should click on Oh oh there's an just.
It's literally one click away from finding out the other secret too.
And that's why I think this game is optimally played with like 2-2 or three other people for your video game podcast, ideally that can like help to provide that input of like, you know, some maybe someone who has already beaten the game to just kind of like nudge you just a little bit of like, did you check out this thing?
1:08:01
You're like, no, I didn't even think to look at there.
And then like giving you just that little bit of hint to go on or like Outer Wilds has suggested, if you don't, if you live out in the middle of Nowheresville, Nebraska, and the next person is like 15 miles away from you, maybe having that kind of system integrated into the game of like, I don't know, a rumor system or.
1:08:21
A small language model.
Yeah, a small language model that like you would think that like your, your campsite would have like all these accumulated clues and stuff of like, oh, this relates to this and this relates to this helping to kind of like focus your attention and guide you along the way.
1:08:36
But yeah, I get that like the the conceit here is that like it's puzzle game, you're supposed to puzzle it out potentially with friends.
But if you don't have those friends, then the Internet becomes your friend.
And as we all know, the Internet is a bad place to go to for friends.
I think my my biggest head scratcher for this game is, is the RNG and that like I know, I know when people like obviously people complaining on the Internet, Oh, video game bad because blah, and you know, opinions and assholes, etcetera.
1:09:10
And I'm willing to to join into that right now.
So I think the the randomness in games like this is fine, but you have to be given the tools to mitigate it.
If you are just like randomly drawing stuff and you're just like, well, like, I know, I know what the strategy is.
1:09:29
I know how to employ the strategy and the game just like fucks you repeatedly with bad draws.
You're just like, well, what, what could I have done in that scenario?
And and well, all right, so I'll wrap up my point.
No, you're wrong.
I'll wrap.
Up so I think things that this game might benefit from are having like an explicit discard pile so that like oh like I have taken this out of the deck and it's in the discard now now I like it's a deck builder it should like behave like a deck instead of just like and like when.
1:10:00
You come that.
Furnace to the graveyard.
Let's get it out of here.
Yeah, like there's no deck milling.
You can't rotate rooms in this game, which kills.
Man.
Other than the.
Rotunda you can.
You can.
So when you draw a room, you have the option of saying, oh this, this library, I can, I can make it go from this orientation to this orientation.
1:10:20
Yes, 20 hours in, this has not been made apparent to me and I think maybe actually goes a point against it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can do that as an upgrade later in the game or you can do it OK.
I was just saying if there's something that I've missed up to this point, I am going to degrade this game by like a full point.
1:10:40
No, I mean it's like you, you get it later.
Like that's the thing, meta progression.
That is significantly better than what I feared.
Which was there some mechanic that I have missed?
Yeah, the meta progression solves all your complaints, Scott I.
Don't think it solves it hard enough.
That's the problem.
I think I'm too I'm too dumb for this game.
1:10:56
Is the issue is that like I what I want is like when you uncover like an ivory dice, for example, to reroll your room selection, that should in I think, in my opinion, I think that should build up like an initial starting pool.
Like every time you get a new ivory dice, your next run, you start with like plus one extra ivory dice and it it it's like a meta progression to like soften the blow of like all your bullshit, like bad draws.
1:11:24
And yeah, I know that the meta.
Progression's a little too slow.
It's too slow like the puzzles in order to unlock the stuff like like I I unlocked the the like the car thing to get to the West, like the West ground.
I unlocked the apple orchard and the gemstone mines and I thought like, OK, these are like good puzzles that like apple orchard spoilers related anyway that would have that would have solved yourself.
1:11:49
Why didn't?
You just say to me, you son of a bitch, that.
Problem.
That problem gets solved by that.
Anyway, what the?
Fuck is the apple orchard?
Did you not run around the grounds?
I did a.
White picket fence back, kind of behind your tent so you can potentially miss it.
1:12:07
Did I just not run around far enough?
Yeah.
You didn't like so we are the.
Three of us here.
We've all.
Yeah, we've all.
Well, there we go.
There's the thing I was waiting for the one where I'm just like, oh, I guess I'm just an idiot.
I've gone back to the tent I found if you guys dug up the the thing between the two.
1:12:24
Rocks and the bridge.
The bridge.
Well, I don't know that you want that.
For.
The other big thing inside The Cave, something that I thought was interesting about the apple orchard, is that if you wanted to brute force it, it wouldn't.
1:12:41
It wouldn't even take that long.
Like it's that was it was wasn't it 9999 combination.
No, I think it, well, I think it's, it's nine.
Well, I mean, it would take a while, yeah.
That's a long time.
Hold on, hold on.
1:12:56
I have a story about brute forcing.
But compared to like being in the middle of that set I guess is what I'm saying.
It's like 1-1 something something I forget.
What?
So when we were playing this puzzle board game last weekend, Memorial Day, there was a padlock.
1:13:11
It was a three number padlock and we knew that the first number was 7 and while Joe and Alexander were trying to solve the puzzle, I brute forced the 99 combinations until I it was like 53 or something and I just, I just like guys, it's done.
I did it, I did it.
I just brute forced 50 numbers and we found it.
1:13:29
But then.
You would have, but by doing that, Colin, you lost out on the deep, intricate story hints from the from the dark room that maybe that that's your that's your, your second brain, a puzzle hint of dark room to apple orchard hint hint.
1:13:47
I've looked at everything in the apple orchard.
I mean the dark room.
Did you know?
Did you how close?
How close wink wink did you look?
Hint, hint magnifying glass?
Did you use for Anyway?
I think like.
I mean, apparently I've looked at everything pretty closely, but not with the magnifying glass so.
1:14:08
Well, there you go.
I think that, yeah, like, so like my, my major point, I think that RNG in this game is bad.
I think that like you need, you need to be given more options to, to counteract bad draws.
And I know that there's like, there's a good level of like gaming, like the card pool to like tilt the RNG in your favor, but even that doesn't guarantee that you'll that you'll overcome it.
1:14:33
And the only way that I could overcome it was getting like, you know, going through what was it like 16 dice rolls or something on my winning run through, just like scaling my way that way.
And even then, it still didn't feel guaranteed.
And like, by the time that I got to the, the, what did I call it?
1:14:51
The the Costco warehouse socko bond puzzle underneath the mansion.
That.
If I if I didn't have like 9999 steps still I would have been like wow I would be really mad if I ran out of steps here having gotten this far.
1:15:07
Well, you only have to solve that puzzle once, so.
Yeah.
Wait, is it?
I didn't.
It didn't even occur to me that.
Does that specific puzzle take up actually keep track of your movement?
No.
Like is it possible to run out in that room?
In the basement room, No, it doesn't take us.
1:15:23
But transitioning from that basement anyway to to the stuff beyond the basement does take up.
Steps beyond the basement.
If you're like me and you're like coming across the the minecart and you're just like, Jesus Christ, another fucking puzzle.
Like so close to the end of this.
Are you kidding me?
1:15:38
I hadn't done that.
I had to go back like I had done the tune before and I hadn't quite, I hadn't like repositioned the the thing in a in the right way.
So I had to run outside, go, go into the tomb, rundown it, move the thing, run.
Back yeah when when I got to the very end of it I, I got to the gear that gear chamber thing and I thought OK now I'm going to have to go through different branches and like on I thought there was going to be like 3 or 4 sequences but then it turned out there was just one sequence of oh I need to go into the tomb and move the minecart so I was a little and this whole like that's only when the game really begins it's like.
1:16:15
Once you solve that, you never have to interact with it again.
Which is swell.
I can't believe that you the basement remains unlocked.
That is ridiculous.
How would you know that you would test it?
Because you how would you test no ability?
Because there's nothing else in the game that indicates.
1:16:33
I don't know, I guess.
Well, because you have no other thing to do except for really.
Well, I guess I'll lose this rod.
Like, can I go down in the basement?
Is it?
Oh, I went to see if the door was open, and then I see it wasn't.
And I was like, well, like, is it unlocked?
I suppose.
OK.
I feel like this would be easy to miss and I feel like there should be a little message like we'll prop this open, let's leave it open.
1:16:54
Hold on, this is an unrelated to any of these things.
Oh yeah, they should have a little Zelda sound when you unlock something good.
Every time I did something good, I was like, and it didn't do that for me.
I had to sing it out loud to myself and it made me a little bit sad.
1:17:10
I.
Even have the.
Little they have the little chest there with keys in them.
You open up, you get the key banana and you got the grab 1 hook and now you can transfer through the rooms.
Just to look, it doesn't have to be an actual Zelda motif, it could be any motif.
Sure, it has to be Zelda.
I think this game, this is another place where the game could be improved significantly.
1:17:29
The IT needs to like take notes from something like Bilatro or like the the output, the stimulus of like rewarding your brain for like doing something is not really there.
There aren't really fun sound effects, especially the scoring screen is super boring.
1:17:47
Like if if the scoring screen was more action-packed and like if it was more impactful, like I'd feel like.
Party Pop.
Dude Scott, is this a solo dev?
No, this is this.
Is like a small studio.
Yeah, it's a small studio.
I don't know, I was reading some stuff that said that it was it was a solo dev for a period of time.
1:18:04
Yeah, I got, I got that vibe of like very small team.
I feel like they could add some more music.
They could add basically Minecraft style music where it's just kind of like subtle melancholy music.
1:18:19
I think that would actually make it quite a bit better because like they add, it is impactful that they add like some music stuff when you do big things and it's like, wow, this is very different because there's not really music for the rest of the game.
There's but it doesn't make me sad that there's not like good music for the rest of the game.
1:18:37
I think I'll push back on the music front because I think Andrew also said in the discord that the music in this game was was like mega mid or whatever the phrase was.
I.
Think I called it a nothing burger.
And I was like, is that true?
I remember like this game being and like I fired up the Witness because I felt like the Witness was also similarly extremely quiet.
1:18:55
But I think like Blueprints actually has like a pretty decent soundtrack to it when like you stop and just kind of like listen for a second because you go into the tombs and there's like this, like it.
Only has music when you go into interesting spots though, That's true.
You're going into the parlor.
1:19:11
It's basically silent.
You want parlor music like.
No, I want basic Minecraft music where it's like.
Actually, I prefer the parlor to be completely quiet because I need every ounce of my brain power to make sure I don't lose those damn gems.
1:19:26
All right, fine, the kitchen.
Right, right in the main part of the house.
I want the kitchen to have like old time radio, like Nirvana.
The whole time 90s radio.
Yeah, what?
What was the What was the Eastern European 90s Nirvana?
Excuse you, this is not Europe, this is Cracovia or hold on Artesia.
1:19:50
Which critically has a very important trade deal with Valverde.
It should be noted that is a piece of lore that I do know about.
That's the, that's the place where.
Arnold goes to to to get his daughter back.
Right.
Correct.
OK, little commando ref there.
1:20:07
Yeah, I think like, I think this game takes place on an alien planet technically, because when you go into the observatory, like the continents are all like weird and it's oh.
Yeah, that's.
True.
So technically this is probably in the far future.
It's probably like 3093.
1:20:22
It was a Twilight Zone episode all along.
And that.
Like it's definitely in like a different Earth, altered Earth.
Well, this, well we've established that this is post portal gun technology as established by all the different rooms and the portals adjoining them.
1:20:38
So that would make that would make perfect sense.
So really this was the the Portal 3 all along that we never knew that we had this whole time.
What else do I have in here for discussion topics?
Oh, how do we feel about the price of this game being $30?
1:20:54
Price is relevant.
It's a, it's a AA game.
Well, maybe it's, maybe it's A and a half, I don't know.
It's a AA game.
So that's I think it's fairly appropriate.
We, well, a lot.
Of content for your money.
Frequent writer inner to the the podcast Davian Fuchsa has Davian dropped us a message here.
1:21:13
So yeah, I'll read some of his letter he sent in.
And I think this was in relation to our our previous episode about the, the free to play game 45 that we all love and Collin's saying like, you know.
You know what?
We covered 45 episode before the game with the Rogue 46.
1:21:33
Holy moly.
We should have done that one for for our 45th episode, but but yeah, Davian writes in again.
Thank you again to say basically in response to Collin's comment in there about how 45, you know, free to play game, but it's less about like the price and more about like the like, how much how much time are we willing to invest in a game?
1:21:58
And so Davian writes into us to say, have to wonder a bit about not factoring in game pricing on scoring.
Doesn't happen often, but sometimes you get those games that are wildly overpriced.
You really have to second guess a recommendation.
He kind of goes on about like a bunch of traditional roguelikes.
1:22:13
I'll skip over some of this, but yeah, I think like I think mostly what what David's trying to drive at here is like, you know, there are games that are priced like 20 dollars, $40, you know, traditional roguelike games very like intricate and like or very like very niche for this already niche genre.
1:22:35
Things like approaching Infinity Cardinal quest to other like vaporware type games that people are still charging for.
I I felt like $30.00 for this game felt justified and I did not feel that case for the $40 Darkest Dungeon 2 when we played it.
1:22:52
Absolutely.
That launched in and out mess of a state.
But I think I'm, I'm probably in the same boat as I am with like graphical quality, where low, low graphical quality doesn't really do much in a way of like hurting it for me versus low price doesn't help that much for me because I'm still like you're the cost is both your time and your money.
1:23:20
So if it's a bad game and it costs very little, it still cost you your time.
If it's a bad game and it costs a lot of money, then it's doubly bad cost.
So like, and you know, like the difference between $0.00 and $10 is pretty, I, I mean, this maybe feels a little privileged, but it's like, that's not that much money to me.
1:23:42
So I don't care that much.
Like I'd buy like a $3 soda every day because the vending machines are expensive.
But like, if it were $60.00, that starts being like, OK, this is real money.
1:23:57
I would have to spend time to earn that money.
Yeah, and I think that like the there there's AAA games that now I think are starting to March in the direction of $80 as a base price point.
I think it it will, it will be unsurprising that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be $80.00.
1:24:15
And like, maybe that's a good thing for like these these like more indie games here on the end of the spectrum of like, well, like maybe blueprints like $30 all of a sudden in the in the shadow of the $80 norm isn't so bad or like I think, I think.
It's the, it's the time per dollar.
1:24:32
Like if I'm spending less than $1.00 per hour on a game, then like that's pretty darn good.
So if it's zero cents per hour or $0.15 per hour, it's like these are in, these are the same number.
1:24:47
If I'm paying $80.00 and I'm spending 10 hours playing this game, it's like $8 an hour.
Like that starts being like, maybe not the best use of my money.
Your value prob.
Yeah.
Versus, I'm at 15 hours for blueprints, so that's $2.00 per hour.
1:25:04
You know, it's not nothing, but I think it's worth it for like the game that we've played.
I will say that if I had to pay money for this game, there's no way I would have played it just based on my temperaments, gamer temperament, that that would not have happened.
1:25:24
But now that you have played it.
Oh, no, no, no, I.
For your prior self.
Certainly, yeah, if if I had to go into some kind of Terminator time travel mission, certainly I, I would.
I think it's I think it's worth the money.
What if there was a a demo preview or a lot of games these days are doing like free prologues where it's like, oh, like this game is coming out, we're going to charge money for it.
1:25:46
But the first chapter of this game is is free.
It's a.
Yeah, I'm, I'm quite a.
Demo but sure.
I'm I'm happy that demos are coming back or demo like offerings, free samples are are coming back.
That's very cool.
Yeah, it's 30 bucks.
1:26:02
I think that that sounds about right.
Also 15 to 20. 20 is the right those that's the right number.
What's how much does latest latest buyer cost?
I think it's right now it's on discounts because latest buyer 2 is coming out hopefully on Friday.
1:26:17
I'm really crossing my fingers, but the point is that game's like 20 bucks at the most, and so if that game is $20, every other game should be less than $20.
I guess.
Well, yeah, I mean.
Well, there you have it, folks.
The the definitive market analysis, all all of your budgeting has been solved for you.
1:26:36
Thanks for listening in on the Grog pod as as always.
That's right.
That's right.
But yeah, how do I guess maybe like another bullet point I have on here, how do we feel about the ending to this game or, or do do we want to spoil the ending for Colin here or are we?
1:26:52
I actually don't I, you know what I said that we're fine with all spoilers, but I actually don't, I don't want you to spoil it now that now that we've gone through, that's fine like an hour and 45 minutes of.
Talking to this game, I spoiled everything else about the game, but yeah, I I do want to talk about the maybe not like having to do with like the the end game per SE, but the the rumpus room.
1:27:17
I think I want to talk about where you get to the coin operated fortune teller and this was like this was a major moment for me of like, yes, I'm locked in.
Give me more of this you.
I did like, so Scott was watching my stream the first time I saw we, we, we've been streaming this game occasionally to each other.
1:27:34
He was watching my stream the first time I got to this room.
He's like, you should, you should get that one.
I was like, oh, I don't need money.
He's like, yeah, you should go to this one though anyway.
And, and you know, you're, you go up to this Mechanical Turk fellow, you drop a coin in and it like jump scares you into a cutscene.
1:27:50
You're like, Oh my God, there's production value in here.
What is this?
Doing.
That's where that $10 went.
Yeah, $10 what?
However much it's cost.
And it's, yeah, you can do the motion cap for the mechanical fortune teller.
And you are, you are treated with this very nice, like well rendered, well voice acted, haunting performance of this robot who says I, I foresee all sorts of weird things in your future.
1:28:18
I foresee a black cat with a red flag and all these other like very symbological things going on like, and I'm sitting there.
Frantic taking notes symbology.
Did you mean symbolic?
Do we ever actually see a black cat with a red flag?
I don't think so.
So he's really just making things up.
1:28:35
I think he's just a liar.
Yeah.
And you're.
And they're entertaining lies.
And in the end, isn't that the real truth?
The answer is no.
Because I think, like, I'm sitting there frantically taking down notes, like black cat red flag, like, fully expecting to like, all right, I'm going to turn.
1:28:53
I'm going to, like, open up a door.
There's going to be like a black cat sitting there.
I'll like, turn away and turn back and the black cat will be gone.
Or like some other like weird jump scares, 20 hours beat the game, never saw anything having to do with that.
And then I thought, all right, well, is this just like another like complete red herring of like and like that's that's part of my frustration is like, I don't know which of these puzzles are relevant to like completing the game because I feel like that's the main, my main focus is like, I want to complete the game and like there's all these interesting things to solve along the way.
1:29:25
What like, how do I know when to divert to go And like, am I supposed to hunt around the entire estate now for a red flag?
Is that like crucial to to like solving the, the Riddle of the mansion so I can get to the to the crypts and get to the the the undersea castle that's being protected by ghosts?
1:29:43
Prince the blueprints is beats the cat Prince who holds the red flag.
It was there all along, it was just, it was right in front of our face this whole time.
Yes, Robot's dream, that kind of thing, Yeah.
Uh huh, Uh huh.
Do we?
1:29:59
Do we want to head into into more authoritative, detailed, definitive, final thoughts here before before we start rapping?
I would say so I.
Think I think it's time for the official rank numerical.
What what will pop in that rankings key and turn the turn the the lever to open up the rankings room?
1:30:21
Punch in our 8 digit ranking code and open it up to find the definitive.
Ranking slot yeah, I'll go first in shocking fashion this time.
I I like this game.
I think this game was super unique.
1:30:37
I thought this game, I thought blueprints did a lot of neat things, maybe not perfectly, but maybe like the first to try to do them.
This kind of style of like of randomized rooms joining together to like solve some kind of quote UN quote dungeon purpose.
1:30:58
It's something that I've wanted from like a legend of Grim Rock game for a long time and I feel like no one's really figured out how to do it until now.
And now I'm super excited to like.
For all the copycats.
Yeah, for all of the the blueprints, lights or likes out there that will inevitably pop up.
1:31:15
And I'm all for it because I think like this is a super, super neat and innovative way to approach this kind of puzzle design.
But lots of like Resident Evil style, like mind games of the puzzles going on, lots of creative things.
And like, yeah, when you see someone who's never played the game before, you're like, oh, you got to go and do this thing in order to see this and you're holding back a lot.
1:31:36
I think that's a lot of fun.
The bad things I think are do stick out.
I don't, I don't think they can be ignored.
Like I think the RNG is bad.
I think the the tools that you are given to mitigate the RNG are also so bad and slow to uncover.
I I get that there's ways to get around that but for me maybe I'm just too dumb and that I just I want more of it.
1:31:59
Just give me a shorter on ramp.
I feel like it shouldn't take me 15 hours to unlock the full meta progression and even that like didn't really seem like it made that big of a difference.
And this game needs a journal function like #1 criticism, like if you do not have a second brain to to bounce ideas off of, you will be rabbit holding to bad answers for days on end like me again, because I'm stupid.
1:32:22
But if this this game just had like a, an automated like this thing is connected to this thing and you should care because it connects to this thing over here.
Oh good.
Now I have like a visual thing to kind of follow that would that for me would be like a full extra point on my rankings.
1:32:38
And I'm going to give it a a 7.7 just behind hand of fate or I guess tied hand of Fate to just behind Riff wizard and just the head of like dot age and with the last spell.
I think like these are all like solid games.
Maybe just kind of like held back a little bit by like 1 little nitpicky thing.
1:32:58
But like this would be like a solid like 8.5 for me if it had that automated journal function to it.
And maybe I'm being a bit picky.
But yeah, overall I think this game is great.
I think.
But if, if you've gotten this far, then like, yeah, you know that this game is fun and great and yeah, be be that second brain to someone first playing it for the first time.
1:33:19
Be be that kind of like gentle hint giver and like nudge pusher to be like, maybe you shouldn't really focus on this just yet.
Go and go and try this other thing first.
And then I think that that person will like that.
That'll be a great way to spread the fun and interest of this game for for new players.
1:33:37
I guess I'll try them in here yeah I I think I I keep this game an 8.5 which for for will you know that's a.
That's a highly.
That's a highly rated game right there.
This game is great.
I absolutely loved it and to the extent and, and and this is how I know I loved it.
1:33:57
I was not planning on taking a day off of work to play it, but I beat this game in three days as a result of being like, oh, you know, let's let's OK, here's the grog pod game.
All right, let's just here we go.
Let's get into it.
1:34:13
And then suddenly I'm like, oh, no, it's the end of the day.
Oh, oh, no, it's tomorrow.
And.
I'll just play a little.
Bit in the morning and suddenly it's, you know, at the end of the day and I'm like, well, that's how it goes, isn't it?
I if you if you lose all track of time and you're just wrapped up in a game, that's that's a great game right there.
1:34:33
And an 8.5 is a great game.
I mean, it's not a it's not a rim world, it's not aspire, it's not an inscription, it's not be a landlord.
But you know, it's it's a great, great game and I love I love that it just innovative, this whole new way of approaching deck builders and of this whole like first person perspective, like run through a mansion with this like this, you know, with this set of like a grid style and all these puzzles.
1:35:03
Oh my God I love this game and you should play it.
Wow, wow wow high praise, high praise.
I do declare well as we all know I joined this podcast late and well my my Co hosts.
1:35:21
Let's just say they are three boxes in a parlor and they are just out to betwixt and perplex and bamboozle me because the ranking system changed and my ranks are all janky and screwed up.
So don't get too hung up on my numbers.
1:35:37
That being said, I've given this game a pretty high score even though my my scale is all messed up.
Blueprints comes in at my new number 10.
To be clear, Andrew has now played like 2/3 of the games that we've played so.
1:35:55
You know, it's really a you can't lean on that.
It's really a doomed battle, doomed endeavour.
I'll be sure to change up the ranking algorithm again next week.
When we and I've awarded this game 7.9 points out right behind Bilatro, right ahead of Remnant from the Ashes.
1:36:12
And So what else can we say about this?
What else can I say about it?
First of all, the level design sucks.
The level designer needs to be fired.
Oh wait Oh no, I was the level designer all along.
What a shame.
1:36:28
OK so check it out. 70 ish percent of this game is just wandering around and something needs to be done to make that more engaging and more exciting.
1:36:43
Exciting, Some type of a novel, fun.
Just a little, a little stem movement, stem of some kind that you can do.
What if it taken That would have improved this game quite a bit in my opinion.
The scoring screen I think would have really been been it could have been ratcheted up and made more exciting to give you the sense that you're making progress.
1:37:05
Because there was a big part of this game, there was a decent stretch where I got to the ante chamber.
The ante chamber was locked, which I was surprised by.
And then I felt very rudderless.
I'm like, what do I do now?
And I was encouraged to like, we'll explore, you know, find more rooms and things like that.
And if the game was like more encouraging of that, if the game was more rewarding in the, in the visual and audio like feedback that it gives you, I think that would have helped that issue.
1:37:32
Fortunately, I wasn't dealing with that for too terribly long.
The music I, I think is is is they kind of it's some combination of like phoning it in and like trying to play it safe.
Like let's not make anything like too hyper specific or potentially offensive to the ears.
1:37:48
So let's just make it like super boring.
Like somehow the in my opinion, a spoilers for the ending that the music at the at the credit screen I think is like the best piece of music because it actually has some melody and is going somewhere and has something to offer.
That being said, the music wasn't like offensive and there are like certain sections of it which which to convey a tone that I think are pretty good.
1:38:11
I think this game could have been brought to that level of greatness with more dynamic room stuff going on.
Like when you get to the antechamber and the pedestal comes out and the IT unfolds and this key is there.
Like that's very cool.
1:38:26
Like more dynamic room shit going on.
Think would have helped potentially like random events that happen that aren't necessarily like mechanically important, but just like something to kind of keep you on your toes and be like there could be some new fresh material waiting around behind this door or some kind of storytelling through voiceover like in rooms would have been really appreciated.
1:38:50
And then my last bullet point for like how this game could have been better for me would be if this is a horror game, I think it'd be like infinitely better.
Like if there was that tension of like of Oh no, I could something horrible could happen or I'm being stalked around the spooky mansion.
That would be great.
But I I get it.
That's, you know, from from the ground up.
1:39:07
That wasn't the idea for this game.
So to, to wrap up, I have had a pretty bad relationship with, with puzzle games and adventure games and I've played a handful of them.
But generally I've, I've come away from them feeling pretty frustrated.
1:39:27
And this game has taken the puzzle game formula and, and solved the main problem which we discussed earlier, Colin brought up earlier.
The worst part of the puzzle is not being able to solve the puzzle, which is is is is sort of ironic.
And the fact that this is run based and that not all the puzzles are 100% required and that you have time to think about and you know, you don't have to address every puzzle as soon as you you reach it is is a real triumph.
1:39:55
And the fact that this game leverages rogue like mechanics so cleverly, so interesting.
I think this is a real triumph of rogue like game design.
So again my new number ten 7.9 points.
1:40:11
All right, I'll bring up the caboose for this.
I'm going to give it a 5 out of 10.
I thought the gunplay was terrible.
The enemy variety was just non existent.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm giving it an 8.
I think I summarized it in my early score.
1:40:32
I think this is a game that most, if not everyone should try.
I think it's a really innovative game.
I think it's very interesting to think about, to talk about.
It's very like I enjoyed talking about it with the podcast Co host and I'm looking forward to talking about it with other people who have played it now.
1:40:54
I think they were I've had some some frustration in the last day or two playing it just because I feel so close to beating it and I got weird or bad RNG.
Or maybe maybe I just haven't uncovered the apple orchard and that maybe maybe I've been trying to push to finish it too early rather than unlock the meta progression stuff.
1:41:17
But like overall it's still a very good game.
So it's got a lot of like stuff that I'm I'm excited to see what comes from this.
Like these feel like ideas that other people are going to draw on as well.
1:41:33
So I'm excited to see what games come after this.
Using this as some inspiration, like the the puzzle building room building aspect feels like it feels like a board game in some ways it feels like some other kind of like solitaire type games, but I'm excited for it.
1:41:51
And the game itself is really good.
It's quite pretty.
It's got a lot of good puzzles.
I like reading stuff in games, so that didn't bother me at all.
I thought that like some of the stuff was quite well done.
Music wasn't anything to write home about, but overall a very solid game.
1:42:10
People should play it.
Right, I think time to to do a very quick similar games segment again, the a very Christ, what do I put in for the similar games segment?
Just puzzle games, yeah, not robot games at all.
There is there is because this game is so unique and this is this is another classic case of like, I don't know, I guess I'll put this one in here.
1:42:32
So there's a lot of question marks around some of these.
The top one I think is inscription just because of like the puzzle game nature aspects to it and a lot of like unexpected twists and turns.
A couple games in here that I think are actually kind of similar in different ways.
1:42:51
There's a game called lost for for swords, like like the pun lost for words, but lost for swords.
Swords that like you are, you are drafting cards and you are using those to like build out the layout for a dungeon that you're running around, which does feel very blueprints coded.
1:43:10
Similarly, there's a game that recently came out called Drop Dutchie, which is is more of kind of, I guess, like a Tetris format.
I played the demo for that.
Yeah, and and Colin, correct me if I'm wrong, but like you know, you are, you're like dropping rooms in down from the top and then doing stuff with them and.
1:43:28
It's like Tetris ish.
Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for that game to come out into like a real release.
It looks like it'll be cool too.
Related Colin to your Neil Patrick Harris.
Like weird board game puzzle thing.
1:43:43
There's a game called the Devil's Calculator, which is it feels like that would fit right at home is like a a blueprints puzzle here where it's like it's, it's just like a calculator UI and like you're just entering numbers in on it.
But it's like has like this like weirdly deep puzzle system to it, which is kind of strange, but like scarily curious.
1:44:04
There is a, a platformer puzzler called Mosalina that I think is very relevant here in that like it says upfront, like, hey, a lot of these things like aren't solvable.
And that's OK because it's just procedural, like random mayhem.
But it's another great game to play on the couch with like a second person where you're like the conceit.
1:44:23
There is like the you have like some random like puzzle of like platformers that you have to get from point A to point B and you're shooting mushrooms and bouncing off of things and deleting objects.
And it's all sorts of bizarre, wacky fun.
It it feels very blue princey in the sense of like, yeah, like it's you're not going to win it every time.
1:44:42
But the fun is not in winning it.
The fun is just like seeing all the wag weird stuff that happens.
There's another couple ones on here that I have question marks on.
Maybe I think Curse of the Golden Idol.
I don't know if that's really rogue per SE, but certainly fits the kind of puzzle nature.
1:44:57
And then I think the dead seat.
Why do I have that on here?
It's probably a good reason for it.
Give it a look.
The dead seat.
Why not?
And then like real, real quick, some non rogue puzzle games that are very blueprintsy Outer Wilds I talked about a lot.
Return of the Oberman, 100% the Forgotten City.
1:45:15
You should probably check out if you're fans of either of those.
You may have heard of this Majora's Mask game.
I don't know, maybe who knows.
And then one that has, I think some pretty decent buzz, but I think came out fairly recently called, I'm guessing you pronounce this IGTAIJI feels like another very kind of like missed sort of like esoteric weird, cool puzzle game with lots, lots of deep interacting systems to it.
1:45:44
So give those a look pause, go back, listen, listen in on all those names that I random rattled off super fast.
And as we super fastly wind down here, because I know Colin is is itching to fire up those Nexus mods and get back into blueprints and finally see that ending.
1:46:04
I know you're.
Going to make another joke about him being late for dinner.
He's hungry.
I was hungry for victory.
No, I already.
Ate before the pod because I've I've wised up you.
Had your your rank 8 Turkey dinner already?
There's a slice of pizza.
Yeah, well, if you want to see all of all of my wacky blueprints related ship posting Grogpod at game dev dot place is the Mastodon where I have all sorts of pictures of Agent K from Blade Runner screaming at the at the wrong wrongly chosen puzzle box, which was my experience just about every time among other fun things in there too.
1:46:42
So so feel free to give that a look.
Grogpodzone@gmail.com right in if you want to be like Davian our our super cool writer inner even though I truncated most of the e-mail.
Hey Davian, thanks again for writing in.
Appreciate it.
I'll tell you this, if I was playing, if I was in a mysterious mansion and I found a note on a table and it was from you, I would absolutely read it.
1:47:05
I would not just screenshot it and forget about it forever.
So thanks for writing in.
And then finally, Grogpod dot Zone is where we have all the stuff, all their previous episodes, more show notes, things, rankings I've been putting together.
I guess there's like on the GitHub that I host the page on, there's like a wiki function that I've been using to do some fun stuff with dev interviews, all sorts of fun things on there.
1:47:28
So go and give that a a look, Grogpod dot dot zone.
And that's gonna, yeah, I guess I should have said this before.
That'll wrap up our new number 11 out of 73 ranked blueprints.
1:47:44
So high praise doesn't doesn't happen often that we get a an almost top tenner here as as almost top ten as you can get.
But, but as we wrap up our new number 11 blueprints, we have a, a new game on the horizon, assuming this latest spider doesn't come out on Friday, which, you know, we, we may have to take another look at the scheduler.
1:48:05
But tentatively at the moment, we, we've done a lot of book reading and it it for, for this, for this game.
Andrew what?
What the?
What do you have queued up for us on our next episode here?
Yeah, well, Speaking of writing in, you can't do much writing without a pen and paper and the necessary supplies.
1:48:24
We're going to be covering the cooperative third person shooter, maybe Vellum.
Yeah, I think it's like risk of Rain too, maybe.
It looks like it.
A ton about it honestly, but it comes highly recommended, so I'm sure it's sure to be a good time and hopefully we'll get some cooperative time in.
1:48:46
But if not, hey, hopefully the game stands on its own as a single player experience as well.
I'm sure it will.
I'm confident it's finally time for the libraries to fight back.
So we're we're giving the chance for the books to to come off the shelves and and you know, do throw themselves at you and whatever else we expect out of out of vellum VELLUM for our next episode.
1:49:10
But that's going to do it for for blueprints and playing us out here some how about some tomb tunes to play it safe or maybe 8 safes question.
