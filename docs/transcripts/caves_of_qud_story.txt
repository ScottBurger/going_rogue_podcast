Moon and Sun friends and welcome to a special two-part episode on Caves of Qud.
This part will be a very spoilery deep dive into the story as guided by the amazing soundtrack by Craig Hamilton, the composer of this game.
It doesn't spoil everything, just the main quest up to a certain point.
0:22
The final, final piece of the story will leave you to experience yourself, just as long as you don't look at the wiki too much.
Part 2 of this Standard Grog Pot or Part 2 of this will be a standard Grog Pot episode where we'll focus more on the gameplay mechanics and Caves of Qud, but I felt that the the story was important enough to have a detailed focus for.
0:42
It did win a Hugo Award after all.
So if you want to have minimal story spoilers, our next episode will be more up your alley on our regular publishing schedule.
And so, without further ado, we begin our journey with the soundtrack and story from Caves of Qud.
2:51
That is pilgrim's path by the composer to caves of Qud Craig Hamilton lead, kicking us off here with all sorts of thematic tone that I think is really going to help set the stage for for what's to come here.
3:09
But but yes, welcome to to a story in soundtrack focus episode.
I am your robotic DJ host of of this special 2 parter Scott Burger and with me are my usual beguiled Co hosts.
3:27
It's Colin.
I I'm not sure if we're doing things for this one.
So I I'm just a regular guy listening to some music today.
There we go.
Oh, but, but I'm Andrew Qudman, harsh man, here at your service and with us.
3:44
Scott, what do?
What do we have in store?
Yes, we we have a special guest joining us, someone who's very patient in helping to tutor me on how to learn learn to play Caves of Qud almost a whole year ago.
So with without further any further ado to ask our special guest here to give maybe the the least humble introduction that they can to.
4:09
Least humble.
Oh, geez.
OK, hi.
I'm a big simple on YouTube, but you can call me Aaron or you can call me Bingo is actually my online alias these days, which is pretty fun.
4:26
There's a bastardization of one of my friends gave to my branding, which I thought was very fun.
But yeah, no, I I play Caves of Qud.
That is the least humble thing I can say about myself.
And I did some tutorials once.
4:42
And you've been playing it for a long time.
You've been playing it long before the One Point O release last year for sure.
I've been playing it for five years, which is actually pretty late in the game considering Caves of Cut has been in development for about 17 years.
4:57
And I don't even have a icebergs worth like tip of icebergs worth of hours compared to some of the people on the discord or certainly not as much as some of my friends.
And or the devs but I I have a least humbles amount of time in caves of Qud.
5:17
Well, you, you at least played with the devs and some other people who contributed to the game much more than than any of us loudmouth.
Podcast impressive, can say yeah, finally, we have to.
Say I've contributed.
That's great.
I'm just glad that we we finally have someone who seems to actually like roguelike games on the podcast.
5:40
We finally have someone who's who's qualified.
So thank you for coming on.
No worries, you might be surprised at the reveal of that last statement though I've I've had some interesting relationship stuff with traditional rogue lakes in general.
5:57
Well, I think part of the goal for this two parter is is to help set the stage.
Caves of Cut is a, is a brutal and long game where I think a lot of people can, can easily bounce off of it.
And I think part of the, the motivation here is to showcase what's in store for you if you stick with it and why this game is so well received as it is.
6:21
I think just a few days ago, I think PC Gamer just listed this as its top, what was it #7 of its top 100 games of 2025 or something like that.
So there's, there's a reason why.
And I think if you, if you're 1 of many people who goes through the game, you're just like, if you're like me when you were first playing it without a tutor and you were like, what is this?
6:45
This is inscrutable nonsense.
And you didn't quite know the epic that was about to unfold before you, you, you could be forgiven for sure.
So that's part of the goal here is if you have no interest in actually playing the game, maybe you can listen to this and be like, OK, maybe I can.
7:02
I can get what people are so hyped up about.
But.
As as an artistic endeavor, music story, etcetera.
The whole package, something that you don't find from Net Hacker Ink Band, unfortunately.
So we will, yeah, I guess we'll be going through part most of the soundtrack, most of the main story quest here to kind of help unfurl and untangle some of that.
7:26
And this first track that we're greeted with, Pilgrim's Path is kind of a such a a good stage setter for this.
I think it just has such good like Moody, weird, like alienness to it with like the like very low bass buzzing and these these like hushed whispers.
7:46
I wrote what I have in here, my Google Doc notes Cyberpunk Vangelis is what I have written down, which I think yeah, the IT would fits the theme of kind of what we're going for here and.
It is actually extremely apartment.
And forget a little noises in the background.
8:07
Yeah, I have to assume it's some like mushroom creature communicating to its friends or strap.
In yeah and I think like this title screen just looks great I think it it really sets a sense of wonder and like there's these little yellow engraving and carving things that that just show up right in front of your face that are no that's that's a neat detail.
8:33
But as you play through the game, you're like, oh, wow, OK.
Like it's just right up in front of your face of like, there's so many good callbacks.
There's so many good like story setup sequences throughout this that I'm hoping, I'm hoping I can do justice with my 38 pages of Google Doc notes here.
8:52
So I didn't quite copy the entire wiki in, but I did most of it.
But but yeah, as as we start our pilgrims path here with Caves of Qud, we'll launch into our next piece of music here for Memet's Morning by Craig.
9:10
I just wanted to mention for for the pilgrims path, it's worth mentioning, I think that in in addition to being an introduction to the soundtrack, that that track plays while you're setting up your game.
And it's long enough that you can be throwing together your your mutant or your Trukin or whatever you want.
9:32
That you you would probably be done making your character and setting your starting point in the in the world that you would have gotten through most of that track.
And I think that's it's really interesting to do something like that because it's it's not just an introduction to the soundtrack.
9:50
It's an introduction it it's sort of like also ambient as you're setting up your character.
So it's it, it's kind of a dual function there a little bit.
Yeah.
It's.
Definitely more than the title screen music on.
You know, if you're playing other games, you're like, I'm clicking through as fast as I can just to get into my game.
10:08
Versus yeah, you could spend, especially if you're a new player like most of us are, you could spend a lot of time looking through the option.
So I've definitely heard this song multiple times the last week just because I've been like, I'm going to look through all of the options of what, even if I don't think I'm going to use them, like I want to know what hook feet are.
10:30
Those burrowing claws?
Well, yeah.
Depending on your character creation, one option that you might have is to start in in the village of Jopa, which I think is recommended for for new players.
It's kind of like a a good starting village to start with.
10:48
And our next track, Mem It's Morning is is the audio that greets you once you arrive.
So up next will be Mem.
It's Morning by our composer Craig Hamilton.
11:42
None.
12:16
Music.
13:04
You're listening to Mehmets Morning by our composer Craig Hamilton.
And this is the music, the background music that greets you as you come to the non procedurally generated starting village of Jopa.
And you're greeted with a a very easily skippable dialogue box that pops up that I but I think is helpful to to stop and just kind of take notice of that pops up and says on the 12th of some random caves of Quddate.
13:33
You arrive at the Oasis hamlet of Jopa along the far rim of the mug Rahi, the great salt desert.
All around you, moisture farmers tend to Groves of viridian water vine.
There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestock on the horizon.
13:51
Quds jungles strangle Chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth further and beyond the fables, the fabled spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud ribboned sky, which I think is is just the best way to kind of set the stage for what's ahead of us here with extremely flowery writing and something that you could also easily skip in two seconds that you're like wait.
14:21
But I think the first time that I played this game, I was like, what am I supposed to do?
What what it's there's all this kind of stuff in front of me.
But I think it's worth pointing out that like the like that message packs so much into it without really realizing and that the starting village also has kind of the whole game almost in a nutshell narrative wise for at least for starting bread crumbs.
14:50
You you'll inevitably press 0 on your keypad to auto explore this village and just be like, all right, just give me everything that you got and you'll encounter a a shrine to Raycheff, the last Sultan, which is described as this shrine depicts a significant event from the life of the ancient Sultan Raycheff in three AR Reshef cleaned the marshlands of the plagues of the gyre and taught Abraham to sow water vine along its fertile tracks.
15:21
Yeah, that's great.
They got a neat little shrine to someone awesome.
You'll run around and you'll encounter some village elders who will send you on quests and the village tinkerer and basically every every every starting location that you'll begin in this game has that kind of thing.
15:38
It has specifically a shrine to Reshef.
It has I think we can also talk about the bread crumbs to the other sultans, but it has a village tinkerer who has like mechanical equipment for you to do or to to look through some kind of village elder with a a quest.
15:58
But in this case, they're very specific.
They are things that are, are driving this main narrative force here in Jopa.
If you maybe talk to a elder Erudad first, he'll send you on a quest of, you know, all this water vine stuff that we're farming here is being eaten by these by these pests.
16:21
Go and go and figure out what what's eating the water vine here.
And, and in this quest, it will send you N out of your starting village to I believe Red Rock, which is kind of like an introductory dungeon.
You'll go and do stuff there and you'll eventually find some some purple looking alien creature that really just looks super out of place for this area that you've you're just barely getting to grips with You'll.
16:49
You'll does it look out of place?
You know, that's a great.
Question.
Feel like there's nothing that's out, quite out of place.
It's worth noting that Memet's actually the one that gives you that quest, yes, Which is what the the track is named after, right?
Yes, that's true.
17:04
Yes.
And but you're, I believe you're instructed to bring it back to to elder.
You have to.
You have to bring it back to your dad.
And by doing so, you, you plop this corpse on the table in front of him.
And he says, oh, what's what's this?
A warted leg?
Foul smell of sour gum, Moon and sun.
17:24
This is a Gershling and and your player character's just like what what what are you talking about?
What what is any of this?
And he he goes on to say it's a creature of plague.
This one covered in slick and muscled out the bilge hose of sleeping Algol got under The Cave of the cloaca indubitably, but here, gushling this far West, there must be hundreds for one to reach.
17:52
Does the gyre widen again?
Plagues of our great grand sires many times over.
Salt, darkness, Svardim, Frog, Gershling.
Which I think helps to also kind of set the the tone of, well, this ancient person that the statue was erected to.
18:12
Yeah.
Well, obviously should have known, you know, based on the Sultan statue, you know, Chekhov's Sultan statue, that obviously that information was going to come up immediately.
My word.
But the it's back, the the the plagues of the gyre are back and something, something's got to happen to it.
18:34
And so you you're going to elder ear.
Dad is pretty alarmed by this, but you'll be talking to some other NPCS in the in in town and Argive.
The village tinker, who I I feel like doesn't doesn't really like you at all, sends you on a couple fetch quests, one of which to to go and like all good hermits of villages, go and strip copper wire out of places for him.
19:00
Says what was it?
The weird wire conduit is near assembled, and once it is we'll be able to chat with anyone in instant time.
He's trying to build a zoom chat here from here to the Yeed freehold.
But before I can finish I need wire as much as you can find.
19:17
At least 200 feet.
Should be able to scavenge scavenge it from the rust wells and I'm skipping over a lot here, but you go in you go and do that in air quotes.
You come back and you say all right, just slap it on the table.
Here's your here's your damn wire argive.
19:32
Thanks a lot.
He says apprentice come here.
Something strange is occurring.
The conduit is picking up a signal some sort of repeating transmission.
I cannot decipher it.
However, I lacked I lack crypto goal eggs and well, never you mind.
I have a great task for you, my apprentice.
19:48
Do you accept it?
And of course you say yes, you must.
He says you must seek out Barathrum the old, the eldest and wisest tinker alive.
He lives with his followers at the with the Barathrumites under the arch of Grip gate to the northeast and the jungle strangled ruins of Qud.
20:08
He will know what to make of this signal.
And you say who?
Who's this Barathrum?
The Brathrumites.
They're disciples of Barathrum, mostly Urshib bear, albino bear people.
But like their mentor quilled albino bears who prefer their candle dim caves to the sun's salted surface of the jungle, 1000 years ago, Barathrim and his kin crossed the home's delta into the rusting heart of Qud.
20:37
He spent centuries peeling the Chrome shells of Times artifacts in his workshop.
If he cannot decipher the signal, no one can.
So question for Scott and Aaron, is this this quest, this is the main quest then are there the the main quest, the.
20:59
The like the.
Basically like the intro quest.
Yeah, this is.
This puts you on the path.
Are there other hooks into this kind of quest line if you starting from other villages?
So that's that.
Is interesting I think the only way you could potentially no there there's no other hooks and other procedurally generated villages to get on this path.
21:24
But I think that if you went to Greek gate early without talking to Argive, you could maybe convene with them early and then they might hear you out.
But I actually, I actually feel like that's not true.
And and it feels like something I should try myself is like, go and talk to them without talking to R guy.
21:43
But he gives you the the significant quest item to hand to them and that kind of brokers pass passage.
Otherwise they just tell you to get lost.
Well, well, there's there's.
He gives you a a stamped data disk and a Droid scramble scrambler, which will come in handy because grit Gate is protected by a bunch of protective droids.
22:08
But I think like if you start in other villages and you do, you do quests like you can get that data disk.
It just doesn't have that kind of story hook to it.
They're just like, hey, here, this here's this disk.
We don't know what to do with it.
Go take it to the Barathromites kind of deal.
Yeah, so, well, the the starting quests are going to be different, but then they'll like send you on the same path, but you won't have the same kind of context that our guys gives you Jopa.
22:32
Jopa gives you I I consider Jopa to be like the canonical story of of Qud, but that's dangerous thinking.
You can't think like that with there's no Canon.
There is and there isn't at least, but I'll get.
It right out of my head.
Yeah, yeah, and the the Droid scrambler you can still obtain, but you have to go to like the ruins of Jopa if you start in a procedurally generated village.
22:56
Now now on the topic of Canon, we've we've got represented on the podcast here all stages of Qud experience.
I haven't booted the game at all and based on the soundtrack, I'm assuming that this is some kind of a cozy village management game.
23:17
So but real quickly, what's the what's the like one paragraph setting here?
Is this is this post apocalyptic?
Is this pre apocalyptic?
Yes.
What?
What do we have going on here?
And of course, sci-fi fantasy of some caliber.
23:34
Yeah, I mean, yes to all of that.
Everything, all, everything.
All.
All.
Of the above.
It's, it's, it's post, post, post post apocalyptic and it's pre apocalypse and then it's also pre post apocalyptic.
23:50
It's, it's everything and, and it's like, you know, interpretive.
Right, because of course we had the the the Plague Gyre that was referenced in the lore and then and then we're sort of in the middle age and then apparently it's it has returned.
24:06
What a deal, What a deal.
Yeah.
And I think a, a, a good corollary for this is the tabletop RPG Gamma World, which is like what if D&D but mutants, cyborgs and and mental warriors kind of a deal.
24:24
And that's sort of the the thematic setting that this game is in certainly from like the character creation perspective for sure.
And I think like actual like narrative arc wise.
24:41
So normally at the end of each one of these episodes, they do like a similar games segment, but I was for this one, I have like a similar sci-fi story segment instead, which we'll get to.
But there is there is a number of them that I think do fit fairly well with like, yeah, like post apocalyptic rebuilding, the world is destroyed, everyone's a weird mutant kind of a thing.
25:02
So.
I don't know the there's a book series called the book of the new sun.
It's very much reminds me like conceptually of this where it's like this world is so far into the post apocalypse that it's pre apocalypse and it like it's it's all the things in between book of the New sun.
25:25
They're like scrabbling by like the last city in the world because everything else has been turned into like radioactive jungle.
And then sometimes, you know, aliens, or maybe they're not even aliens.
Maybe they're just post humans like pop down in their spaceships and like do stuff.
25:41
And that's I kind of get the same vibe from this, where it's like your post apocalyptic is not even quite the right word because there have been so many eras of things happening.
Yeah, I know that book of the New Sun, it has a big hand of influence over Caves of Qud and the writing and it's it's one of many influences, but I know that it is one of one of those the the sort of the the end appendix, if you will, for for Qud.
26:09
All right.
We are.
We're on our quest.
We have our our dated disk, potentially A Droid scrambler if we if we are so prepared.
We're now ready to to venture forth into the jungles, the head towards Grit Gate, and our next music to play here will be Overworld by our composer Craig Hamilton.
28:28
You were listening it to Overworld from the Caves of Qud soundtrack, specifically about two minutes 2 1/2 minutes through this 10 minute long track.
Because there's, there's quite a lot going on here and I can't think of a better piece of music to signify that you are in a weird mutated alien landscape than stuff with goat bleeding people shouting weird mechanical prayers through loud speakers and rhinoceros snorts.
29:05
Welcome to caves of God I I feel like this music is just kind of perfect for like how you traverse through the overworld of this game.
It feels, it feels hostile, it feels weird, uncomfortable.
29:24
It almost feels like out of something like like the sci-fi movie Arrival or either like Arrival Annihilation or like the HBO series of like Chernobyl.
Oh hell yeah, I.
Feel like you're getting different vibes from this for me, like I, I, I don't feel like this was quite as hostile as your, you know, I'm, I'm imagining like a weird dude in a, a, a salt marsh and there's this, this friendly rhino next to him making weird grunting noises like the sun, the sun is rising.
29:56
There's weird dragonflies that are the size of horses flying around me, but it's a, you know, a peaceful.
Farmer I guess the beauty of this game is that both can be true based on your experiences of trying to get to grid gate.
Yeah, the track takes a more sinister tone when you're being chased by a crocodile.
30:14
Fair.
Fair.
Yeah, it really, you know it.
Whatever you want that that weird grunting noise to be.
Could be more or less hostile.
But this is the music that, well, one of one of many tracks that greets you is you're running around the surface of this game, which the surface is big.
30:33
Maybe we'll talk about the caves being big in a minute or possibly on the next episode.
But this is where you're running through procedurally generated ruins, layers to legendary creatures.
You're getting lost through these dense and and claustrophobic jungles.
30:52
You are you're going through these areas that are filled with like rusted vines that will reach out and and grab and rust your equipment.
But eventually, against all odds, you will will make it to to grit Gate and you will you'll delve a whopping 3 levels deep, which is nothing in this game, as we'll we'll come to see to get to the the headquarters of the Barathromites, which similarly, I feel like a lot of MPCS in this game have a very ambivalent attitude towards you.
31:25
As you you walk up, you are greeted by something that akin to like McDonald's, like voice transmitter.
The communications panel that you go up to it, it says a voice transmitting through the panel be gone.
31:41
Wayfarer, this is no place for you.
And you say, wait, wait, wait.
My name is listener.
I bring a message from archive of Jopa and then a a slot opens from the center of the door in a metal tray slides out, after which you put you hand over your your disk with the with the signal that archive has encoded on there.
32:03
And the the message says the disk is encoded with an important signal to discuss it further, we must admit you to our order.
Unfortunately, we require more than a willing spirit.
You will need to prove your worth, that you might not waste our time and effort.
32:20
Travel to the great cavern Golgotha, or Golgotha to the north.
Within its halls you will find a cache of dysfunctional wage droids.
Repair one or recover one.
Repair it and return here.
We are satisfied with your work.
You will be admitted as an apprentice.
32:36
Otherwise you will be turned away.
Do you accept this arrangement?
This is my typical experience at the Dr. thru pharmacy every time.
Like yo come on I'm just here for a script.
It's pretty typical stuff.
Then they send me to go collect, you know, some kind of AI from a cave somewhere.
32:55
Love a good quest as as someone who again, very limited experience with this game.
Hey, that that sounds engaging, that sounds interesting.
If I was playing, you know, tabletop game and this was the quest I was given, I would be, I would be intrigued and excited to, you know, kind of building the excitement of of gaining entry, eventually gaining entry into this, you know, the secretive order or what have you.
33:20
And so like typically, how many hours just on average, I mean, would one expect to be into the game at this point?
That's up to you.
It's up to you. 100% that's up to you, and that is that is true throughout caves of code.
33:36
Yeah, and, and, and I think I believe it in the vein of other massive open world games like The Witcher 3, Skyrim to some extent.
Balder's Gate, you know, it's, it's very easy to get.
Like we're, we're not covering any of the side quests in this, in this thing.
33:53
And there's there's a lot of them like just in the the little SEC, like first third of the of the overworld map that you're trundling around in just to get to the the grit gate area.
There's a, a handful of very interesting and very unique kind of side quests that can take like dozens of hours to do.
34:18
And you know, you'd be like, oh, but I wait, what's this thing over there?
And like getting very easily distracted by by stuff.
Like there's some like there's this deceptive amount of stuff in here that the first time that I was playing it, I was like, where is everything?
There's they feel so like barren and empty, but the more that you kind of just go and explore and just kind of get distracted by stuff, you'll see it just the kind of unfurls and ahead of you and you're just like, wait, what was I supposed to be doing again?
34:49
Well, like every little village has the same also has the same starting quest to go to the six silt Desert city 6.
Days stilt.
Yeah, that's the one.
So like there are other hooks to do stuff like my I I.
35:06
So I'll, I'll give you the end of like 5:00-ish hours I've played so far.
I kind of had assumed that that was the main the, the the the hook into the main quest because it appears in multiple villages.
So I I figured that there's something there that is important to World Story and there probably.
35:24
Is.
Yeah, there's, I mean, yeah, there, there's there's not enough time in this podcast to get into to all that, but maybe in part 9 we'll get to the Argent Fathers and all of the the librarian of the six days still being a a different character every time.
35:42
But anyway, yeah, your, your adventure has begun and lots of stuff to like to to go through.
And so our our next quest here going to the, the dungeon fortress of Golgotha.
I don't know why I keep saying Golgotha.
35:58
It's Golgotha, I think, but there's no hard and fast rules about pronunciation here, I guess.
I think, I think this is the the task that I have given my Co host two weeks to complete.
If in two weeks you can maybe at least get to even this point, you'll be ahead of the curve of a good chunk of other folks, at least according to what the caves of cuts subreddit has instructed me to do.
36:22
So they they gave they gave me a a communications panel to send my Co host on this death defying quest to go to go to where our next track is taking us.
How hard can it be?
How hard can it be?
36:38
And I guess I, I kind of smiled at the fact that like, oh, you have to go and rescue this, this, this Droid from this dungeon that we'll be encountering next.
There's a lot of droids at this place already.
How many adventurers died bringing all these damn droids to Grit Gate that haven't been accepted to the order?
36:59
But anyway.
And never made that connection.
That's actually amazing.
Also I I'm not sure so Golgotha is a like literal thing though.
Golgotha is the where Jesus was crucified.
Yeah.
And there is a there is a correct pronunciation for it.
37:15
Maybe one of the few words that does have like a.
Probably you pronounce it this way.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there is.
This game also has a interesting amount of like biblical Aramaic and like Sumerian references in it that are not unimportant.
37:34
Like you could have just picked any word to throw in there, but I think there's some things that we'll be, we'll be encountering later on that it's like, Oh yeah, you could have called it anything, but calling it that there's a specific reason for it, so.
The the Golgotha is the aromatic name for the place of the skull.
37:52
I feel like there's probably some significance to that.
Yeah, as we'll find out with this, with this track, let's let's let's jump into it.
Let's get waist deep in some wastewater.
Our next track here is I'm gonna say Golgotha or Gol, whatever it.
38:10
Is it's the place of the skull?
Yeah, it is.
It is a place like pronunciation.
Golgotha.
God.
Golgotha, our next track.
39:22
None.
39:47
We're listening to the Nightmare Fuel soundtrack that is Golgotha from Caves of Qud.
This is maybe your first proper Capital D dungeon in this game, which is still only about 5 floors deep, but is just, oh, quite the thematic goopy.
40:13
What do I have written down in my notes here?
What if Factorial was a horror game in a Dark Souls poison swamp Biome is kind of the vibe that I got from this.
Well, I'm sold.
What a deal.
And it occurs to me that, you know, hey, in a in a genre where sometimes the graphics, traditional roguelike are, are so, you know, abstract and in some ways limited, it's all the more important to have an an evocative soundtrack and an atmospheric suite of sounds, a soundscape to further sort of inform and and and buttress what you know, information is being conveyed visually.
41:00
You can convey so much, you know, from an audible.
And I can only imagine what what a wild journey it must have been for the composer to source all of these wonderful robot and you know, bubbling acid swamps sound effects.
41:19
Well, notably about Golgotha's conveyor belts.
This is a for for a turn based game.
There are conveyor belts that as you move will move you extra spaces, which, oh, that doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, what there's what did you say that there are giant flamethrower vents and acid vents and things that shoot electricity out of them.
41:43
Not to mention like slimes and quill PEDs and giant beetles, electric snails, all sorts of great stuff in effectively what I believe canonically, this place is supposed to be a a garbage processing center of sorts to which you are tasked with jumping down a garbage chute, braving all of these waste processing mechanisms, and getting dumped into the cloaca.
42:18
A great name for a for a garbage dump where you depend, you know, depending on your reputation with the mollusks faction, you could be encountering a friendly or hostile giant mollusk named Slog of the Cloaca who inhabits down here.
42:39
And, you know, there, there's a bunch of scrapped waderoids that you can pick up and be like, OK, get me the hell out of here.
And you can take the the central elevator back up to the surface as fast as you possibly can.
Get out of there before contracting one of the many fun diseases in this game that will cause the tongue to rot out of your mouth.
43:02
Yeah, I think this this one was was kind of a turning point for me in the in the game where before this in in Aaron and I did a a very lengthy tutorial series on going very excruciatingly in depth on what are all of these UI elements?
43:18
What are what is this like?
How does this game work on like a fundamental level, which was super great.
A link to it in the show notes.
We didn't get anywhere close to this in terms of progression.
And that was over the course of like 8 hours or so.
This is the point where I felt like, whoa, OK, the game is like really a lot deeper than I thought it was.
43:39
And in this case like only 5 levels deep.
There's just, there's so much atmosphere and so much uniqueness to this opening up that really kind of sets the stage for what's to come of like this is this is not a, a standard traditional rogue like in any sense.
43:59
This is like something that presents itself as a traditional rogue like in terms of interface and interactability, but it's scope and scale and uniqueness and variety is just so beyond the pale that it is not just jumping in through a fantasy D&D reskin and having to worry about your hunger levels and starving to death.
44:22
I'm having to worry about my tongue rotting out of my throat.
Yeah, you, you don't really realize how much the game is actually holding your hand until you get to Golgotha.
It it, it takes the guardrails off.
It it sort of finally takes the guardrails off.
44:39
It takes the the rockley, the like bags off the legs.
And it's like, OK, bud.
That's that's concerning for me, playing me like I, I'm like dying so quickly.
Like, hey man, you're still playing with the gutter guards on.
Yeah, well, if you, if you have lots of collected honey in your water skins or yuck wheat stems for disease prevention or, or if you've prepared recipes, or if you have any kind of recipes that you've learned from various villages or through creatures, you can, you can get things to help kind of prevent the the awful effects of stepping into black ooze or being attacked by sewage eels or spitting slugs.
45:27
And you know, you can keep your, your tongue nice and safe in your in your mouth.
It can regrow back.
Don't worry about it, but but yeah, this is this is kind of like the the first real test of the game for many players of like, can you, can you get this far?
45:44
Can you get to the Barathromites?
Can you get to this awful garbage dump and can you get out and and come back?
And so I think this is this is where it kind of leads us into our next track here and really kind of like, oh, you know, thank God, we've gone through the the nightmare fuel of all these icky caves and conveyor belts.
46:12
We've returned to Grit gate.
We return to grit Gate with our Wadroid and we have been accepted into the order.
So up next, we're going to play the next piece in our soundtrack called Stoic Porridge from the Caves of Qud soundtrack.
47:16
Music.
47:37
The.
48:11
You're listening to the relatively peaceful and calming soundtrack of stoic porridge from Caves of Qud.
This is the the music that plays when you've reached and been accepted to the Order of Grit Gate and the Barathromites.
48:29
So.
This plays in grit gate instead of whatever the previous track was.
Well, the previous one was the the nightmare garbage dump.
Just I mean, but you had been at Grik Gate before by this point.
Right, Yeah, technically I guess this this does play when you first arrive.
48:45
But this is also like a more comforting.
Well, yeah, it it plays.
As soon as you enter the screen.
So even if you're outside of Grik Gate you you'll hear this track.
Do you know that you've done good?
Because it's not foreboding.
True.
49:01
Yeah, Yeah, there's no conveyor belt inserter sounds going on.
Yeah.
And this, this feels like such a cozy respite compared to what you had just gone through, particularly because this feels like your your main, like starting base for a good chunk of the game, at least for maybe like the the first half.
49:27
You come back and throw slap the way Droid into the slot and you are you're beckoned to come through the the force field and you are greeted by Otho who says, welcome to great Gate.
I am Otho Barathram Steward.
49:43
I apologize for the manner of our introduction, but we must take precaution.
Cut is a very unforgiving place.
And you are rewarded with some quest, some quest goodies like, hey, you know, take, take some of this stuff.
And, and you know, he wants to discuss the signal that you've captured earlier from with, with our guy.
50:03
And he says the signal is a repeat transmission being broadcast from an unknown source.
One of our tinkers, Q girl discovered it while rigging a long wave detector.
Unfortunately, it's encrypted and we do not have the means here to decrypt it.
You may be of some help in this manner, however.
50:20
We've known, we've long known the location of a fully functioning batal within the bowels of the Great Hall Bethesda Souza.
The Mechanimus have consecrated the side around it and built a temple there.
Q girl claims to have developed a means to decrypt the signal, but she needs the computing power of the batal.
50:39
If you can infiltrate the Mechanimus compound, you may be able to engage the batal and decode the signal.
And your player character has a very apartment response of batal.
What question mark and otho goes on to say they are antique stones located in certain places deep within the caverns of Qud.
50:57
We believe they are some sort of hyper advanced machine built by the eaters, the capital E These are this is the civilization long long dead as you've arrived here that all the previous sultans have reigned over.
51:13
But I think this is maybe our first actual introduction to them.
Otho goes on to say often one claims to possess a sentience of its own.
These battles, however, most of them have gone haywire in the Eon since their creation.
It is rare indeed to discover one whose circuitry is wholly uncorroded.
51:31
The Mecanimus worship this one as an idol, and they will protect it at all costs.
You will need to find a way through their host to the batal itself.
Do you believe you can accomplish this task?
And of course you say yes.
And then he says, good apprentice, Speak to Q girl in the workshop.
51:46
She'll encode her instructions for the batal onto a copy of the disk.
There's one more thing.
The battle is located beneath the ancient cryo barrios of the Eaters.
Time has worked to erode the mechanisms that contain their cryogenic mist.
That freezing vapor billows out of the chambers freely now, cooling the entire cavern.
52:07
You'll want to procure some warm clothing to protect yourself.
The spoils of the Mechanimus are yours to keep.
Remember, Apprentice Barath Room will look kindly upon your service.
This is.
Yes, the the the cryo dungeon of Bethesda Souza you are you're giving ample warning that hey, well, you've gone through the garbage dungeon.
52:32
How about the the ice dungeon that awaits you next?
I kind of wish Otha would have given us a little more heads up about some of the monsters that inhabit Bethesda Souza, but really, there's only so much you could that can prepare you in the world of Qud for what sort of horrific things await you.
52:53
But.
Luckily we have Scott and Big Simple to to give us those warnings instead.
You you want me, I should just give you the answers then I'll just like hand over the keys.
I mean, no, no, no, I, I there, there are, there are ways to choose just about every dungeon and short change them.
53:16
And I have done that.
And there are definitely ways to make things easier on yourself.
And I think Bethesda Sousa is maybe the first dungeon that teaches you hard lessons in that regard, that if you do not consider all of your resources, not just the physical ones, then you are gonna have a hard time, bud.
53:39
And it it definitely slaps your hand a little bit.
Maybe more so than Golgotha.
I actually consider Bethesda Sousa.
IMO is is maybe the hardest dungeon in the game.
Yeah, I think I would cosign on that as well just because like as you progress, and we'll probably talk more about this in our follow up episode on like the specific gameplay mechanics and like the design of like how how you're supposed to use all these tools at your disposal.
54:08
But this is one that really kind of makes like it's it's that standard RPG trope of like, I'm just gonna hold on to all of my potions and never use them.
And by the end you're like, oh, well, actually like I beat the final boss without having to use all of them.
This was like the first time like, oh wow, I'm actually having to use everything in my disposal to get through here.
54:27
But but yeah, so, so we have, we have our signal on on this disk and and it's encrypted, but we need the computing power of a batl BAETYL to decrypted.
And these, if you've encountered them on your weird, you know, ramblings throughout the, the the cut ecosystem thus far, they look like almost kind of like Chihuly glass sculptures that are like somewhat sentient and say weird things like foolish, petty, mortal, bring me 6 items of beef jerky and I will reward you with great physical prowess or something, something in all caps.
55:10
Of course, there are some that are just like sparking out of control and just like not really fully there, but they definitely seem like there's some sort of intelligence behind them to which one of the one of the Verathrites is willing to send you on a death on a death quest to to go out and do it.
55:33
One thing that we're not covering here specifically are the Mechanimus, which is maybe like a whole other 25 minute topic in and of itself.
But this is a faction in the game that resides at the 6th day, still up in the very top left of the world map, and they are a a group of people that worship technology.
55:54
You can say cult.
Yeah, they're they're a cult.
There's lots of cults in this game.
You can say it.
They're a cult that worships technology.
And if you are if if you follow Aaron and I's tutorial video, you can get that reputation up to become exactly join.
56:14
Yeah, you can join the Mcanamis and make your life in in Bethesda Souza much easier at the end of it.
But I think like one thing that kind of stood out to me was like, oh, they worship technology.
This might be why they worship technology because there's still one fully functioning Chihuly glass computer that exists here.
56:35
So maybe there's there's a there's a reason, but but yeah, let's jump into it.
Your Your next quest is going to the north, close to the the northern mountains of Qud, to find the frozen Cryo temple of Bethesda Souza, which leads us into our next track on the soundtrack here, Lazarus.
58:51
You're listening to Lazarus from the Caves of Qud soundtrack the the music that greets you as you enter the frozen cryo barrios of Bethesda Souza and frozen with, with good 'cause I think this is a, a dungeon that you arrive on the surface and there are these giant crag Mensch trolls who hurl boulders at you.
59:21
And the first time I encountered them, like, Oh my God, these guys are invincible.
And then by the time that I came back to them later in the game, like, oh, OK, now I know how to totally, totally deal with these dudes.
But yeah, they, they do not want you in here.
And you you descend this dungeon to 1st the ruined dwarf, which has kind of a river flowing through it.
59:42
But you get through there to the the three levels of the healing pools.
And these are areas filled with this healing convalescence fluid where you have to fight 3 mega troll bosses one after the other, luckily only one per floor.
1:00:05
But the first one where I think this is this is kind of where the game.
And yeah, maybe we'll talk more about this in our next next episode.
If you're playing on permit death mode, this is where you're in for a rude introduction if you are not extremely well prepared because you are met first with Joe Tune, who parts limbs, who throws axes from almost across most of the screen at you.
1:00:31
But there's, you know, in this game, there's plenty of mental physical mutations or cybernetics that at this point you could have come across to help deal with flying projectiles.
But these are some beefy, beefy trolls.
1:00:47
These are also not invincible characters.
These are things that you can attack with love injectors to get them on your side.
Just let them hand you over their keys to the next stage.
So in in traditional immersive SIM fashion, there's there's many ways to do this, but this is these are typically big wide open combat arenas where if you look in the upper left of your screen, you'll notice the temperature is going down pretty quickly.
1:01:15
But from like 7° to -2 to -11 I think this is Celsius but.
It's it's temperature.
It's units.
It's negative temperature.
Just as long as it's not negative Kelvin, I think we'll be all right.
1:01:31
The the the second of promises.
The second troll is Fjorn Kosif, who knits the icy lattice and carries the key to the next area.
And this guy, I think is a little easier to deal with but, or at least for me because I had ranged weapons at the time.
1:01:47
But the last one is Hagebah, who piles the umbrel path.
And you'll be walking around on this stage thinking, well, like, I know that there's a third troll here, but oh, there he is.
He's invisible.
And one of the one of the things that I was kind of glad to have spoiled for me before going into the end of this area.
1:02:13
And you, there are some context clues here.
Like you'll see the like, puddles of convalescence, like walking towards you, which maybe is kind of a big hint.
But if you were just like, I wonder what that is?
And then your head is split in twain on perma death mode, that can be a little bit of a rude awakening.
1:02:31
But yeah, I think.
There's a.
There's also another big hint if you're like, really keenly paying attention to the interface.
I won't say more than that.
It's nothing a good stun gas grenade can't deal with, that's for sure, but now you've you've dealt with your your trolls and you're heading into the abandoned ward, which feels very much kind of like a medical facility that's been overrun by electric snails and a phase spiders.
1:03:06
This is where the temperature starts getting down pretty low and if you are susceptible to to freezing, you're you're going to be wanting to Don some ape for, but just not wearing it around any any apes that you want to maintain good faction reputation with, you'll you'll dive down through.
1:03:28
This is a pretty lengthy dungeon.
Also, we've only just covered the first few floors, but this goes down through about 10 dungeon floors or so of fighting all these frozen monsters of sorts.
Possibly encountering a a neutral NPC called The Alchemist who kind of carries like one of every like a a little drop of every substance in the game.
1:03:54
Or at least most of them, including but not limited to neutron flux and I believe cloning, drought, draft, drought, draft, draft, cloning, draft.
I think it's draft.
It's spelled drought, which yeah, for for later game stuff can become quite valuable, but you'll descend into cybernetics wards where if you are a cybernetic character, here's here's some areas for you to install some cybernetics.
1:04:22
It's kind of a a lengthy process to get to There's easier ones, but there's a lot of goods environmental storytelling here of you know, there's there's medical bays, there's cybernetic warts, there's big healing pools like what on earth was going on here in the before times like this is a super ancient area.
1:04:41
You'll descend further to an area that is the titular cryo barrios that houses cryogenic like I'm, I'm picturing you like those cryogenic prisons that they have from that one Sylvester Stallone movie whose name escapes me but I'm sure Andrew was able to pick up on in 2 seconds.
1:05:03
Demolition Man, There you go.
What was the?
3 shells for.
In in classic Demolition Man fashion, you are.
You're walking through frozen prisons housing a a big rhino monster, a a some kind of plant that possibly had good reason to be locked away.
1:05:33
And I believe this is not a clone, but a the actual V titular Qud monster.
Qud John Qudd?
He may as well be John.
It is.
It is Saad Amus, the Sky Bear, who has a a a jet pack and a ceremonial vibro vibro dagger.
1:05:58
Kopesh.
Kopesh.
Yeah, that sounds like a good a good pronunciation.
Sure, the part axe, part sword.
Egyptian weapon, of course, Famously wielded by jetpack flying bears.
1:06:14
John Qudd.
John Qudd so Qudd himself and iconic weapon.
This this Sky Bear, who I believe dates back to the time the of the ancient Sultanate the Eaters, possibly an Eater himself is, is locked away in this Caro prison.
1:06:32
But this wouldn't be fun if it was just a bunch of possibly extremely hostile creatures locked away in a Caro prison.
You're going to need a cannibal carrying a fully operational missile launcher walking around here, who, if you aggro them and that missile launcher goes astray, can start unlocking these monsters to start chasing you around.
1:06:52
Oh, that's fun.
That's that's good design.
And, and a little, a little flavor text about Saad Amus, the sky bearer champion of Saloom.
There is there is a way that you can look at like deep, deep lore in history about certain unique items in this game, and I won't go into into extreme depth about it, but there's a a story that you can look up on his jetpack that the game presents in.
1:07:22
I don't know if this is how the eaters used to talk, but like old English, like like actual like written like Ye Olde with an E English that basically instructs that this, this hero of the before times fought some extra dimensional, extra dimensional entity and locked it away.
1:07:48
And this, this is the way that we're going to remember him by, I guess, ironically locking him away in a frozen cryo mist, maybe to be broken out in case of emergency.
But yeah, this is.
That's where we say locked him away in the jet pack and was like using him for fuel or something.
1:08:06
Yeah.
They sure did lock him away with all of his tools and weapons.
That was the that was the choice.
Why?
Why is this flavor text on his jetpack?
You know.
I was the jetpack instrumental in the locking in some way.
It's not listed on his dagger, which is also interesting.
1:08:25
I don't know if the jetpack was Yeah, if that was.
The jetpack is I think iconic of them.
Like other people might have a vibrating kopish, but not everyone has a, a flume, you know, a jet pack in in much the same way.
1:08:43
And I mean in, in a kind of like, you know, I'm sure people will resent me for saying this, but like in a kind of a dark Soulsian sense, like you do pick up lore and flavor from the description of items.
So it's going to be the iconic item of that character rather than the sort of the generic accessories.
1:09:02
Right.
So this is like this is the jet pack of the bear.
Yeah, and I believe even if you find another flume flyer in the world, it's still like a pretender of Sad Assad's flume flyer.
OK, that makes sense.
1:09:18
Well, if you if you make it past the the juicing cannibal with this missile launcher and you are not immediately dispatched by an unfrozen champion of the Eaters, you arrive to welcome to the rock.
1:09:35
You are.
You arrive to the Temple of the Rock at the very bottom of the Oh, right.
Now we're talking.
If you if you didn't catch one of those flame bursts and you're not a corpse from Golgotha, you'll arrive here.
And if you're if you're friendly within the cannabis, a nice reprieve.
1:09:54
You come into this basically a holy temple of theirs with armed guards as far as the eye can see, all sorts of dancing, worshipping pilgrims, guard dogs, and at the center of which is a fully functioning Chihuly glass computer that you can insert your data disk into to finally decode the signal.
1:10:21
And that's that's about all that that Bethesda Souza has in store for us.
Well, at least for the main story quest.
Many of these dungeons have extra stuff beneath them should you feel motivated to go digging.
1:10:39
Many of which are kind of well, the the plagues of the gyre that we talked about before, one of which are the Gersh Nephilim, who are I think a good way to describe it is kind of like these horrific giant Kaiju mother brain style monstrosities that reside deep within the the earth of Qud and beneath Bethesusa, of which lies one of them.
1:11:08
And so should you feel motivated to come back to this dungeon later and be like, you know what, I want to go and beat up on this mega, mega beast.
You can you can go digging down through here some extra depth to go and to go and beat them up with.
Some we're we're really going very spoiler heavy.
I wasn't I'm.
1:11:24
Surprised.
Well, I think like that, that it might also kind of tie in with the the big final capital B battle later on.
But you know, there, there's, there's some other stuff.
But yeah.
May or may not.
Yeah.
I, I, I liken to them to the angels from Neon Genesis.
1:11:41
I think that they're almost directly inspired in some ways.
That's a good way.
They feel very, almost too appropriately.
I, I don't know, I don't, I don't like to, I don't like to assume because I'm always wrong.
But they do feel very much like the angels from from Neon Genesis.
1:11:58
You can also get good reputation with them and become allies and loved by them as well.
So they're.
Oh, just just like in the anime?
Yep.
Yeah, true.
Yeah.
So so you decode the signal, you finally come back to to Great Gate and you talk to Otho who says brathroom needs you for an undertaking of great importance.
1:12:21
You've decoded the signal.
You you must next journey to Oman Porch, far to the north.
There the spindle stretches from earth to sky.
Unfortunately, a troublesome merchant from the Consortium of Phaita has relocated there and declared itself Earl of Amman Porch.
1:12:39
We need you to broker a deal so that we may lease control of the spindle.
Failing that, you'll need to dispose of the self appointed Earl.
Be careful on your approach to Omen Porch journey, friend.
So Far East into the reaches of Qud, the Pewtest Templar lie in wait and you ask for more details.
1:12:59
The Pewtest Templar, or the Sons and Daughters as they call themselves, are an order of Knights who claim descendancy from the Eaters, the ancient folk who wrought to the Chrome Halls of Qud.
Beware them for while they despise all mutants, they harbor a special malice for Barathrum.
1:13:17
Take care of that you do not find yourself in inside one of their slave pens.
And so this is this is kind of our first introduction.
If you haven't encountered them already, some of these beefy enemies of they.
They kind of look like holy crusaders, as it were of the pewdest Templar.
1:13:37
But but we move onward to our next track titled Onward as we head northeast to the top center of our world map of Qud, to the Omen Porch, and to the village town nearby of Ezra.
1:14:40
The.
1:15:10
The.
1:15:37
The you're listening to the cozy village tunes of Ezra from the soundtrack titled onward in Caves of Qud.
And this is this is a blinking you miss it kind of village.
That's just one screen to the left of our main story quest item here.
1:15:57
But this is this is a very important village 'cause it has just an incredible amount of like writing drip to it.
And some like, well, we'll come back here in a minute also for another story quest thing.
But this has some of my favorite NPCS in the game to it where one is Mayor Hadas who is a a sentient tree who is thousands of years old who you can talk to.
1:16:27
He's got my vote.
He doesn't teach her vote.
And Mayor Hadas has this Really, this was one of the times where I had to stop and just really kind of take in the writing.
And I've, I've scrubbed a lot of stuff out of this section because there's just so much they want to incorporate, but I, I just couldn't for time purposes.
1:16:47
But Mayor Hidalz probably has my, my favorite writing in the game where you talk to him and he, he talks about Ezra and saying Ezra is more than tree old.
It's stone old.
Seedlings have lived here since our roots dreamed of joggling their fingers at the salt sky.
1:17:05
They ate the earth and belched freight at the stars.
And this place was their stomach.
Later, as the star tree died and they buried their dead under its roots, this was their funerary place.
Now we nurse electric milk from the old and aching temple to turn our wheels and grind our seeds and grains.
1:17:26
Now we are they.
There's much.
There's much more stuff that Mayor Hadas says and I I just wanted to incorporate like every little thing, but that was the best one that I like from them.
Other notable NPCS here include six shrew, who is another sentient plant with a maybe a little bit more of an edge where you you walk up to say, you know, Hey, how's it going?
1:17:50
I'd like to trade some stuff.
And they greet you with Oh, joy, another meat being.
Please tell me you're here to buy something like, well, hey, what what's what's your attitude here, buddy?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I simply adore being assigned to the stinking backwater Musa Grove after decades of service, unceremoniously dumped in an office next to the fleshy tinker who works day and night making all manner of racket through the thinnest, most conductive walls ever crafted.
1:18:18
What is it you humans say?
Living the dream?
Yes, I am living the dream.
There's a tree as well. 6 Shrew, yes I believe.
Yeah, what?
What gave it away?
I.
Could have been a robot.
1:18:35
You know, that's a fairpoint, Yeah, yeah, you know, well, retail stuff, you know, that's I can, I can relate to that.
I can understand that.
And I do want to mention real quick with regards to the to the music.
I'm of course, you know, loving loving the the dungeon synth sound to it and which is which is it feels like it's getting more pronounced as we go on with the soundtrack.
1:19:04
Love them synthesizers.
Yeah, this definitely feels like another kind of cozy refresher from a previous nightmare dungeon, which I think we'll we'll be flipping back and forth between.
Well, actually, no, I'm looking through the soundtrack list.
Yeah, but there's there's some some good cozy ones coming up and someones that might might invoke extreme fear and terror.
1:19:28
Some other notable NPCS here are Yeela Hajj, who is a the village tinker and a part of the Daughters of Exile faction.
And you ask for more detailed daughters of Exile and she says they're we're tinker nuns.
We see the the world sees fit to call us by that, my sisters and me.
1:19:48
Do you know the story told of Rebecca the exile?
She was a teacher to reshef, but he excommunicated her from the Sultanate and banished her from the realm.
To know her I've chosen a life of unbelonging, and among my sisters I have the honor of permanent residence by her gravesite.
1:20:06
I'll tell you this, traveller, the shape of the society is visible only from the outside, and there is peace beyond a boundary which love it like this is.
This is where I think the the writing in cut is really flexing its double muscles and triple jointed features here.
1:20:27
Who is a a former grave robber who says Rebecca was a physician and advisor to Reshef until she lost his favor.
When after years of exile, she lost her voice and her life.
She was buried here and outsider, unfit to be interned with the honored dead.
1:20:44
So she rests here.
I believe her proximity will help me find my credo.
And again, I'm skipping over huge swaths of side quests, one of which is Otham the penitent tells you about various inhabitants of this upcoming mega dungeon that we'll be talking about.
1:21:00
But right here is a very unassuming headstone that just says here lies.
Rebecca succumbed to glat rot with six symbols underneath it.
Which at this time you're like, OK, as you are gathering details about the, the Sultanate and its history, you're gathering details about Reshef as well and learning about Reshef's relationship with this healer Rebecca and, and how they have interacted.
1:21:34
And you've you've finally come across her gravesite and it feels like a very hallowed and humble kind of area, something that possibly of importance later.
There's just a a few little flowers and a little star apple tree right next to it, but rather unassuming otherwise.
1:21:55
But coming back to our main story quest, you go one screen to the right back to Omen porch.
And you you meet with another yet sentient plant named Asfidel, the Earl of almond porch.
And Asfidel greets you, says, welcome to Almond porch traveler.
1:22:14
Enjoy your visit to my earldom.
Feast your eyes upon my tall and glorious spindle.
Take in the scent of roasted Musa.
And this is this is like a big ornate courtyard with with one big gate that you examine.
1:22:30
It says the gate of death and another big gate that says the gate of life.
And there's all these plants hanging out just kind of mulling about.
And this, this area is huge like it, this is, this is normally these dungeons that we've looked at so far, just one kind of 1 screen size.
1:22:49
This is 9 screens of size.
It is quite, quite big.
And so you, you come to this plant, you say, I'd like to at least control of your spindle kind of plant.
And Aspidel replies, least control of my spindle, you say, well, that's a colossal request.
1:23:06
There's no simple price I can assign to such a thing where I took grant such a request.
You would owe me a great debt, you and several of your allies.
I will convene a council, the first council of Amman Porch.
Send word for to four of your allied factions.
1:23:24
Have them send to delegates together.
Perhaps you can appease me.
And I kind of like the audacity of this stupid plant saying like, I feel like there's really nothing stopping you from just like grabbing it by its neck and just being like, just I'm just taking it.
I feel like this plant is maybe like the least threatening guard to this massive ancient site that you've come across.
1:23:49
But this have you tried it?
I have not tried it, but I'm guessing things do not go well.
I mean, you don't know how how dangerous the plant can be until you fight them.
You got to stock up on those defoliant grenades.
That's.
What I always say as a vegan, that's what I always say.
1:24:08
Stock up on them defoliant grenades.
Sorry, what?
All right.
There There's a reason why there's flamethrowers in this game.
But to deal with the plant mayors, all right, this is.
This is where throughout your your.
Travels.
So far you've been gaining reputation with some factions, decreasing it with others, and I feel like at this point, maybe by accident, you may have already just created ally ships with various factions of sorts.
1:24:36
So you convene the council and some of them send NPCS from their village, some send diplomacy droids, which I thought was great, a great touch to this this round table council that happens here.
And you, you choose how you appease the sentient plant who quote owns the spindle.
1:24:59
And your options are to share the burden across all all allies, which decreases your reputation by 50 points with each faction that shows up.
You can share them between two of them.
So you just decrease it by 100.
You can was it spare one faction all obligation by betraying a second faction and selling their secrets to Aspidel.
1:25:20
And so you lose 800 reputation with the betrayed faction and you gain 200 with the spared and you get a faction specific heirloom which is nice.
Or you can invoke the chaos spiel.
Which chaos spiel spiel?
1:25:37
You gotta give a chaos spiel and just.
Spiel spiel, spiel.
Absolutely.
And the the description or the result from this just.
Says question.
Marks and it says plus 3 + 300 reputation with highly entropic beings, which maybe, maybe you'd there might be a reason why you might want that coming up.
1:26:04
And so you you.
Convene the Council.
You.
Say, OK, yes, we are here to to gain control and you you spend your reputation points and Aspidel is is satisfied.
You then come back to to grit gate.
1:26:20
You tell Otho, Otho, I've done it.
I've secured the the spindle for Barathrim and Otho says this is sterling news journey friend.
I'll go and form barathrim straight away.
Who to this point has just been kind of locked away in his study downstairs the whole time.
You haven't seen him yet.
1:26:36
And this is when the screen shakes and a pop up says the whole compound rumbles around you.
The walls creak, loose objects skid about, and dust is stirred up in iridescent clouds.
Otho yells.
Listener, get back here in bright yellow text.
1:26:56
And then this is where it's going to lead us into our next track, Imminent 2 from the Caves of Quds soundtrack.
1:27:36
The.
1:28:04
The.
1:28:41
The You're listening to Imminent 2 by our composer.
Craig Hamilton for the Caves of Quds soundtrack.
The the screen is shaking.
Otho's in a panic.
Says I have grave thoughts.
Listener, listen to me now take this key card.
1:28:57
Go to Ereshkagal's room and oh, that's the the sentient mainframe.
It's what she prefers to be called.
Go to her her room access a Rashkakal and scanned the shale surrounding the enclave for anomalies.
I've asked her to ready her sensors.
1:29:14
Update me with what you learned.
You may use the intercom in the northeast corner of a Rashkakal's room to deliver your update.
Go quickly.
I'd soon be disabused by my fears.
You run through the the grit gate compound to the server room.
1:29:30
Up at the top.
You interface with this sentient mainframe who operates in the thin world as she calls it, and with us living in the thick world in her view.
And you are, you're scanning the area for an incoming invasion by the Pewdest Templar and Otho.
1:29:51
You come back to report to Otho and says, as I feared listener, Gritgate is being assailed.
The Pewdest Templar must have followed you back from Omen Porch.
Let's use this precious little time we have before they arrive to prepare our defenses.
And this is a a little miniature tower defence as it were, where you will have little, little zones where the the roof will collapse in and in will come special operations forces from the Pewdest Templar to come and attack you and the barathromites in your central hub if they're attacking your your compound.
1:30:28
But it's probably worth talking a little bit about the the cutest Templar themselves, who up until this point maybe been a little mysterious.
There are there's a lot of procedurally generated books in this game.
There's some that are not.
1:30:44
There's many that are written by like actual contributors to this game.
And in the Murmur's Prayer by author Kaylin Sandschell writes that they they have a dedication to a family tree as tall and unbranching as Qud's spindle.
1:31:07
There is a a volume Frivolous of Lives.
Volume 1 claims that the Sons of Man operate a stronghold at Oyudin and that they have troubled Qud for over 845 years.
The.
Oh, actually, coming back to the Murmur's Prayer, the OR no Yeah, if you hover over one of the the Templar, the description of them begins with the following.
1:31:33
Oiled and brushed male hangs across their crooked spine and salient jaw.
The color too was sucked out of their irises by their tangled lineage, and their wet rosy lips catch the light and toss it back across a sharp sneer.
1:31:51
There's another book From Entropy to Hierarchy by written by Q Girl says that the Templar on the other hand, are enactors of extremely ordered violence.
Their brutality has been codified into orthodoxy.
Their ideological structures are anti entropic but destructive and important.
1:32:10
They seek to construct a a rigidly hierarchical society with a slave cast on the bottom rung.
Through rituals like the baptism in the Blood of the Reclaimed, they indoctrinate the privileged among their subjects.
The rest of us are met only with force, and this is where the force comes to fruition.
1:32:31
Because you are running around using the mainframe computer to scan for the enemies you're setting up.
Force field the barriers within the gripgate compound to kind of funnel the enemies.
We just did a previous episode just to this was Orcs Must die death trap a a maze building tower defense shooter game.
1:32:54
It's good that we have a little bit of maze defense tower defense shooting in here in a traditional roguelike game.
So you have to balance power, you have to do all that stuff and that's going to lead us into our next track here for attack on Grid Gate. you were listening to the attack The on grit gate in the case.
1:34:52
In like, I don't know, like a like a Lord of the Rings style castle siege of sorts.
And I just feel like it I was playing on my Steam deck on the couch and my heart rate was racing where I'm like, Oh my God, it's like, so what's the context for this actually?
1:35:08
Like starting is there.
Like you, you hit a dialogue tree and then suddenly this just goes.
So the the previous track is when you're preparing for the.
Battle and this is the actual battle so like at some point you'll be like we're ready for the battle and then.
Yeah, you have a guide Buster, the ceiling time or or basically like turns to set up and then.
1:35:29
After a certain amount of.
Time has passed, then the actual invasion starts unprompted and then.
But you'll you'll know what's happening by the extremely aggressive music that starts.
Playing that and the explosions, yeah, yeah, Fair, fair.
And the explosions, yeah, I love.
1:35:47
The that that that kind.
Of blown out sound.
It's very visceral and of course, kind of, you know, evokes and mimics said explosions.
Yeah.
And this is where like perma death for your player.
Character is one thing, this is where you have perma death for NPCS as well.
1:36:06
It is not guaranteed that all of, and a lot of the NPCS in Gritgate here sell good stuff like they sell data discs that you can learn new crafting recipes for.
They sell armaments, they sell potions and tonics and things and they can all be killed.
1:36:27
And you can not have access to that anymore through this invasion.
And it is a kind of a big deal of like, Oh my God, I got to keep this guy alive to make sure I can like buy these data discs later.
Or if you have some clothing draft, you know, you can get creative anyway you you can power up some security robots, some turrets, some some force field barriers.
1:36:49
There's lots of chromelings that you can also power like you were given a a power budget that you can use the kind of power up all these robots and things, stationary turrets and such.
And you're fighting off an invasion of the Putus Templar to keep your your science bears alive through this through this attack when all of a sudden done and you repel the invasion.
1:37:18
Otho if he's still alive.
I'm actually, I wonder who actually gives you this dialogue tree if he's dead or if he's just hiding in a corner somewhere.
He says journey friend.
You have my deepest gratitude.
Few listeners could have defended Gridgate so deftly.
1:37:34
Let me give me some time to assess our losses and consult with Bereth Room and he'll give you kind of like a, like a almost like a score sheet read out of like you did great or you did bad because like all the library books got knocked over and stuff.
He goes on to start noting that no matter how badly this goes, you can.
1:37:53
Progress the storyline there.
There are some some guard railings and some safeguards built into the game to ensure that the the the storyline is not completely derailed.
It doesn't have the Morrowind style the threat of prophecy has been.
1:38:09
Severed, you should just restart.
Yeah, I know.
Well, maybe maybe that's a they.
Should they?
Should change that maybe, I don't know, I'm of two minds.
I'm of two minds.
Worth noting.
I mean, if you want to question how long into the game this is, IIA minimum of I think 6 to 8 hours.
1:38:31
You put work in at this point.
Yeah, you've put.
Genuine time and effort and hours into.
This And if you're playing it real, if you're taking it seriously, it's it's probably 6 to 8 hours.
Could even be more than that depending on how safe you want to be about things.
1:38:49
And so, like, you really don't want to have to just end up in a situation where like a very precious NPC dies.
It already sucks that, you know, like you can you can lose like spare futile or one of the other like notable NPCS here that will sell you good stuff.
1:39:09
So the fact that there are safeguards there is actually really kind of the game.
Yeah.
I feel like that's true in many in in all Rogue.
Like things, the longer the game goes, the less fun dying becomes.
Like dying is fun unless you're 9 hours into the game and you're you're like, OK, I've I've really want to, I'm not having fun anymore.
1:39:30
Yeah, first, you know, you're for.
An hour and you die.
You're like, oh, rats.
Yeah, well, 24 hours in.
Oh, rats.
Well, you just do another 24.
Hour daily challenge run.
Daily challenge run, yeah, Otho goes on to say.
1:39:47
Furthermore, I've spoke with.
Barathram, he praised.
Your handling of the Earl of Amma Porch, and he thanks you for the bravery you exhibited in defending Gritgate.
The attack today reminds us far too long.
We've put our faith in the isolation of our Guild and the preoccupations of the Pudas Templar.
1:40:03
The looming threat of another attack impels Barathrom to accelerate his plans, and with them your position in our Guild.
And you are given another rank level.
You level up, you get to choose more stuff.
And yeah, you you send the ranks within the Barathromites Guild and crucially, you go and are able to meet.
1:40:25
The leader of the Barathromites next and learn what is what is in store for us on the next phase of our journey here as we queue up our next track here for Barathroms study from the Caves of Qud soundtrack.
1:42:05
The.
1:42:34
You're listening to the studious electric sounds of.
Barathrum's study, and this is where we meet the, should be noted, very old, very old leader of the Barathromites, Barathrum himself.
1:42:50
And this is, this is laying out this I think the point of this game here when you talk with Barathrom, the old, you've decoded the signal, you've decrypted it and he studied it and he says the signal is a beacon of welcoming and it originates from the top of the spindle.
1:43:14
The beacon confirmed my hypothesis.
The spindle is an elevator engineered by the space elevator right, engineered by the eaters to convey.
Freight to.
And from the vault of heaven you see nestling in the earliest Aurora of our past, the Eaters of the earth were joined by a great coven of beings that spanned the firmament.
1:43:35
But the Eaters succumbed to some terrible temptation and an injunction was placed on our world.
Since then, the stars were silent to us and our world was left to moulder and decay.
But something changed.
The signal affirms that an entity roosts atop the spindle and invites us to join it.
1:43:53
Dare I say, is the injunction at an end?
It's too early to tell, but alas, there could be hope for our world.
I intend to ascend the spindle and answer the call.
Disciple, my protege Cue Girl, has designed a climber for the ascent.
1:44:10
We intend to construct it piecewise at the enclave in the site itself, but the engineering feat exceeds even our capacity.
With time, I'm confident that we could accomplish it, but the Pewdest Templar rob us of our patients.
We need to act now, and as so loathe as I am to admit it, we need Pax Clank.
1:44:28
Pax Clank is an eccentric mushroom prodigy.
All its faults aside, it's a brilliant scientist and engineer and I have little doubt that it could build the climber faster than we could.
I like how stoic Collins faces at this at the moment.
Several years have passed since we were last in contact, but it owes us a debt and we must now collect.
1:44:49
Unfortunately, no one knows Pax Clanks whereabouts.
Through contacts I've made over the years, I inquired as to its location.
The most I was able to garner were these enigmatic instructions.
Quote.
Seek the heart of the rainbow, Eat the God's flesh and follow the coral path.
I must ask you to decipher this, this enigma.
1:45:09
Find Pax Clank and convince it to construct the climber.
Remind Pax of the deck, that the depth that it owes us.
It strikes me as likely for this quote Rainbow to refer to the rainbow wood where Clanks can consort.
So I suggest you start there.
1:45:26
Oh, yeah, of course.
The Rainbow Wood.
And that's sensible.
For sure.
Yeah, and I think Colin was joking about mushroom men at the start of.
This.
But yeah, we are.
No, I knew there were mushroom men in here.
Oh, OK.
Good, good clairvoyance.
1:45:44
I mean, I'm pretty sure you posted something in our discord about mushroom people, so yeah, very likely.
And yeah, on the world map there's a lot of stuff.
Going on and one of the biomes to the Far East past lake or no before Lake Hinnom is a rainbow wood, which is a very colorful literally rainbow of mushroom trees that grow in the thick of the jungles of Qud.
1:46:11
And this is where you are sent to next.
And there's a way to to very easily find where the, the the quest for this is.
But but yeah, that will that will lead us into our next track here called substrate, which is what greets us upon entering the Rainbow Wood and this kind of general area of the of the world map.
1:47:26
You're listening to Substrate in the Caves of Qud soundtrack.
In case you were missing the the goopy moistness of Golgotha, we've got more liquid pouring sound effects here.
You you arrive to the the Rainbow Wood and you're immediately lost.
1:47:44
It pop up says you lose your way beneath a dense canopy of spores and boy, fluids everywhere.
If it could, yeah, you are greeted with basically.
And we, we will probably talk about this more in the next episode, but fluids are a currency.
1:48:03
In this game and.
It's almost like you've just entered the the bank vault of currencies and liquids here where you have basically like almost every fluid that you can think of in the game, just kind of like openly weeping out into the open.
1:48:20
Here you have giant mushroom trees that are shooting out fungal spores and giving you itchy skin and all sorts of fungal infections and waxy coatings on your limbs and, and you're on the hunt through this mushroom.
1:48:39
It's not it's not quite a maze, but you can't like fast travel over the world map to find it.
You are forced to go on foot through this mushroom Biome and while being chased by primordial oozes who seep out of the ground.
1:48:57
And if they and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe if a primordial sludge walks into a different fluid, it gains, it basically becomes like an upgraded sludge to the point where they can become like, effectively like the most powerful creatures in the game very quickly.
1:49:18
Yeah, they, they, they, they start out as a mono.
Sludge and if they touch a different fluid than the one they currently like exist as then they become a duo sludge and then eventually they can become like a deca hexa sludge where they're just God like they are actually like possibly one of the more powerful creatures in the game if they become like a deca sludge.
1:49:44
Yeah, I mean you, you get achievements, you can get Steam.
Achievements for just killing like a penta sludge and there was one time I was in some other dungeon elsewhere in the game, came across a penta sludge the first time.
Like dear God I gotta get out of here as fast as I possibly can.
They make very good companions though 'cause they're.
1:50:03
They're easy to upgrade.
You.
You befriend them.
When they're small and then make them not small.
Yeah, you make.
Them your, your your weird little freak friend and then they become a.
God Freak, that's Qud baby.
Well, in this rainbow wood, you, you are scouring the area looking for the eater's flesh, which is it's a mushroom vision quest.
1:50:26
As you do in All in all open world RPG games, you'll come across a zone.
It's kind of in the middle of of this rainbow wood world map where there's one tile that looks slightly different.
It's like a bigger mushroom than the rest of them.
1:50:43
That's the that's your goal and there's ways to get to there.
But in that area there is a an exploded fungal ridden corpse who has with them a A really substantially very well written short story on them called a scroll bound by a strand of kelp.
1:51:03
And this is kind of detailing this.
This person's just this like throwaway thing of like this corpse on the ground.
And they're like journey through Qud and becoming a, a part of the seekers of the sightless way, who are psychic hunters, who, if, if you've chosen psychic mutations will come and hunt you down.
1:51:26
And there there was a there's a lot of text in here, but there was one paragraph that I wanted to to crop out just to highlight.
And in this, in this book, they say quote.
I come now to cut in the seekers of the sightless way.
The chanting compelled in my skull into a final ecstasy wherein I joined an aggregate mind the likes of which I hadn't fathomed.
1:51:47
I was primed for it, though, from my first joining on Etton's spine all those years ago, to the right of mirth chaperoned by the free seer, I knew that the site guides us no more than salt does.
There is ecstasy in the aggregate, indeed, and the elder capital E is as powerful as a center, as I've known.
1:52:09
But a center it is still, and where there is a center there is hierarchy, which I think is a very, I wanted to call that out as a very interesting contrast to the Daughters of Exile who very much seek to not be part of a collective.
1:52:25
It goes on in further detail about wanting to escape from the Seekers of the Sightless Way and their Sauron like entity that they are compelled to serve.
And I believe this person is waiting for this hunter to come hunt them down for a final battle, but as their fungal ridden corpse maybe alludes to, maybe they didn't quite win that final battle.
1:52:52
The text is a little nebulous, but I think it's worth a read if you find it.
Or again, all this stuff is up on the Qud wiki that you can go and read through.
And you're just like, like I, I read through it maybe like twice 'cause I didn't understand it the first time, but it just has so much good deep world building to it.
1:53:12
Interestingly enough, I don't think I've ever encountered this corpse.
Really, it it's very easy to miss the Eater's flesh I.
Think is like an orange tint to it, which I think is reserved for items of extra dimensionality.
So like the the Eater's flesh is an extra dimensional mushroom.
1:53:30
You can get weapons that have like extra dimensional properties to them that are also sort of highlighted in orange.
And the, the corpse itself is also orange.
So I, it makes me think that like it is very easy to miss because there's so many colors in this area that are very visually overwhelming.
1:53:47
But you, you pick up one of these mushrooms and you eat it.
And all of a sudden, what was previously hidden is now an orange brick walkway in front of you, which is the the path, the fiber.
Bit of design cool.
1:54:02
Cool your extra dimensional brick.
Your orange brick road.
To follow to to pax Clank you follow this through the the the mushroom woods to basically something that's just like a like a bunch of mushroom walls with no door to it.
1:54:20
You know, like, well, how the hell do I get in here?
For me I just like Faze walked through it but there's nothing preventing you from just knocking down the walls to this guy's house or and you show up and you're like hey pax Clank I'm here on behalf of Barathrim says Clank want no visitors so Clank relocate workshop half dimension away Tasty's after viewing plane.
1:54:45
You're like hey well what what about this?
Are you able to kind of help with this quest that we're on?
And Oh yeah, like what?
What you owe some sort of debt to Barathrim and clank explains Clank puff on prickles during lecture on light reflection refraction prickles angry like, well, what about the debt?
1:55:05
And clank says Clank puff on debt.
They're like, well, are you are you gonna, you gonna help me or not?
Like what's what's your deal here, you weird mushroom freak.
And says Clank puff on you.
You host Clank, you spread Clank for Clank, then your clank shrivels away.
1:55:24
Clank puff on you, then clank build jalopy.
You are given this hilarious extra optional side quest to go and spread Pax Clank, who's a fungus by using this activated ability of like poofing your fungal spores in like an orange cloud.
1:55:41
And you're given like, like, oh, go and spread it on like this item or go like 30 levels deep and spread it deep in the earth or go and spread it like here and there and all sorts of places in between.
1:55:57
So it's an optional thing.
It doesn't preclude like doesn't roadblock you from this main quest.
And Pax Clank agrees to OK, yeah, I'll build your jalopy for you.
Sure.
And well, you know, along the way if you just want to spread my fungal spores around on some extra stuff that that too would be great.
1:56:15
But now that you have, you brokered this mushroom Einstein to join your 'cause you go back to Gripgate and you talk to barathroom.
He's he says, all right, well, I, I have our next step for the quest here.
1:56:30
As if you didn't think it was going to get crazy enough.
Now the climber, this barathroom, the old the climber design relies on the use of electromagnets to interfere with the planet's magnetic field and generate torque.
Unfortunately, the spindle generates its own interfering field.
Perhaps is a mechanism to prevent unwanted ascension.
1:56:48
Our aim is to access the spindle's control unit and disabled the field.
How we accomplish this, however, is an enigma.
From disparate bits across the archives of the Digitum, A reshchedal has stitched together a cryptic but instructional brocade.
She's learned the field can be turned off from a place called Bright Shoal, located in the Thin World and accessible only through Reshef's Tomb inside the Tomb of the Eaters.
1:57:15
Strange this and imprecise, but as Tinkers we know a crude blueprint is better than no blueprint.
You must return to Omen Porch and enter the Tomb of the Eaters.
Once inside, trace the errant paths cut into the mausoleum by robbers and vandals and ascend to Reshef's burial chamber.
1:57:34
As for gaining entrance to the tomb, Reshef sealed the gates 1000 years ago.
But there's a flaw in the seal.
An ancient mark of death has been lost to time, but if you were to recover it and incise the mark on your body, the death gate would open to you, as it did for countless Eater cadavers in the long blurred past.
1:57:54
Recover the mark of death.
Listener, enter the tomb and cross into Brightsholl.
Place your pause once again on the dial and drum and you say, yes, of course, I'll go on this bizarre quest that you have sent on sent before, Ratham says, as I hope you would.
1:58:09
Listener, take this disc with the signal encoded just in case, and take this tattoo gun for when you recover the mark of death.
You want to bring a pickaxe too, or some other instrument for digging through the stone.
And beware, the tomb is a vast and ancient space and sacred to many.
1:58:25
I cannot speak for what you will experience there and then.
You say you are so old.
So old.
You're so old.
Just.
Disgustingly old.
What?
What manner of creature is?
He he's inertia, he's a a very.
1:58:43
Old.
Oh, right, right.
Yes, yeah.
Quills.
Like spindly quills.
It's kind of like a cross between like a bear and a hedgehog.
A bear hog A.
Hedgehog.
Yeah, and.
1:59:02
As you head back to Omen Porch, you will remember that the gravesite of Rebecca has some symbols attached to it at the very bottom that just happened to be the mark of death.
1:59:17
And so you go back to Rebecca's grave and you pick up on that clue of, Oh yes, these strange symbols.
At the most, most of the graves in Qud do not have these strange symbols on them as far as I know, maybe all of them except for this one.
And so you use the tattoo gun to tattoo that symbol somewhere on your body, as well as any kind of other tattoo that you should, you should be so desired to to inscribe on your lower back, for example.
1:59:48
Yeah, I, I, what did I do?
I put a, a, a smiling dwarf picture on my left hand and the mark of death on my right hand, I'm pretty sure.
And yeah, this will you walk?
Up to the the left.
Side Gate of Death bearing the Mark of the Dead, and opens up into our next track, titled Among the Tomb of the Eater.
2:01:59
You're listening to Among the Tomb of the Eaters, where.
We have now entered the the 9 zone mega dungeon of Cut and possibly like the the titular super dungeon of the game.
2:02:15
You enter and immediately have to jump down into basically a oh, like a catacomb filled with skulls.
And there's, there's kind of a lot to unpack here.
2:02:31
We could maybe do an entire podcast episode just on this dungeon.
There's all sorts of grave robbers and monsters and a weird mechanic that because you have the mark of death on your hand, you are there's like a a toll of the dead that resets your position back to like grave zones.
2:02:57
So you're kind of, well, that sounds fun.
You're kind of given like a timer to like, OK.
I've got to like jump from safety to zone to.
Safety zone between walls of compacted bone and like robot security guards and more gelatinous oozes and and all sorts of other kind of inhabitants of of this tune but and and presumably this particular mega dungeon has.
2:03:29
Been in the game for a while.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I I think it was just.
Exactly added.
When I started playing the game, oh OK, all right, it was like the the last thing I heard.
Was like added.
To it the only thing I heard is like, Oh yeah, they they updated the game with like some kind of crazy temple with gods.
2:03:53
You heard Tomb of the Eaters?
Say no more.
Yeah, as long as we're spoiling things, it's worth mentioning you do not need to tattoo yourself.
Yeah, if you have, if you have a means of like just phasing.
Through walls you can, just like you could jump into this like halfway through the game no problem.
2:04:12
I mean, there's always the trusty pickaxe that too.
They pretty much obey.
Like.
Tell you.
Right, straight up, you're going to need a pickaxe.
Well, ever since we played Spelunky and had such a.
2:04:28
Terrible time with it.
I've written off all pickaxes in all games.
Well, so that's why you guys like a jackhammer, yeah?
One of the one of the classes starts with a jackhammer.
Oh.
Duly noted.
But as you progress there.
2:04:43
You you start on like the the folk.
Catacombs level, which is just like, it's just a big pit that we throw skulls into.
And as you, as you ascend, you're, you're kind of like circling around the spindle here and, and like instead of going down like you would in the previous dungeons, you're going upwards.
2:05:05
So you're circling around and kind of spiraling upwards to through like access corridors.
And then you reach the crematorium level where the like in, in classic Golgotha fashion, conveyor belts are going through flame vents and you have like giant industrial fans blowing you around.
2:05:29
And there's fusion power stations.
This is like literal factorial area because there's rotating machine arms that are moving stuff.
There's there's I think this is a very cute thing in the game.
There are robotic urn dusters that are just like a little arm with a little dusting thing on it that move around and like dust, dust the the ash urns and there are there are Crips around here with just like lewd everywhere.
2:05:57
This is like a a grave robbers treasure trove in a way, but there's just there's so much like I'm just looking through the wiki page here.
There's there's so many monsters and lag roots and gelatinous cupolas and ghost perches and stairwell teleporters.
2:06:17
Like there's, there's a ton to go over here that we're we're just going to have to pass by in the in the sake of time.
But, but this is one of those areas where it's just, there's so much stuff happening that like you can blink and miss all of like the holograph or the, the, the computer terminal interfaces of the dead and, and things like that.
2:06:41
But you will, you'll progress up through the crypts, through the, through from folk level crypts to nobility crypts up until you reach the historic sites of the Sultan tombs.
And this is where it's going to take us into our next track here for Deeper Eaters from Caves of Qud.
2:08:07
You are listening to Deeper Eaters from the Caves of Quds soundtrack.
This is the part of the Tomb of the Eaters from the Inner Tomb where there's no enemies.
Here you have entered an area.
A dialogue box pops up says you feel some ambient astral friction here.
2:08:25
It says some dimensional interlopers attempt to enter this region of space-time, but the ambient normality field keeps them at Bay.
I have a lot written down here.
I'm going to skip over a lot of it because this is another kind of thing to experience yourself.
But as as you've progressed through the game and you've been learning about these procedurally generated sultans, 5 out of the six of them and the non procedurally generated 1 reshef that's the same every time you're learning clues about like, oh, who were these these people beforehand?
2:08:58
And some of them have ancient historic sites detailing like, oh, at this site.
This is where Yappa Raptor the second built their College of of books and instructed everyone in the land of healing the stuff or whatever.
2:09:19
Very kind of like specific interpretations of history as that it as detailed by the statues that you found throughout the course of the game outside of this tomb.
You come into this tomb and you go up one by one through the levels for each of these sultans of the previous histories.
2:09:37
And you look at the walls and what's engraved on them.
And something's not quite adding up here because you're reading new takes on the histories that you've already encountered thus far.
Things like instead of, oh, instead of them constructing the library, they actually were a librarian and they had their books stolen from them instead of instructing the land.
2:10:03
Very interesting twists like that.
And in each of these tombs there's a big reliquary of game breaking Sultan loot, if it wasn't lost by them throughout the histories that are guarded by like elite super monsters who are cultists who who swear allegiance to these people.
2:10:25
So should you feel so desired to try to loot and fight your way, have at it.
But as you ascend, you, you come to the, the, the, the grave site of Reshef himself, the, the last, the final Sultan that is unfinished.
2:10:46
There's there's no inscriptions here.
There's no guards around a reliquary.
There's no, there's no treasure chest.
There's just an empty tomb.
What's going on here?
And there is a, a robot there named who I, I can only just assume is a pun on the ancient Greek historian Herodotus.
2:11:05
The the robot is called Herodoticus, who like his Greek counterpart is the inscriber for all these things.
And you enter a very hilarious dialogue tree with him, which I won't spoil too much of, but he basically says like what?
2:11:22
What?
What do you mean Reshef is dead?
What do you mean the sultanate been dissolved?
Someone would have told me by now, surely.
And through different dialogue tree options.
You can say no Harada, because I am Reshef, you will unto me now puny servant.
2:11:39
Or you can say Nope, just just do it.
And he says well OK, but first I have to image your head.
Read yourself's narratives from the folds of your brain, cross check it against the thin world's ambient log of your life's deeds.
2:11:56
Then I stylize the story and engrave.
It on the walls.
Once I'm done, then you can tune yourself and he goes about inscribing on the walls the very things that you are greeted with at the start of the title sequence of the game.
2:12:14
These the little yellow tile thingies that detail like these little images of like what you have done in the game so far to great detail with some twists like instead of going and doing a quest for Barathram, it it has some very, we'll say generic interpretations applied to it that you're reading and you're like, wait, that's not what happened.
2:12:44
I didn't do that.
What are you writing that down for?
That wasn't the what I did at all.
But in the end you are tasked with entering the sarcophagus of Reshef and the screen pops up with a a dialogue box that says the sealing mechanisms inside the sarcophagus will certainly kill you if you close yourself inside.
2:13:06
Are you sure you want to enter the sarcophagus?
Type in tomb to confirm.
Wow a real a real dungeon master.
Are you sure?
OK, sort of thing.
And that's that's what you.
2:13:22
Do and you are entombed.
The end and the credits roll Caves of Qud.
That would be wild that this used to be the end of the game.
What a really.
Well, with with a with a little extra part here, but so and you were greeted with a with a tombstone like you would if you died normally throughout the course of this game.
2:13:45
It says like listener name you were in.
Entombed.
In the burial Chamber of Reshef the Laugh Sultan, it gives you the little log of like.
These are the things that you were doing up until you were you were killed.
And then it just kind of fades out to black and you're like, what?
No, did I actually die?
2:14:01
What?
What did Barathrim?
Sign me up for here.
And then there's like, like computer Babble that goes across the screen like you're being, it's like, it's like the matrix where like you're being presented all of like these squiggles and squabbles of, of computer generated nonsense.
2:14:21
And it looks like a, like a computer bootloader screen that comes up that says like, if you can kind of like squint your eyes and look at it very quickly.
It says Ninhersag, which is in the same Sumerian family as a reschagal, the sentient computer from Gridgate.
2:14:41
And it it has some things like like get seed MOVBSHEOL, put seed things that look very computer Y from like a BIOS booting perspective.
It goes into more kind of squiggly nonsense.
2:14:59
And then it fades back out into the text come up and says the darkness recedes and a new light breaks on the shores of your mind.
This will take us into what used to be the end of the game, which is our next soundtrack.
2:15:14
Attenuated signals fractals for bright Shoal.
2:16:02
You are listening to attenuated signals, comma fractals from the.
Caves of Qud soundtrack.
This is what?
The soundtrack that greets you when you enter Bright Shoal, which is, for all intents and purposes, cut heaven.
Yeah, or the cut afterlife or something else.
2:16:22
Question mark that that I I will say without spoiling too too much of the end end game.
Take note of this area is is all that really that I'll say like the the look and feel and design of this area.
2:16:39
You are you are walking down what seems to be like this very verdant.
I guess if it was green because it's all blue hologram world that looks very much like when you encounter holograms of eaters or holograms of other statues and things throughout the game.
2:17:01
This is the exact same aesthetic.
It's the exact same animation palette that is used here and you encounter a a blue NPC here called Rainwater Schumer, who you talk with and who has a very like.
2:17:18
If I read out what they're saying, it sounds a lot more intelligible than when you read it because they are speaking and again Ye Olde English who says Saad welcome Saad from thine Here is shaken the wet and old life which OLDELIF to give you an indication.
2:17:38
Saad into a small vessel pouring hit Saad to thine sash attachin the vessel Saad crossing new through the high gate and into bright Shoal.
I won't read everything that they have to say here, but this is this is kind of your Saint Peter to the gates of whatever lies beyond here, The hollow gates, the hollow gates.
2:18:06
Sad.
Standing.
That's pretty.
Good standing due at the height gate to.
Bright.
Shoal Vine here's been wet with old life, shaken thine head and cross into new life life a loft of Gaius a, a city twinkling and they're the serif Dreamin and Brightshull is the dream.
2:18:33
And you take a note in your your in your journal.
The Schomer rainwater claims that Brightshull is the dream of a serif who lives atop the spindle.
And you, you negotiate with with this ghostly entity to say, I've come from from the thick world with the mission to disable the spindle's magnetic field.
2:18:51
Can you do this for me?
And rainwater Shomer sits for a while and says sad the serif spricken sad though Askin and the shroom Ascenton sad.
Wilt thou return to Salome or crossin into bright Shoal?
2:19:10
And so you were given a, a, a task.
Do you you want to end it here or do you want to keep going?
And this used to be the end of the game where your only option was to just straight up end it.
And you cross into the afterlife and what happens happens.
And whatever things that the barathromites get up to, I guess we'll just have to wait and see until one point O, which is what happens next.
2:19:36
So if you choose to to go back to the world of Qud, previously called Saloom, then you are basically like killed again as it were, and reanimated in a different part of the map where the title or the screen pops up.
2:19:58
The matter of your new body starts to thicken and clot.
You're inlaid with ribbons of bone, tissue, nerve and flesh.
The neoteric body is differently charged.
Tying inside you is another of the secret knots that bind the world.
2:20:14
And you are, you're given a bunch of upgrade points and all that stuff and XP dump and you're a special boy now.
Yeah, you are a special boy.
You've literally come back from the dead and disabled the magnetic field.
I'm scrolling through it, multiple pages of notes that I have here to kind of keep it moving.
2:20:33
And at this point you'll, you'll head back to to Gridgate to talk with Barathrom.
And he says you appear refreshed.
My old eyes spy the swim lines of the waking world, and to you they cede precedence.
A newness obtains.
2:20:51
And you say, hey, breath room, I disabled the electromagnetic field for you.
Let's add a deep and relieved sigh.
You are ever a Courier of bright tidings, Listener, I am fond of this fact.
Categories and types are decohering in these historic times.
2:21:06
Nonetheless, the ritual nourishes us.
You are you are raised to the rank of Maven, the one who understands.
And so Brathroom is laying out our final quest here.
We're we're turning the corner towards the last bits of this main story here, he says.
2:21:23
High up on the mount above Omen Porch, the Pewdest Templar watch us through their war lenses and prepare an attack.
The Gersh Nephilim to stir from their cradles on the moon, stare and slump with infernal purpose.
The short of this is due to a dearth of prep time and recording time here, and inadequate armament.
2:21:43
Pax Clank no longer believes in the viability of Q Girls climber design.
We must take Clank at its word here.
This disheartens us.
But there's another hope.
Clank has offered up a new design, something unconventional at all angles.
And despite our early misgivings, Q Girl and I now work in assistance to the project.
2:22:00
A new creature struggles to be born listener, and you will help birth it.
Then it will carry us, you and I, to the top of the spindle.
Pax Clank will mold the creature from raw bioelectrical materials.
You must gather these entrails, a body as a model, a catalyst to charge the Sanguine Fluid, the Atsmos as a de aesthetic direction, the armament for protection and the Hamza for personality.
2:22:27
You will bond with this creature too, and act as its pilot.
You must speak in incantation to inscribe the connection.
You'll also need to procure the Sanguine Fluid itself and to a power source shielded from electromagnetic attacks.
Yes, the question of power.
The Evangelion.
2:22:43
You are literally building it.
A a Qud Gundam.
At the end of this Quddom all right.
Sweet and Bratham.
Says yes.
The question of power is a trickier one.
Our standard power sources might suffice, but they would be vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks on the ascent, and we believe it is within the competency of the Pewdest Templar to execute such an attack.
2:23:07
This leaves us with two options.
Clank and Q Girl have worked out a design for a neutronic battery free from vulnerabilities on the EM spectrum, but it requires 3 drams of neutron flex.
The alternative is remote power, but to carry us across the spindle's length, the power would have to be extraordinary.
2:23:24
I would look to Shava, the Tree of Life for a psychic quickening.
Reports tell us of the resumption of their roaming the trees, roaming across the moon Stair.
Seek the trunk at Iron Rogge and begin your investigation if that's the path that you choose.
2:23:41
And so, yeah, you are literally constructing A Qud golem.
And at this point, like you may have already procured a lot of these items throughout the course of the game, but things basically like collecting weapons or fluids or things like that.
But powering the golem is is quite the choice.
2:23:59
And I chose to do the long path here.
And I, I promise we will be quick with this next one.
But 'cause I know Colin's getting a little a little itchy here, but this one I think is maybe my favorite track in the whole soundtrack.
And this is one of of one of the most hostile biomes in Caves of Qud to the far, Far East.
2:24:22
This is where it's going to take us to the Moon Stair.
2:26:14
You're listening to Moon stare from the caves.
Of Quds soundtrack I was proper end game music here yeah this is a an entirely.
Optional area where if in.
Theory you were like, you know, I already got the neutron flux.
It's fine.
2:26:30
You would miss out on some of like the most creative stuff in the game here.
Just the description of the Moon stare like on the world map tiles.
It says hex prisms burst out of black marble beds and their edges deco here as warm static dew.
2:26:46
The stare purrs at a low frequency and your your quest is Iron Rogge, a trunk of a wandering crystalline tree that meanders about this Biome where the description of this tree is tucked into a marble glade is the cloven trunk of Shava, the tree of life.
2:27:10
It's fallen leaves lay like a mirrored carpet and the dream wrens chur a cycle Carol.
There's just there's a a lot going on here.
The moon stair is probably like, even if you are a high level character, still crazy dangerous.
2:27:29
This is where, you know, it's really funny 'cause I have a such a different perspective on the Moonster.
Really.
Yeah.
I mean, I think Bethesda Sousa really sets you it.
It really forces you to acknowledge at the very least the importance of reputation.
If you get to Moonster with the right context, it it is actually very kind, fascinating.
2:27:52
And is that because?
Like you can you can up your Rep with oozes or mechanical apes or Chrome pyramids.
Yeah, like the Chrome Chrome pyramids are just robots, right?
And they are without.
2:28:07
A doubt the most dangerous thing in the game.
I I think it's fair to say that they're, I think one of the few things in the game that can instantaneously vaporize you even without knowing.
Like you have like a turn to react maybe, and that's being kind.
2:28:24
Yeah, but if you're friends with the robots, you know, fascinating.
Yeah, I.
I think I was maybe neutral or maybe not super great friends with robots.
But yeah, you have robot donning apes.
You have leering stalkers which are effectively like metal gears roaming around here.
2:28:41
You have Chrome pyramids, which you will you will know that they're there before you see them because they have like reality warping, like almost like like ripples across the screen that that come about.
But they they have force fields, they have rocket launchers, they teleport.
2:28:59
They are giant FU pyramids that almost belong something like from one of the Destiny expansions of sorts.
And this is like, it is a super hostile environment that you're trudging back and forth, avoiding pools of warm static, which can randomize any effect that you have.
2:29:20
They can give you good effects, they can give you bad effects.
There are hexagonal crystals here that have a chance of creating exceptionally dangerous evil twins of your player character if broken.
There is, there's just there.
I, I joke a lot about like binary trees with with like coding interviews and stuff Here they don't have binary trees.
2:29:45
They have N dash airy trees because of the fractal nature of the area they have.
There are N dimensional tortoises running around.
There are unicorns.
There are just straight up triangles.
2:30:03
This This feels like the zone from stalker.
This feels like the forbidden area from roadside picnic.
This feels like the place that like aliens have crashed landed on the cut and taken over this area.
2:30:19
And maybe this is the future.
Maybe this is our future, our dawning apes, our our future are all of these dream crangles that meander about.
But your goal here is to seek out this tree.
You're you're given a quest by one of the trees leaves to take the leaf back to the trunk and descend 40 levels deep into the earth to the the taproot.
2:30:43
And I'm skipping over a lot here.
There's so much to cover.
But you you get to the bottom 40 levels deep and you are greeted by a legendary seeker of the sightless way, a psychic hunter called IOG, no longer servant of Tow in the cosmic wood.
2:31:01
Who you say you come up and you say like greetings and they very callous to say the utensil arrives you to prune the fate rhizome and free our girl.
Now go and perform the motion.
You say you're a secret in a sightless way utensil.
2:31:20
Yes, that is my avocation.
The million dead sons or the 1,000,000 sun dead homes.
I have roved a trillion more away.
I'm a worm in the loam of a cosmic wood perched on a cosmic gulf swathed in the God, in the God manifold.
2:31:38
And you ask like where are you taking this?
This like kind of dead NPC that I'm taking to its burial site and they say prune the utensil prunes, but no, the utensil quivers and is and an uncertainly and vibrates out a question.
2:31:55
The self is riddled with category errors.
The thinking brain mistakes formation for meaning.
You're like, please tell me I wish to understand maggot.
What do you think?
Words are arrows of inquiry.
Words are bricks.
Each spoken is laid in bond and builds your prison.
2:32:13
There is no understanding you say.
You reply back.
I think with one of the best lines in the game, bricks can be thrown too.
That's right up there, right up there with live.
And drink piss.
It's.
One of my favorite lines in the entire game of it.
2:32:32
Live.
And drink and then so IOG says.
You tarry on the.
Future's boundary with abandoned.
Utensil.
Throw your brick if you dare.
Just I can give a lot of context for this place and it's.
Worth noting that.
I think that Chava and this completely optional quest is possibly the most important context for the actual end of the game, in my opinion.
2:32:57
Yeah, there is.
There's some stuff that I'm glossing over about why you're taking.
This NPC to its quote burial site to be added into this almost psychic board collective of extra dimensional chaos entities because these these NPCS have kind of seen the the plague of the Gyre, but they can also kind of see into the future and they're scared of what the future the of the very near future might portend.
2:33:29
So what I'm hearing is if we get this far, do this.
Quest.
I think it's it's optional for the.
Game, but not optional.
For this the the thought of this wouldn't say that you, I, I would not I wouldn't put it to anyone that.
You should do the quest, I'd say maybe on your second or third playthrough if you are like for me, two things are true about Caves of Qud.
2:33:52
There's there's two reward structures for accomplishing anything and everything in the game.
One is the actual soundtrack.
I see it as the reward structure when you actually get a new piece of soundtrack that is, that is the reward for all of your effort and trial.
And the second one is context, like having context for all the the gobbledygook words that are thrown at you at the beginning of the game is no, no other game touches it as far as I'm concerned in terms of that because it it really does make sense out of the pile.
2:34:27
And so if you were seeking extra context, like what what is going on here?
Why am I doing all this stuff?
Like we've been going through the entire storyline here.
It's worth noting you can get that far and still not know what am I doing here?
What is the point of all this?
Like the spindle, sure, but like, what is the signal?
2:34:45
What?
What am I doing?
Yeah, there's, there's a really great kind.
Of like 2 layers to the story of like what you're doing and what you're doing within the context of the greater like universe spanning narrative.
And there's no like we you just you can't cover that in like a two 2 1/2 for three hour long podcast.
2:35:06
You can't do it.
It would take us like an entire dedicated podcast to do it or like a like one of those like role play like D&D podcast things of like, all right, session 75.
We're finally in the cosmic wood.
I mean, to do it real justice, you do one, one episode per song.
There you go.
2:35:21
That's.
Right, well doing.
Doing these things, laying the the still chime to rest.
You've brokered the the giant psychic tree to power your golem from a remote distance, which Colin, as your engineering background will know, require that's a lot of energy to send over remote transmission.
2:35:45
And you head back to Barathram at Greek gate and you say it's done.
We got the power source.
And he says that's great.
You built the golem.
It's walking around now.
And we're, we're at our final track, or I guess the final track that we're talking about, Brathrim says.
2:36:01
Now our operators at Omen Porch confirm that a clash with the Templar is inevitable.
This is a grim fact, but it does give space for your bond to flower.
Go become familiar with leading and piloting your creature.
When you are ready, we will finally go starward.
2:36:18
And you are.
Your text pops up.
You receive a copy of in all yellow caps Operating manual for large creature exclamation mark.
This is one of the only thing I think this is as far as I know, the only thing that you can enter as like a separate screen zone and pilot and basically become this creature as your player character.
2:36:40
But the only thing that's left now is to take your your custom created Gundam to the battlefield that surely awaits us at the base of the spindle to fight for the the final battle of this game, which is going to take us into the the last track that we'll talk about here, arrival of the official party.
2:38:27
You are listening to the final battle music arrival of the official.
Party from caves of Qud.
This is the music that greets you upon arriving at omen porch for the last time and holy shit like this is like everything that I was looking forward to for like like if if if you enjoy the combat to this game.
2:38:49
Sometimes it can be kind of hit or miss.
This is like a battle of the Pelinor Fields style invasion slash attack slash everything rolled into one where you are you're battling in Ezra.
2:39:06
You are having six shrew the annoyed plant catch on fire and run around and trying to fight some some pewdest Templar.
You have 16 zones or 16 screens around the the the spindle that you have to go and clear out of the of the the Putus Templar thread.
2:39:26
You're fighting night commanders of the Holy Temple, the grand new father, a temple Mecca part Mark 2 from the Putus Templar.
And as if that wasn't enough, they at some point summoned one of the seven Gersh Nephilim themselves to come and fight against you as a kind of like mother brain boss battle here where I I had I had a mask a crew of some pretty tough NPCS with me for this 'cause I knew that this was gonna be a big deal.
2:40:00
And seeing like 6 shrew catch on fire and run around and and die like sent like a wave and of permanence through this, that felt like it had real consequences.
Like the grip gate fight didn't have of like this is it?
This is the final battle.
2:40:16
Like you are marching.
Against, like, Sauron's forces, it feels like, and I feel like the soundtrack here, aside from like, the goofy horn music that kind of sounds a little circusy.
It's just like, in the heat of the battle for this, it is just so overwhelming and so, like, frightening in a way that like, yeah, this, this end battle certainly has earned its reputation.
2:40:42
I think so.
Couple things to know.
I just want to throw in my 2 cents here.
I don't believe the the the Gersh has anything to do with the pewdest Templar.
I don't believe they summon him.
And for me, this track has like a dual purpose of man.
2:41:03
The pewdest Templar sure are lame.
Like they they to me, they represent the horn.
They're just like.
This like little.
Frontier of like we're going to get you you you know, nasty urship and and they're just there and as it transitions, you realize your your actual foe here the the real actual enemy is is this Gersh God like there's nothing there's like nothing else describes them and and it's it's important to note that like when you're piloting the golem like it's so.
2:41:36
Like laughably overpowered that you're just like rolling over all of these Putus Templar ads, as it were.
And like some of the bigger guys are putting up a good fight, but they are definitely like the like the little the little orcs on the Lord of the rings battlefield.
2:41:52
The Gersh Nephilim is like Sauron itself has manifested and like you're wildly overpowered Golem is going toe to toe with so like before that like you get another screen shake and it the screen pops up and says with like 5 LS the electric or the the arcing world moan of the nephilim resounds and your body throbs in the electric air.
2:42:18
It has arrived to the West or some cardinal direct like the Witch King or Sauron from the beginning of the movie in the.
Like the the the intro yeah, 100% and the description.
I so from mine I fought Gersh Algol.
Got, who resides under Golgotha and the description for this guy is a creature of immensity and I think this is for most of them.
2:42:41
A creature of immensity mounts the upper eye line.
The monstrous slumping head is moated with warts and freckles and a soaking wattle reins putrid sauce on the floor.
Years of slouching under pipe works has smashed his dialectipus spine and the sponginess of matter has left him boiling and sick from his surroundings.
2:43:03
Finally, irresidual light churning under his tix glass skin is filtered to a sickening hue and radiates out of body in litus spirals.
That's a bet.
Yeah, I forgot that.
I forgot that you.
2:43:19
That you, you fight one of the seven.
Yeah, one of the seven, unless you make friends with them.
And I think crucially, if you if you go on a hunt of all of them.
Like, let's say you go and kill all six of them.
The last one, like combines all of the powers of the slain ones.
2:43:38
Yeah, that's the one I had it.
I had in mind.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
As strong as that, like I was playing last night at Golgotha, for the record, and and Narf was like, oh, are you going to try and fight the thing?
2:43:56
Like, I don't think I'm ever going to fight that thing.
I don't think I'll ever play play, do a run where I fight.
That thing, it's.
It's that that is the most intimidating creature I've ever seen in a game.
And this is this is something that like you're going toe to toe in, like it's, it's.
2:44:14
Like a Pacific Rim level, like boss battle between some Kaiju and your constructed robot where like this, this one of the seven, like this just this monstrous pile is is like charged.
2:44:30
Like the the aesthetics of this boss battle are amazing too, because like for a tile, like a tile based grid based game, like the little like arcing artistic effects that are shown here, we're like there's like spiraling wave patterns and like you can feel this being charging up and then it shoots out like this rainbow beam in multiple directions, like like in standard mother brain, like format.
2:44:59
You're just like, dear God, what, what even is this?
And you're you're like super Mecca with like it's like super, like xenochrome long blades is like fighting with like against like these giant hooks.
It is it is something that like it looks really silly, just like from a screenshot of like this little like BLOB versus like this other BLOB.
2:45:20
But in the moment it feels like this just absolutely Titanic battle for control of whatever the future is.
But any but yeah, so you eventually and oh, I guess like during all of this, like other Barathromites, like in each one of these screens, there's like Pewdest Templar, like little ABS and there's like Barathromite bear NPCS fighting each other in every one of these screens, like there's like dozens of NPCS dying all the time.
2:45:54
And it is things are happening.
Things are happening, aren't you?
Yes.
And it is just like.
This, this is like we thought Chaos spiel before.
This is it in its entirety.
Like there's just so much bloodbath and like permanent consequence happening.
And hopefully this whole time Barathrim the old has been safely piloting your golem for you or otherwise hiding inside of it, because otherwise I don't think this is quite the space for an old man to be hanging out.
2:46:21
But you, you, you do it.
You defeat the the dead God of the plague, whoever it might be that approaches you at the end here.
And in many of these old traditional roguelike games, there's a concept of that's called ascension where you go down deep into the dungeon, you grab the amulet and you ascend back up to the top.
2:46:40
And here we are literally ascending.
We are ascending the spindle because our golem here has some kind of device that we can attach to.
We, we go through the, the other gate.
We go through the gate of life of the of the the the entryway here into the tomb and you are greeted with like a a graphene ribbon that's just kind of going up and and it just looks like, OK, this this is it.
2:47:06
This is this is where we go to find our fate, basically.
And Barathram says, Are you sure, listener?
Our fates are not reversible past this next event horizon.
Oh, what is it?
I heave, I heave the weight of ass across my crutch, but the bones are pull proof.
2:47:27
My bones in insulcate to this grotto, or rather this grotto.
This world is what my bones are.
Can an old bear divest of his spine?
Leave it to the mosses and to the sunstrung birds.
2:47:44
No matter the will can break the wheel too.
We go pray the weight loss of the rise might do good for me past the shell of the world.
I'm to understand one's burdens can no longer pull them down.
And then you decide to ascend and find what fate awaits you there.
2:48:04
We're not going to spoil that.
We're going to leave it to you because there's we've we've done a lot and I'd I'd applaud my Co host for sticking in this far.
Thank you, Aaron, also for for all of this.
But this is this is where we leave the listener to to see what awaits their fate might be up at the top of the spindle.
2:48:25
And normally I end I end these programs with like, what are similar games?
I guess maybe, But in this case, similar stories and similar games slash stories to this would be, I guess most top of the list is Gamma World, the table tabletop RPG that I think this derives a lot of inspiration from.
2:48:45
There's another kind of version of that called Mutant Crawl Classics.
I was going to recommend that.
One of my favorites.
I I love that game.
Yeah.
Which is.
Maybe, maybe more bite.
Sized.
Colin, I think you mentioned Jean Wolf's Book of the New Sun series feels very very similar in in thematic vibes.
2:49:06
Yeah, makes sense that this game had inspiration pulled from it.
Yeah, there's the the book that I think I.
Mentioned before called Roadside Picnic that definitely it feels very, very Qud like in certain respects.
There is one of one of the quest names I think derives largely from this the book called A canticle for Leibowitz.
2:49:29
I think is is also a solid like Yep, you can 100% see like the the eons of time and cycles of death and rebirth of societies and things like that.
I'll just casually throw in this other book that some people may have heard of Dune.
Maybe you've heard of it feels very appropriate.
2:49:47
And there is one that I think one someone recommended me called Moonbound by the author Robin Sloan, which is supposed to have some pretty some pretty decent Qud vibes.
That's interesting.
I haven't heard of that one.
I also think that there's a lot, I mean, it's.
2:50:03
Pretty obvious, but a lot of religious texts play into caves of Qud, including things like like the Bible and and like some of the sort of Jewish stories.
I can't speak to specifics because I I I'm not some so familiar, but I do know that they they play a fairly large part of sort of the back end of the lore.
2:50:25
Yeah, there is.
There's a lot of stuff going on here about like where like is Qud Earth like there's references to other plate like Earth locations like like the Australian city of.
Perth.
But yeah, like does this take place on a certain part of of like the Levant?
2:50:46
Like is like, what is the connection here between like our real earth world and whatever this kind of 1000 years hence from technological prowess of this dead society?
Like where where does that intersection?
2:51:01
But yeah, I think I think that's kind of going to wrap us up for the main, the main story quest of Caves of Qud in a nutshell, skipping over a ton of stuff.
So this game's been in development for 17 years.
2:51:20
And after after hearing a summary of the storyline I believe it is it still being developed or is 1.0.
I I think I can say because it it was officially stated.
2:51:36
That there will be DLC, there will be post game added.
I can also say that one of the biggest things that is being worked on right now is localization, which, yeah, that, you know, that's that's another 17 years I.
2:51:53
I'm honestly astounded that they even.
Entertained it and I've I've I've been able to see some of the stuff going into it and it's like actual sorcery.
Yeah, that sounds.
I mean just from hearing the the the.
2:52:09
Writing that.
Sounds it seems like something that we extremely difficult to do justice.
Yeah.
Are you gonna, are you gonna translate live?
And.
Drink piss.
That's tastefully yeah.
Tastefully, yeah.
2:52:25
Of course that's that's the answer.
Well played.
Yeah.
Well, do we have anything that we want to?
Wrap up with about the the story before Aaron.
What?
What are you working on?
What?
What?
Where should we TuneIn for more Aaron content?
2:52:45
Well, I'll be honest, I've been taking kind of a break from you too, but you can still.
Find me on there.
I'm big simple on there and I will eventually do more stuff I was working on in the, you know, revised version of the tutorials.
But it is a pretty massive undertaking.
2:53:00
And I won't lie, I kind of burnt out on it a little bit.
But that's not to say I'm giving up on on that endeavor.
So you can still find my old case of good tutorials on there.
They are far less spoilery than this podcast.
They are.
2:53:16
I try to be as careful as possible to kind of, you know, not quite hold your hand, but to explain things in a way that you can still discover the rest of the game without necessarily struggling too much to do so.
Yeah.
And I think we'll, we'll be having Aaron back.
2:53:35
For our second part on the the more kind of gameplay mechanics and overall sort of design of the game, we we didn't talk anything about like, yes, well, this is a this is a real time strategy game, right?
Yeah, exactly.
No, Andrew, it's an FPS I.
2:53:52
Think it's officially.
We we got our first official genre definition for what Cave?
Zucut is on on Blue Sky the other day.
It's a it's a sicko game.
OK, so it's kind of like Slave the Spire, Yeah.
Oh, sorry, we have.
2:54:08
We have a.
We have.
To mention Slay the Spire once per episodes.
Oh, I got you.
I was just ticking that box.
Yeah, it's a Slay the Spire like.
I mean, there is.
It's it's more of.
Slay the spindle, though.
What?
The spindle boom.
There you go, nailed it.
It just takes a little more time to get.
2:54:25
There that that's going to wind down.
Our part?
One of of case of Qud.
I don't think Part 2 will be quite nearly as in as excruciatingly in depth here.
But to to play us out from this massive story experience will be our arrival to what awaits us at the top of the spindle with our our final soundtrack piece here, appropriately titled Arrival.
2:54:55
But we will see you at the top of the spindle in our Part 2, coming in a week discussing more, more of our standard kind of Grog Pod episode format on the the gameplay mechanics and general discussion of the game.
But we will.
We will see you there.
2:55:43
Yeah.
