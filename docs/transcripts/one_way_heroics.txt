hello and welcome to World Dimension gr 0g p08 the grogpod roguelike podcast where each episode of this Multiverse of options we take aim at I guess in this Multiverse we're looking at roguelite games uh I wonder what the grogpod roguelike podcast for a different Multiverse uh would be looking at uh but we look at games from the whole end of the spectrum from your your big Rogues to something like this episode which is a teeny tiny but very influential uh game and we try to we try to rank them as best we can as we were just describing uh before hitting that record button uh uh yeah we we got we got numbers we got thoughts uh I am your host of the grogpod Scott Berger and uh wait hang on uh let's try to get that whistle to catch up on the microphone

whistles I love armor wait are you whistling I did the microphone not catch it I'm trying to but I don't know if the if it's squelching out you need uh you need to turn on original sound for musicians yeah yeah uh this is the this is the problem I ran into in doing uh any sort of weird sound in D and D it's like ah they must not want a whistle or a dog barking like oh but I wanted the dog to park well uh yes uh luckily my Charisma level is just barely high enough for me to be joined by my fellow party members yes uh it's me Andrew Harshman I'm the dancing Merchant classic jrpg staple the dancing Merchant Andrew Harshman and with us uh Colin I am a pirate give us a Yar Yar or something and unfortunately our normal co-host uh will has been brutally savagely murdered by a polar bear um so we'll be joining us tonight he he got caught by the darkness oh oh that's true he did being Actuarial uh on-site uh I don't know what like can you call it an event like it just sounds like the most boring thing on earth quarterly reviews with a mandatory fun dinner afterwards was it like a like a monthly like a monthly business reviewers I think they fly people in it from everywhere quarterly and like read slides to each other yeah it sounds like the way that will is describing it I was just picturing in my mind that uh those scenes from uh Parks and Rec were were uh yeah Ben Wyatt has to go to like the really boring place to work and then quit all the time it's it's like that yeah well this week we're looking at a very straightforward air quotes and linear sorry air quotes uh game one-way heroics this is a game that was released on anybody anybody you guessed it the place in November November 29th 2013. and those facial expressions I think are probably Justified I was released on Steam the following year in 2014 and Nintendo switch in 2020. uh place in let's let's talk a little bit about place in this is not only I think it's a it's a game publisher but it's also from what I can I can parse of its Madness like a web um web version of steam for largely uh Japanese games um they're they have published some games of note that I was I could think of myself okay it's like I know I've heard Place him before somewhere uh you might remember them from the game's bright memory and bright memory infinite might remember them from the uh

va11halla Valhalla cyberpunk bartender action game uh for sure stay tuned games uh we mentioned I think last time world of horror and I don't know how to pronounce this one but gnosia nosia ignacia probably nausea probably gnosis but I remember them most fondly for uh their string of weird uh Seafood based fighting games uh including Ace of seafood fight crab and uh coming coming soon fight crab too oh okay I've heard of my crab aquarium king of crustaceans good name good name wow it's a whole genre a whole sub-genre of fighting games that's outstanding uh kind of a missed opportunity for them not to to pick up and publish uh a game that's kind of taking like the roguelike scene this year by storm crab Champions they are uh but yeah another stay tuned uh for sure and a half uh this game I'm gonna round this game up to being a solo Dev effort by uh the developer named smoking wolf uh as you can imagine a uh japanese-based uh solo Dev who had developed um I think it's called The Wolf RPG editor which is it's like a a platform that you can use to build like your own um like jrpgs on top of oh okay sure it's like kind of like RPG Maker yeah yeah uh and yeah I think you can kind of tell um in a good way but yeah so uh one way heroics rolls in on our data set at least with steam it's hard to pull info from other other vendors but on our steam data set it's the 177th most popular roguelike game 3930 total reviews um Andrew your character's ghost has just encountered a new player on this world gen seed what's the one sentence description they're gonna share of this game well this game is a jrpg that has been really sped up that the time scale has been cranked up in such a way that you are always moving right you are are moving forward you're in fact being chased by the the screen which will which will kill you and you are very rapidly having an entire sort of a SNES era jrpg experience in the span of about oh 30 minutes or so on average and complete with a lot of the tropes uh both positive and negative and uh the adventure and and fun and uh sort of you know action that one would expect from from such an experience culminating with a battle with the Demon Lord which is sort of the stand-in for you know generic uh big bad evil guy um who has at least the way that I interpret the very basic pixel artwork A gloriously like popped caller like this just immense color of evil or a round that is you know attached to the top of his flowing evil cloak um but uh yeah that's that's I think the the whole of it uh did I miss anything no yeah I think you kind of covered it uh except well maybe spoiler alert but the Demon Lord uh I believe is uh uh is supposed to be gender neutral up until you progress their storyline a certain level uh-huh and then it's revealed well I don't know if we want to get into spoilers just a bad evil person yes indeed uh indeed but uh but yeah maybe maybe we can kick off uh the fact that you know this is this is our first jrpg styled roguelike game and up until this point we've been kind of uh uh aligned more with western style RPGs from the DND Universe right I feel like this is this kind of our first foray into the non DND uh RPG land but still kind of embedding a lot of those sort of traditional roguelike uh mechanics and and tropes and themes and stuff so I guess maybe finally we're digging our way out we're clawing up through the giant heaping pile of ameritrash role-playing garbage finally now we can get to some some games of quality well sorry as you're saying we should go around and do and do one shot yeah around the horn what are what are maybe our top uh jrpgs that we have played if any

silence take it away come on because oh boy I just uh I'm buffering here with a wealth of uh Final Fantasy 10 is my like true jrpg that I played all the way through and put many hours into uh but my my true heart is um ogre battle64.

truly loved that game I I don't know I think it's a jrpg I'm pretty sure like you could call that it's definitely from Japan and it's got like a weird it's got if this is a jrpg then that is a jrpg it's got all of the tropes it's got the weird the weird stuff you know little little uh should be slightly larger heads than they should uh figure guys running around doing stuff a great game great game very fun Andrew it seemed like you were you you had a list ready to go oh absolutely uh so I am yeah like kind of a poser in this regard like I have respect for jrpgs but they have never really been just for my personal taste really my cup of tea and of course you know any kind of reviewing and whatnot it's all very subjective games game quality very subjective etc etc you know stuff that we're seeing here stuff I'm saying is just my opinion um so to that end like uh to try to steal some Valor I do own a copy of Final Fantasy one which is signed by Mr sakaguchi himself uh that was a line well worth waiting at Pax West uh let me tell you um uh so that's uh so I got that uh have I ever played that game uh I've watched it be played I watched a friend of mine play it uh looked pretty neat um inter my I guess first and most in-depth I guess jrpg experience was probably with like one of the original Pokemon games like Pokemon Red hmm interesting that was a a formative experience as it was I think for many people um because uh it's uh well actually you know what maybe I need to I'm gonna have to need to immediately amend this but I guess it's a jrpg experience that sticks out in my head a lot because wow you know it's a Game Boy game it was the most involved and like well-formed and like the game a handheld game with such depth that I was really blown away at the time but I guess previous to that I did inherit not inherit because they died but because my cousins got sick of their NES I got their NES and this huge collection of games which included maybe Dragon Quest I want to say one of the Dragon Quest games and Quest Monsters is a great game too that was a weird experience because like I would not bother making a new save I just would load up their saves and just kind of run around like not really know what I was doing just kind of running around and and not making much progress but having some fun um and then I did play oh this is gonna be maybe a little too embarrassing so when I was a young lad Final Fantasy VII of course you know was a big deal and uh I did not have a PlayStation but I rented a PlayStation from the friendly local um you know the rental place rental joint um and um I got this PlayStation got a copy of Final Fantasy VII and I up until this point you know I had only seen the commercials which are if I remember correctly mostly like a cinematic right it's a lot of it's a very you know and I had no idea that it was turn based and so I hooked it up and like the TV I had it on was like such crammy quality that I could barely even make out the letters so I literally was just spamming buttons just to like see what would happen I'm like oh cool and then I finally realized oh wait there's words there oh no wait turn me oh my Lord there's actually I have to actually have to make decisions here um so yeah I uh have not played a lot of these games but I've watched them be played and I'm I don't know at least aware of them because of uh you know what a huge impact they've had on gaming in general it's interesting that you mentioned Pokemon I never would have thought like Pokemon to be a jrpg but I think you're right in that it does kind of fall into that category because your standard jrpgs are kind of like like the biggies that I'll get into in a second but yeah I mean I almost I think I almost failed like fifth and sixth grade because of Pokemon Red specifically uh but I didn't I don't think I really got into jrpg's uh and even then I'm not I don't know that I'm really into them I'm just like like a casual player of the quote-unquote best ones uh but I don't think I played Chrono Trigger until maybe like 2014 or so because I can't I kept thinking like oh man I keep hearing such good things about this I'm so far away from my gaming computer I'll boot it up on this laptop in an emulator and then like like 28 hours later I just I blinked and I'm like oh my God I haven't eaten for days um and then also oh what was the other one is is I cannot can I remember if it's Final Fantasy 4 or Final Fantasy VI the one with like they're they're all Sprites it hasn't moved well wasn't on the PlayStation one anyway uh uh Two Worlds you know you kind of start off with like mechs and stuff uh that one was super great it sounds like four yeah uh I feel like we've gotten real derailed onto the uh jrpg yeah I mean before famously derailed uh the one where you can uh fight a train yeah so yeah I think I feel like this game is like I don't know like it is a jrpg but also I feel like in some ways it's not it's too short like you don't get it's not like a sprawling epic of 28 hours of intricately crafted story and power-ups and blah blah blah and extreme right guys too yeah it's like um it's like the difference between a castle and like a castle and a snow globe like both cool and but one is like a delightful cute miniature version of it right it's not a it's not actually a castle though um it's it's different enough that it's become a different thing that must be judged on its own merits yeah so I guess one way heroics looks like a jrpg it has that kind of aesthetic feel of a jrpg to it with like the even down to like the menu gradients of it feel very at home in like a Super Nintendo uh Final Fantasy game um but yeah the way this game plays is almost totally antithetical to to that kind of stuff it's like uh it's like if you were running around well yeah maybe maybe we'll we'll kind of start getting into it so um you start this game by uh being I think maybe baffled by menu systems where it took me like a surprisingly large amount of time to figure out all right like it's it's you you boot up the game you hit that start adventure button and you're presented with maybe one two three like six six to eight options or something to create a new random world you can put a seed of a world that you want to create you can join a multiplayer world you can join uh someone's Quest you can do challenge modifiers all these different things uh and it kind of feels a little overwhelming at first there's a lot of text on the screen uh there's numbers counting down you're like oh my God which one do I pick eventually you'll pick one and your story will begin with uh your character in a castle a a real castle a snow globe Castle who's who knows uh being greeted by King Victor with a kind of a dark gradient off to one side of the screen and King Victor says uh as you're already aware the world is being consumed by an unknown Darkness uh it's already made its way to the gates of my castle uh please find a way to defeat the Demon Lord and bring peace to this world and boom you're off have fun and you're you're your first goal is to escape the castle before the darkness consumes you and kills everyone else in it as well um

but yeah this this game starts out very very interestingly it just kind of kicks you out the door says get out there have fun start killing stuff and you would be right in thinking that this game looks like you're running around a jrpg Overworld to start with yeah you see the little little chibi monsters like running around the Overworld too you move in Grid spaces and they move in Grid spaces um but the combat here totally anti-jrpg because you just hit the one button for attack monster or I guess you can use special abilities but you hit monster monster dies you get experience the whole that whole fight Loop takes what maybe three seconds pretty fast

so pretty fast yeah and there are no decisions really within the combat until you start adding in like items and stuff right like it's not you're not picking well I guess that's not true

you get the special move so never mind that's that's a wrong statement well for me I think what you were maybe the direction you were going was like you don't have to like navigate to a party member select what fight that you want to use on them and then select what enemy that you want to use the attack onto and like that whole gameplay sequence I don't know can probably take like up to five minutes or something and then like the grinding that you have to do with your standard jrpg in order like all right we gotta gear up to go and fight the to go and fight kefka at the end of the game but oh we're like 20 levels under we better go and roam the the world map and and you know uh write 10 000 slimes yeah exactly uh yeah this game I think streamlines uh quite a bit of that almost to its detriment in some in some cases like you you don't get to grind you do not get to like dally around like the the impending wall of Darkness behind you is a ever-present threat that is like the main decision points of this game I think are like oh I saw this thing down at the bottom of the of the map and I'm near the top like can I get there in time and the answer is often no right and just like well I I don't know what that is I won't see it because every step that you take every action that you make that Wall of Death gets just a little bit closer and you might think to yourself Ah that's fine it's a big open world you come into some of these buildings and dungeons and there's there's some thinking that has to happen if you're like well the save attendant is on the other side of the of the building but I've come to it from like the top down and like half of the building is engulfed in in death

this is where like using your sword or ax to like cut down walls of the building uh to talk to someone through a gap and they're like hey hey can I save my game real quick as they're like getting getting enveloped by a cosmic miasma that was those are some of the most enjoyable the NPC interactions for me yeah it's like oh nice in you got here uh too bad the door is on the opposite side of where I am so I'm gonna get out my magic plus two Rusty picks pickaxe and make my own doorway pop in here talk to everyone realize they don't have anything I want and then just leave without buying anything through a new a second uh door you know doorway that just made but yeah I think I don't that's an interesting I I think that the the Wall of Death uh which in the metal Community is a different thing but it's a wall of death in this game is I think a pretty good gimmick a pretty gay good gameplay feature in my estimation it's uh it's it's engaging I would say yeah and it makes for yeah I guess we kind of we kind of talked about like the maze navigation stuff a little bit but like the the random World Generation stuff is like constantly coming at you almost like a Tetris wall on the mini map we're like oh you have like Mountain chains and like there's bad things that happen and enemies have spawned and you're like I kind of want to avoid those but that's going to send me down into like a mountain Zone down below and all this kind of decision making of like all right how much time do I really have before getting enveloped by the darkness we everyone here has been engulfed by the darkness right yeah indeed and sometimes by accident um yeah uh indeed that that is not involved by the darkness in the first castle because I was in a starting Castle yeah and you started Castle because I was like I want to talk to this person and I was like wait a second I can't get out of this room right oh well I guess let's find out what happens when the darkness gets you but again another kind of interesting gameplay decision mechanic is that so one way heroics has a um a DLC which is effectively like a super expansion and in that expansion which is the version that we were playing the Nintendo switch one has it all bundled together so you don't have to worry but uh there's like building out a castle is a part of it and you can add like wings to the castle and all that good stuff and put like NPC residents that will give you good starting equipment or send you or allow you to embark on quests and things like that but in order to do so you have to build up this kind of metacurrency and it it took me a second to realize this but it it's more expensive the more on the right side of the castle the it is because that's further away from the darkness it gives you more time to go and and do stuff so like right now I only have two wings of the castle unlocked the cheapest ones that are on the left side closest to the darkness so I I have to make a decision whether if I want to go and get this um like stamina upgrade plant or embark on the quest to free the force Knight souls or something like I can't I can't do both because they're both on one side of the castle but you upgraded to both of them before the wall of Darkness gets you yeah exactly um which is like that kind of decision making is peppered throughout here which is uh I've I've heard often heard one way heroics be described as quote neat I think that falls into the quote neat category pretty easily yeah um I'm going to start off leveling my strongest criticism against it which is that they do a very very bad job of explaining what the progression The Meta progression of the game is supposed to be sure I was fully prepared to come in and thrash this game give it a terrible score because I did not realize that the alternate game modes in quotes were the real game modes I I just was playing on basically easy mode that has no that that doesn't have any of the actual like meta progression in it and I just thought that was the game and all of the other ones were like oh you know this fun different Victory mode or do this other thing and like I got like three or four hours into this game before like the only reason I knew was because you you and Andrew were posting like conversations with people I'm like I've never encountered people in like my game really I I've been just playing on the one boring world that has no difficulty and like randomly dying or winning like I don't get how this game is fun and then like oh once you go to the next level it's like things happen now yeah sure suddenly there's more Dungeons and Villages and taverns there's more of everything the map more of everything more challenging uh yeah I had a very similar experience the walk in the park difficulty is literally a walk in the park like mountains don't block your path that much it should be called tutorial mode yeah and I guess you're looking back oh walk in the park it maybe should have been a hint but like the way that they describe it is uh like I literally thought that the the second level of difficulty like the normal standard mode was is like oh it's just the same game but the Demon Lord appears randomly and like that's when you fight him yeah part of the description I think is um like for those who want a special challenge or something it's like and it should say like for those of you who want to actually play one-way heroics like select this I don't know I don't know if you have much of a chance like beating it first time out like you should probably start with the I beat it the first standard one you did okay well play yeah

yeah but like it was it's not that hard and then I then I couldn't beat it on the other character and I couldn't beat it with like the hunter or whatever but but yeah I was like I don't get this game it's like the walk in the park difficulty is like halfway between too easy and then randomly like you don't get as much stuff so like you can't make as many decisions and so like when you get screwed over you just lose there's no there's no like way of mitigating things because you haven't gotten items and maybe also you're just not as far into the meta progression because you don't get stuff you don't get like people showing up in your world or whatever yeah it's like it's like they should have compressed that into maybe like I don't know half as long give you more stuff and like I and not make the afternoon stroll difficulty contingent on beating walk in the park which I think I think that's how it works uh where you have to beat walk in the park in order to unlock afternoon stroll you beat afternoon stroll to unlock the grueling campaign uh and then I think once you've done that you can like you can beat the game three more times any which way you want with any of the crazy uh options that you have including beating it on tutorial mode if you're really desperate um which allows you to unlock like a certain NPC you talk to that NPC and that allows you to find to like go to a special Dimension to go and fight the true final boss of the game but like very like you were saying like very little of this is conveyed to you of like hey by the way you're in like spoilers I didn't know that there was another different boss

yeah and like that's another thing is like the uh one of my biggest criticisms was like the game doesn't like you beat like one boss of the game's like hooray you did it you saved the universe right yeah even in the text it like says like you and your you know fairy Puck whatever you know their name is companion like wander the world with no particular like plan or something like it just says like you're just going around yeah who knows what you're gonna do and it's like well maybe we'll go play the actual game um yeah uh India very very iris is her name actually thank you thank you uh who um has some legitimately useful information appreciate that um yeah uh but I mean you know this it is it is unfortunate that um yeah the progression is not conveyed in a more straightforward fashion um but you know once once you figure that out it does uh yeah definitely improve the gameplay experience uh quite a bit yeah I think perhaps uh we should at some point you know speak on on that yeah I mean I wonder if the switch version is any different I don't know that's a great question I was like this game is really surprisingly good on the steam deck with one caveat that it's missing like a a super crucial component and that is the music so I would hope I would fingers cross hope that the players like on the uh on the switch are able to play it on the go maybe I can suspend and resume at will so you don't have to worry so much about the safe crystals but uh you also have the really rocking midi jams that accompany this game absolutely um and yeah like difficulty difficulty wise walk in the park uh is very limited you can't recruit friendly NPCs it feels kind of like the world is is kind of like too big and not that filled with stuff and then you do the afternoon stroll difficulty like oh my God like there's so much more stuff here there's like there's golems that will chase you and beat you to death uh there is like shrines that give you bonuses there is a lot like a lot more different dungeons that you encounter uh all these kind of things that that you would expect I think from a traditional roguelike experience uh that it's just it feels more fleshed out um and oh the the biggest I guess takeaway is that the we keep calling it the tutorial difficulty but the Demon Lord comes in at like 400 kilometers of of walking distance which is it actually not that long I don't know what like 25 30 minutes at most um but the the quote-unquote true standard difficulty uh the Demon Lord will teleport in at various intervals and you have this this kind of clock system that's also Ambiguously explained in the upper right corner of your screen where every step you take the clock hands will like move around and if they get onto the red line that's what the Demon Lord appears and uh the Demon Lord lies in it's like oh there's there's the hero they keep talking about oh uh uh surrounded by Magic barriers and you know the first time you encounter them you you it's like encountering agent Smith in The Matrix just run uh until you're more leveled up and then when you can Neo punch them uh to death then you're then you're all good but but like that that kind of tension with the afternoon stroll difficulty really kind of turns it on its head and makes it a much more interesting experience especially if you're combining that with doing one of the NPC quests that you can pick up along the way because then you're juggling the two you're like oh I gotta make sure I'm like good enough to beat the Demon Lord but also able to like satisfy this Quest require requirement as I go along

yeah definitely that is pretty uh I don't know good good pacing it's very again very engaging and like uh fun to have to um sort of deal with periodic visits from the Demon Lord uh which I don't know if y'all uh experimented at all with this tactic of um just kind of like like you and a sibling when you're you know kids doing that like tag move where you're just like running around like one big object like you can kind of Psych out the Demon Lord by just sort of keeping a building in between and then finally like after like an hour or something of the Demon Lord not quite being able to catch you um get around the building and find he's just like oh of course you we'll meet again I'm going home yeah exactly yeah where is the Demon Lord in between those those fights um perhaps that's revealed in a later play mode they're probably in the dimensional passageway one of the many biomes that you encounter in this game uh probably a uh so grogpod tip number one uh play a random seed because if you're like me and you got Bamboozled by the start menu and you happen to just like accidentally pick the same like previous game seed that pops up at the top uh you'll be like wait a minute are there only like three biomes in this game or something uh

yeah uh trial and error mode for sure you have um the Wilds you have the Prairie you have ruins snow fields deserts volcanoes mountains the corrupted lands and finally the dimensional passageway Each of which having different monster themes for each one of them like uh like rock monsters that will throw things at you or uh or bats or in one case I was uh starting a a Bard run on some seed and a bunch of tigers descended from the mountains yeah like the super tiger just like ate me in two seconds I'm like okay go back to that seat ever again those tigers have gone bad they got a taste for barred blood and now they they cannot be contained anymore um yeah that is that is fun uh one of the way I was playing it was like all right once I successfully beat the the Demon Lord on a seed I will then move on to generating a new one that was just like I don't know my own regulation of wanting to feel some sense of extra accomplishment um yeah there's a nice nice variety in the different uh you know tiles and monsters and stuff and then there's like also like little modifiers that apply to equipment and NPCs and monsters so like you know uh those tigers that you were referring to you know I can't think of an actual assault example but like you know there you could encounter a veteran tiger or a a a Grizzly tiger or something what have you I think one of them was like a like a fear tiger and they have like this kind of like a cloud around them and like as they as they get closer you're like oh no my character is feared and it has like some some minor debuff associated with it but again like the combat is so fast here that like it's it's almost negligible we're like okay yeah stamp stab stab all right they're dead moving on the next one yeah and if you don't if it's if it's not step stab then you're probably uh in for bad time because it's like oh no if you can't beat it in three or four hits then you probably are should be running away yeah or or doing something else using a special move or something right using one of your abilities to either deal more damage or figure out some way to delay that enemy and get away from it so I mean there's you know a fair amount of engaging decision making going on but not as much as you know maybe a a full-fledged the arpg experience yeah I mean I was just playing on the Grog pod world seed just before this and I was getting real excited pretty good because I'm like all right I've got I've got a good like flow going here I've got my hero class all kitted out got the Charisma points ready to go ready to spend to recruit some NPCs should I need to I've unlocked the ability that uh allows me to convert uh I think at most two non non-uh boss NPCs or like Monsters to fight by my side I come around the corner and there's this like hulking level 500 Gollum that's like yes run away I'm like huh I I stick my Neo hand into the Golem's chest and I convert it to my side and I'm like yes perfect I I'm starting to build up the crew here come across a few different screens and then like I don't know some I wasn't like this is mostly my fault but I come around the corner and some like high level mob comes into view and just like lobs of like three or four fire bombs at me and kills me instantly and I was like maybe I should try that seat again yeah indeed it does get firebombed that's just the way it is that is rough but I will praise uh the fact that there is a save system in here you don't see this typically for a lot of Rogue style games that often right but the way that the the save system here works is that um you know generally in Rogue style games you're incentivized to to not really save your progress and come back later uh you're supposed to like fail and then learn from your experience and and come back better but in this case you know the runs are also so short that it doesn't really matter but um every on some specific Cadence the the time fairy will come in and say would you like to save your game you go yes absolutely and you spend a few of your characters levels uh to do so which is an interesting trade-off um but you can also come across these saved gems and you use those to save your game you can buy those from vendors uh and I was Amanda sits next to me on the couch like what what you should you should show me how to play a game on your steam deck thing like okay let me finish this thing up and I'm like oh [ __ ] I I can't save and there's like there's no save point nearby so I intentionally just like ran around and killed myself and I'm like oh that's right like the game is still saved to that previous point a little bit ago so I could just continue from there kind of a non-issue for most games but for here it felt not too bad because I was like right on the verge of like going and beating the Demon Lord with like a bunch of these different NPCs okay this is great uh so I felt like that worked pretty well in this instance but it might also be necessary for you to to quote get to the end of the world this is this is the thing that the flat earthers were telling us about people uh if you are able to walk uh I think 2 000 kilometers to the right what and eventually and like so for example you're running around in a afternoon stroll mode you've befriended the Demon Lord of course uh so the Demon Lord is now on your side and you're like well I don't have any any end boss to fight right uh uh you keep strolling all the way to the right eventually the darkness will attack and that's another kind of like hidden mini boss in this game you can that you can fight um there's ways to kind of trigger that ahead of time that I think if you use like a holy weapon uh you can like throw the holy weapon into the darkness and start the boss fight there but you might be super under equipped for it um but like again the game kind of gives you no indication that this is happening yeah now like the more you talk about this the more it feels like I didn't play like I I came into being like Oh I feel like I got you know I've done most of the things that the game does and like I can yeah oh now you just you unlock more things you get little companions you play little it's like I felt like I had gotten a good chunk of the game out I was like oh no did I not even did I is there another next level of thing like oh yeah you still haven't started the real game well I mean like this game is interesting because it kind of does what it says on the tin right you you go One Direction and you fight monsters and like the tutorial mode is like this is what you're gonna get with this game you walk to the right you fight some monsters you fight the boss there you go but yeah there's no there's no hook of like oh you've defeated me this time but you haven't defeated my master question mark question mark question mark you're like oh tell me more like what is this other monster that I have to fight um and there is stuff that like yeah in like the other difficulties you can you can keep progressing but it feels like I think Colin from what you've experienced is probably like a good 95 of the gameplay experience yeah but even knowing that there's something more to accomplish like drives like just oh unlock all the characters is I'm not I'm not generally a completionist in my games like I don't I'm not like I can play a game and be satisfied at not having unlocked every character oh yeah I haven't unlocked the wizard yeah whatever like I know what a wizard will do it'll be like uh you know you'll just be different but not like different enough that it's a different game but go 2000 like that I I thought the game was like oh you know you're done between 400 and maybe 500 if you're like really running for ways you're like that's four times further than I thought the end of the game was yeah which is like okay so this is a this is a thing that I should be trying to do yeah like oh that's interesting that's like a I hadn't even really thought of that as a as a something a goal you might try to accomplish yeah the force Knights need to bless the people who maintain the one-way heroics Wiki because there's no way I think I would have ever found out about that if it wasn't for my deep scouring for 14 pages of research for for this week's episode I have tried really hard not to look at the wikis for all the games we're playing I like I have a tendency like if I if I I'm I'm uh I'm all or nothing I can't I I can't restrain myself once I start looking at the wiki I'll look at all the things and I'll spoil everything for me so yeah if there's any consolation the wiki is a little uh hard to navigate I think so you might not be spoiled as many things as you think actually it's probably fine there's worse wikis out there well it's certainly certainly you know Taps into a conversation that could be it's maybe its own episode like how do you how does like needing to rely on a game's Wiki factor into like the overall quality of the game yeah and uh I mean fortunately we're living in an age where a lot of this information is readily available and can kind of shore up and make up for some of the shortcomings and like you know UI and um uh conveyance of information to the player so like that's nice but ideally you know one would be able to play any game uh that's decent you know if if they were stranded on a desert island without access to wikis a wikiless desert island uh what a what a terrible place that would be um yeah that's uh that's interesting uh the 2000 kilometer mark huh that's uh that's pretty nifty that's cool it reminds me of like ski free and like the yeti shows up and eats you but in this case the actual like game mechanic of the Wall comes and attacks you uh good stuff good stuff and I guess to some extent the the 2000 kilometer marker might be kind of Justified to advance some well a recruitable NPC story lines because I think uh like I got super excited because I had two of them in my party I was like okay great like I think I have to have them in my party at the end if I beat the final boss the Demon Lord final boss uh in order to get unlock their special uh epilogue uh sequences and and get those juicy steam achievements that we're also addicted to um but I don't think I got them because you have to chat with them three times in which and what that means is like uh uh your your helpful fairy Bud will say hey I think your your friend wants to talk you should go talk to them menu navigate talk to uh panty The Merc let's say uh and you'll have a conversation with said fellow uh or one of your other NPC friends uh and they'll you know it'll Advance their character motivations and and things like that and you'll learn a little bit more about them and also time the wall will advance every time you talk to them so that's also true you do have to spend it a little bit of time and so you're not there are some disincentives to talk and do that and once you've talked to them only then yeah uh in some cases your your NPC friend will turn into a uh an enemy uh dog or wolf and you have to re-pacify them in order to get them back into your party oh no uh there's yeah there's other stuff about uh some people just being composed of force armor uh interesting stuff that like is kind of let that sort of dark soulsian surprise bit of like oh I'm you know I'm in Colin's shoes I'm glad I didn't look at the wiki because this thing that organically popped up was very surprising uh it seems like those kind of recruitable NPCs if if you keep them in your party long enough that sort of stuff will pop up and be and be fun and surprising

that is neat to hear I definitely did not encounter any of that I did not get that far in the game I played approximately eight hours um and uh yeah it's I mean hearing hearing these things certainly does uh to some extent incentivize me to play more of the game of which just on average I mean I found to be the I found the the standard gameplay Loop to be fairly enjoyable I think another like metagamy thing about this that is sort of hinted at but I don't think is explicitly spelled out because like you should you should go to different seeds and like Farm well Farm in the sense of like if you find good gear dump it into your uh what's it called the dimensional Vault yes you put it in the vault and then you can pull that stuff out on other seeds and it's it's it's not like you can pull it out every time you can only pull it out once and use it for that run which is another kind of interesting trade-off but you know you're running you're in a run you come across some holy weapon or some you know boss level weapon you're like oh this is great I've just beaten the game though I guess maybe I should store this in my dimensional Vault and then if I'm gonna be doing a run later and I want to fight the the dragon on the other side of the darkness oh it's a good thing I store that Holy weapon in My Vault so there's kind of like this other metagame aspect of less less so of like the jrpg style farming of like oh I gotta grind my character up but more of like oh someone on the steam forums found the seed where this really like dope weapon is super early in the game puts it in go to that place get the weapon stored in the vault and then you have it to fight the boss later oh I haven't thought of doing that I I was consistently transferring like this one sword that I had like in between my runs and unfortunately I was not keeping an eye on the durability level and so my epic awesome flaming sword like shattered into pieces um at some point while I was like I don't know fighting a wild dog or something so that was unfortunate but yeah that was a very a very useful feature to be able to uh transfer your gear in between um in between runs uh very helpful uh pretty pretty useful piece of medic progression for sure how long did it take everyone to find where that durability meter was uh uh it's it's next to the title of the item right so you got that almost instantly like it took me forever to figure out that like item durability a was a thing because I thought like wasn't it just using a sword a minute ago and then I was like okay there's a durability in this game where the hell is it hiding I have no idea uh and I'm sure that like the fairy explained it to me at some point I was just like yeah keep keep advancing the text but uh but yeah it seems like there's you know Andrea as you were saying there's like a little meter kind of next to the item's name that unless yeah a meter which is like the height of a you know character like a text character right it's not big that's for sure and it was super clear that it's a meter at first right indeed it's like kind of weird like it's not like a a clear battery meter it's like colored and it like

I don't it's just like a quality thing I don't really know what it is I mean later like it must be the durability but

yeah it's uh is um not ideal I kept um so the The Meta progression like money that you get which is uh well there's a couple but one of them is was it hero points so they are yeah I think that's right yeah you're like your career uh which you spend on unlocking perks and classes and building uh well no I'm sorry you use coins to build uh additions to the castle anyway um I had a few Misadventures with misspending my hero points like um I I didn't quite realize how expensive it was to repair items um like that will just sap your hero points very quickly or maybe it's based on like the power level of this of the sore or the item because again that awesome righteous flaming sort of Demon Lord Vengeance or whatever Demon Lord smoothingness um was I I kept repairing that and that would just like drain my account every time and then I also like saved up a bunch of money because there's a category of things you can buy it's like it's like unlock perks unlock classes um unlock uh repair item then there was one the expand your dimensional Vault and then there was one option that's like a special item and this must be a translation issue I'm like item oh cool it must be an in-game item that is special and it's like a lot of money like awesome I'm gonna save it for that and get that and that's gonna like give me the you know the whatever uh Mueller hammered epic lightsaber weapon um but the special item was just the ability to view the game credits

well you know it gave me a good laugh um I should have read the description I mean it says it right there I read the description I was like I don't really understand what this is but it feels like it's something to do with like special credits and I don't care that much about Professional Credit yeah if you want extra credit on your uh well you can you can see that the game was basically developed by by one guy there's I think a little bit of of uh help with various assets and and things like that but I would say like 90 of this game is developed by by smoking wolf uh and you can see like all the all like the fun art that was involved I think like this game has a like a very good presentation to it like I feel like the uh this like the Sprite work the animation like even like the very anime style like portraitures that you see throughout the game like they're all very well done like you know I know it's not it's not everyone's art style I'm like I'm kind of like yeah on on anime art styles in general but I think it's very well done here outside of like some of the cringy elements but you know that's uh you kind of get what you pay for with a a five dollar solo Dev Japan that made jrpg roguelike game I suppose yeah I mean for five bucks I think it's pretty good value um overall but uh and and Will's not here so we can we can wax on about how great it is when a game is cheap well bill doesn't go in for any of that until I'm Foolery he's like yo game's gonna be good or not and I mean there's there's something to be said for that but um you know in this this society that we're living in so long as we're stuck in capitalism it is you know a factor when you're in you know imbibing when you're taking in entertainment is like well how much money did I have to Fork out how many hero points did I have to pay for this game and uh Hey five bucks even for the amount of time that you know I played the game which is eight hours like that's a pretty good uh ratio of cash to entertainment value um yeah as you said you get what you're paid for uh to some extent with some of the some of the the shortcomings and I mean you know one one person working on a game it's understandable that there would be some some hiccups with the uh usability and and some of the issues that we've been we've been discussing with which are not insurmountable but they are a definite inconvenience that's for sure

yeah I think like maybe maybe one of the last points I'll bring up is like this game I think has kind of like a bamboozling UI at first but once you get it it's like okay like everything is here that I need it to do and it's not it's not a an insignificant challenge to kind of balance all those aspects uh the the uh if I could wish for a one-way heroics 2 that wasn't the actual well the honorary sequel that was developed for this game um called mystery Chronicle one-way heroics uh that one less well received I think because like that game was trying to

maybe maybe do too much I don't know there's like this game has like a certain amount of like Whimsical charm in that you can only really find from some like from a solo Dev who's just like cranking away in their basement for like 18 hours a day like it has that that kind of um like Indescribable it's like uh it's like a small dessert yeah like I feel like that I I feel like we've played a couple of those games where I'm like is this game the best game no but I had you know a decent time playing it uh I don't know if adding more necessarily would make it more for some of these and I don't know if that's necessarily true for this but I I do feel like it has a little bit of that feeling where it's like it's a small self-contained Adventure yeah and adding more might just make it might bog it down yeah totally yeah it definitely is like it it has everything that needs to do maybe my my little teeny tiny nitpicks are like I wish I could just kind of like click and drag some of like the UI elements around the screen but you know again they don't get in the way really that much and a lot of the stuff sort of semi-transparent you can look through it but uh but yeah I think like if it just had that kind of narrative hook of like you've beaten the Demon Lord but have you uh to kind of like Propel you to to keep fighting like the other other mini bosses and look into the other quests that's that's kind of like the only dig I have against it really uh I I tend to agree everything else um negative that I can think of is kind of a nitpick and fairly minor uh well that is probably a good segue time into our our ranking segment where each episode we try to do our our due diligence with numbers and stuff uh with the official cannot be debated uh rankings for where this game will permanently stand and we definitely will not adjust it later uh before our eventual ratings uh playoff session um maybe maybe I'll kick off first this game I think was was a surprising uh hit for me uh I bounced off it kind of hard at first a few months ago and I was I was like oh like it's on sale I'll pick it up for like this like the base game plus the DLC is I don't know like five or seven bucks super cheap uh and I was like I don't really I don't really get it and I think that was the problem calling like what you were saying with like playing on the walk in the park difficulty it's just it's too easy you know there's there's not enough variety and and answer too simple sure yeah yeah um but yeah once once I had kind of crossed over into that path of like okay now I understand the UI elements I kind of understand the gameplay Loop watched like one or two like clicking around like a couple Let's Plays just to see like how do people navigate these menus oh that's how I should do it um the light flipped on and I was like okay great now I know I have like this list of stuff I'm like okay I want to do this I want to do this so for me uh this is gonna drop in at my number seventh game out of the 32 that we've ranked thus far uh just ahead of griftlands and just behind monster train at first I was like could this game be better than monster train it's certain in my opinion it certainly looks a lot better uh but I think once you've once you've kind of unlocked everything in one way heroics I don't know that there's there's that like hook to like then what right you know I've I've beaten the game by collecting everything or beating you know the super final boss uh uh what do I do now so I'm kind of I'm a little skeptical that there might be some uh some you know stuff to do in the end game but uh generally I think in this kind of like meaty chunk that I'm in right now it's it's ticking all those boxes like it you know the music like we still haven't even really talked about the music maybe I'll talk more about that on the on the play out part but like uh all these like elements are coming together in a really nice package that I think is is well done doesn't overstay it's welcome too much uh and yeah it's kind of a good intro to roguelike systems for people who may not have much exposure to the genre here here here speaking of checking boxes uh for for my ranking like wait wait what's the deal with this RPG tradition that's been going on for a while of like yo you either need the key to this Treasure Chest to this box you either need to lock pick it or if you try to break it open you're gonna break the stuff that's inside this idea that you can't break open a treasure chest without damaging the stuff inside I think it's a little overstated it's a little ridiculous I do it every day with Amazon packages I'm tearing those things open I grabbed the nearest you know Club the clearest two by four that I have with a nail stuck through it I just smashed that box until I get it open but um anyway I'm trying to Parlay this into a conversation about how uh hey if something ain't broke don't fix it this sort of takes the the very sort of basic essence of the jrpg gameplay lube and doesn't try to reinvent it um but just sort of like streamline it and make it faster and I think that the game succeeds in my my personal opinion um in distilling down a JP jrpg experience into something that's like fast and and buying and um replayable also and I think it does a pretty good job uh at the end of the day it's not exact jrpgs are really my go-to type of game um but I will uh be ranking this above Eldritch um but uh let's see but not ahead of Binding of Isaac because again you know I go with generally for like sort of like faster arcadey type experiences but um yeah coming from a non-jrpg player I can say that uh I did enjoy this game quite a bit

um all right and on a blast uh I'm gonna put this it this this game is at the peak for me is that the Pinnacle the exact middle the top of the bell curve oh it is 17 out of 32 is in the exact middle of my rankings of these games it is exaggerating middle I feel like it is it is the medium game so far uh it's up it passes the threshold of recommend uh like yeah it was interesting I I feel like I might still be coming off of a little bit of The Hangover of like this game is a bad game because it's stupid and boring and like oh there's more to it like I basically only played the the real game last night right because I had I had written it off so there is a chance it could climb in my internal estimation in the future um but I do think that at least that's like some a knock against it is that it it's meta progression is not particularly evident and there's not a huge drive through it to to get to that stuff um you have to search it out a little bit um and it does get more complexity in it later but it it can appear as a very simple package at first uh there's not a lot of like since Will's not here I'll have to do some of his work for him like the decisions that you're making during the game seem pretty Limited at first um and it does amp up over time and as you get more things I think there are more decisions to be made but uh foreign yeah I don't know it was like pretty fun but like overall not necessarily like the game that I'm looking for uh to spend my time well in our new similar games segment uh I was about to ask yeah what do you got uh Scott so there's so this kind of Falls squarely into this like you know we've talked like oh this is our first four into uh like jrpg roguelike games turns out there's a lot of them uh and they go back to like 1993 turns out uh so there's this whole series called The Mystery Dungeon series of which there's uh 11 there's like 29 games in total 11 of them are this Shire in The Wanderer series that you can like go back to the SNES to play uh and then there's there's Pokemon there's Pokemon roguelike games Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Series going back to 2005. yeah right right yeah like imagine imagine uh what we were doing in one way heroics but with Pokemon that's effectively what did that make it sway to America uh that's a great question uh yeah I don't know why it hasn't kind of Taken taken at least like or let me rephrase I guess I don't really know why it hasn't kind of climbed onto our radar but we're old men and you know we we uh maybe aren't the target audience for it and I don't know if it's like switch exclusive or things like that um but yeah like I was I was kind of surprised like wow it goes back to like so far and there's like there's seven Pokemon games that are like this one-way heroic style almost um so a lot to check out there uh there's there's a a big post uh on the jrpg subreddit by a person named Vash X Shanks uh that is just like I don't know 10 or 20 Pages worth of like you like RP jrpgs you like roguelikes here here's all of them basically and like it's control F Goldmine there uh other notable shout outs I guess the you know we we talked previously on shattered Pixel Dungeon this I feel one way heroics I feel is like a good intro to shattered Pixel Dungeon in a way like if you're more of like your standard console gamer you're like this game was fun but I think I'm looking for something deeper one way or a shattered Pixel Dungeon might be might be up your alley um a a stay tuned and a half is golden Crone hotel which is another solo Dev effort started as a seven day roguelike uh Game Dev Jam uh and as a game about you being a vampire and like switching between human and vampire form and having to avoid like beams of sunlight in this Castle it's pretty sweet um and yeah so maybe like I've got a bunch of other games on the list too but those are all for sure stay tuned uh that'll pop up at some point um yeah I think uh I think one way heroics is gonna finally land on on our aggregate rankings here at our number 10 out of 32 uh because as we all know will is gonna just inherit the average ranking uh the the special bonus of not being here and uh getting his homework done for him uh no emails this week but if you would like to write into the show you can do so at grogpodzone gmail.com you can uh see all of our all of our the posts of other things on the interwebs at uh grogpod at gamedev dot place on Mastodon uh our website where you can find all this other stuff is grogpod.zone um I think it's finally time for our next episode of finally doing our cataclysm dark days ahead going back to it we're going back we're we're approaching it with the proper amount of caution and respect and uh fear of the zombie oh yeah fear I think is is underlined and italicized uh for this upcoming game um yeah that'll that'll be interesting uh I've I've posted before about a developer interview that we did for or a few developer interviews that we did for cataclysm uh I'll post them again when we do that episode which we for sure will do this time we are not going to punt it off again yeah I mean even if even if we didn't get a lot of play time into it we'll still do it and and we'll just talk about how it was a hard game yeah to learn if that's if that's our takeaway if we if we try and do it twice and we can't do it then the takeaway is it's a hard game to get into but we've crossed the door Fortress Rubicon like we should we should be able to do it we should be able to do it and we hopefully won't encounter any of those darn carp those killer carp yeah and we can only hope uh well that's gonna be a heck of an episode uh will will probably be back hopefully his work dinners will finished with the two weeks time but who knows hey this work dinner could have been an email um

like three nights of Actuarial dinners versus playing a game that's arguably more obtuse than Dwarf Fortress I think he would probably go for the latter yeah uh but yeah that's gonna wrap up our one-way heroics uh episode uh I kind of hinted at it before but the the music for this game is a very interesting collection of free uh MIDI files from Japanese websites that that the developer curated into its own soundtrack which has uh gosh I don't know like I was I was listening to try to pick out the ones that I wanted for the uh for the end credit roll out to this episode like God there's like 120 of them there's like like so many and they're all so good so for for playing us out this week we're gonna get a special double feature we're normally I only play one but this time we're gonna uh play two back to back uh sounds that you will encounter in this game as long as they're not playing on the steam deck um which are first the tunes that greet you on your first Adventure out into the Prairies and then we'll Fade Into the climatic battle between our hero and the Dragon of darkness in MIDI form so keep that comp night company scroll ready at hand we'll see you next time
