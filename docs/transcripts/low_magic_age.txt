1:44
This week we're talking low magic age released January 10th 2017.
This is ironically our third 2017 year game in a row after Ward's Onancock - I think we're Kind of on a hot streak as well.
2:01
You can find low magic age on Steam and Gog, good old games.
This was developed by low magic Studios who as far as I can tell, I think, is a team of two people, but I think one guy basically did all the programming and well, I like okay there's a lot of writing in this game to that deserves credit but very is very small team with various artists credits as well, more stats.
2:29
Slow magic age, pulls in, on our stat sheet at the 186th, most popular Rogue like, are you kidding me on Steam?
That's what the data says.
I can't.
I can't argue with the numbers here. 2760 total reviews, and the 91st percentile in terms of popularity will Summary haven't, you have run afoul of some miscreants in the in the market and and you have to roll for initiative with the 17 districts description of what one does in low magic age.
3:04
Oh, it's a, it's D&D combat.
And that's about a shorter sentences.
You can make, because that's, that's, that's what it's supposed to be.
The whole game is just all of what is only D&D combat, like, are all the other, everything else trimmed away and then like a big open world where you wander around and do the same fucking thing over and over and over and over again specifically d and e 3.5 go, I don't know the details.
3:29
These two nerds over here they know more about the the DND world than I do but it's based off the 3.5.
Vo g l.
So it with some things modified and just for those who don't know, myself what that means, like versus like 3.5 open games license 3.5 is the one that was there was a right now.
3:48
The deity that's out that most people including your your other Two Hosts Scott and I we play 5e there was for you which is like the bastard child that everyone hated and then 3.5 was the like, super crunchy addition.
That was before that So that if you were from like what was it?
4:07
Two thousand, I think 3.5?
Wait, does this affect like the spells that are available?
Or like what happens when you have like initiative?
Like, I don't know, like what?
But the dice rolls, what are the subjects that the spreadsheets are bigger or the spreadsheets are bigger.
I don't know that.
4:24
How many I was almost half joking with that but then I remembered like, oh yeah, d and e is just a bunch of spreadsheets, isn't it?
I'm going to look, I mean, I love a good spreadsheet but I think in.
Okay, so There are like a thousand feets are like I can't remember where I need to find this list.
4:48
There's there's like hundreds and hundreds of Feats in 3.5 and in 5e there are not that many like I carry my characters are all humans.
It only had two feets, I don't know.
Hmm, ha ha ha no.
5:05
Technically you play blows.
It'll look like a robot monkey.
So you could have had more than two feet.
But I mean yeah back when I I tried the DND.
Yeah.
So so the first the first talking point that I have in my huge Google doc here is related to so we kind of talked that this is a dnp very much, a D&D game but I think like it probably Bears expanding on like, Like maybe game game D and D versus in like real life?
5:37
DND.
Is that worth expanding on?
Do we think?
Yeah, so I mean I think the biggest so maybe like okay well back a bit for, if you are one of the three listeners who has downloaded this podcast accidentally and you've never heard of what Dungeons & Dragons is before.
5:56
And you're wondering why we keep joking about spreadsheets and robot monks and Ice Wizards, like, what even is Dungeons and Dragons?
Normally, I guess, I mean, it's part of the tabletop role-playing genre likes the, the, the originator, our of most of them, you know, it is a world run and controlled by a literal human being handcrafting world for their players to run around in doing all the voices, being creative hand, sculpting the battles doing silly voices and you meant to running the combat, which is you like the Wizards, the Combat which is intrinsically.
6:46
Not that good, but you wrap it up with all the other fun stuff.
Any of a person like gently pressing on all the levers to make sure that it's a fun and interesting experience.
And then you have something like this which is imagine you took that mediocre combat and you got rid of all of the flavor And you just had mediocre combat, and it is interesting because like there are D and D, based games out there that are good.
7:18
Baldur's Gate is an amazing game, but I think that Baldur's Gate succeeds despite the DND combat system, not necessarily because of it like D and E.
Is built for humans, playing with other humans and spend.
7:39
It's like combat in normal DVD.
Takes a really long time, like people are talking and trying to decide things.
You get like three rounds of combat and then it's over because that's already taken an hour and a half, which is just, you couldn't, you could not do that for a video game and have it be interesting.
7:59
We're actually 46 people.
You're just like, yeah, I don't know. go hit that thing that's definitely going to be the best move and when you talk about combat in D and D it is basically just well like it's more than this but it is effectively just a bunch of grids and a lot of times you'll see like people will roll out like a giant thing of graph paper onto a table and there would be like little little miniature figures that are moving around and You have to position them and you have to make sure that you know, I don't want to get surrounded by rats or have this giant slime in case me and then I'm out of combat or something like that.
8:42
So there's like I guess like a reasonable tactical element to it well and I think the biggest difference between something like playing D&D with a DM and playing games like this is the the extras the things that are happening within combat.
8:59
But outside of it like hey I am, can I can can the Druid that transformed or that the bar that transformed into a dinosaur?
Can he pick me up in his mouth and throw me at the Flying Dragon?
Like, that's not even like yeah.
9:16
You know what?
That sounds fucking awesome.
Let's do it.
I'm gonna totally allow you to do that and, of course, that's in this game, too, because it's all combat Focus.
Right?
Of course.
Yes, that that's a mouth mouth row.
Dinosaur option.
You have to get the feet for.
9:32
It specifically though.
No, but like there's there's Like the things in normal, DND that make it.
Interesting are the the nuances and the stakes, the stakes of the battle are all.
There's almost always like a reason.
9:48
You're fighting a reason that you're doing something at least in modern DND.
I've read stuff.
Like, maybe the old like Gary, gygax addition one was just like they're just dungeon crawling and grinding for gold but that has not been my experience with d and e and the year of Our Lord 2023.
10:07
So low magic age is very interesting.
I think this game may have fooled us into covering it on a robe like podcast because I don't think there's anything particularly rogge about this game other than I guess grid-based movement question mark.
10:31
There's there's various elements that much like pornography, you know, Logan this in a game is like, you know, when you see it it's hard to Define but you know it when you see it be it procedural generation or permadeath or, you know, run based systems very few of which are integral to the gameplay experience here.
10:55
But I think this think low magic age is better.
Described under the genre of like a party-based RPG.
So maybe something like, like a Divinity, original sin, like a pillars of Eternity or possibly a Baldur's Gate game, but less of a focus on story, more of a focus on combat and I guess like, more, I think if you were like we've said earlier that this is basically just a DND combat simulator and I think It if you build it as such, I think it does what it says on the 10 pretty well.
11:36
But you know like calling you were saying D&D and IRL is so much more of like a an experience Beyond, just spreadsheets bumping into each other. yeah, and it's Like D and D is optimized for different thing.
11:57
Like it's optimized for people playing it in real life.
In real time interacting with each other like you wouldn't build a computer game with the same stuff in exactly the same way for the most part.
12:13
Like there's there's so many things that you can do with a computer that's super easy.
Like you can start getting into the weird nitty-gritty of like percentiles and extra things that if you're if you're trying to do stuff like that in real life Dandy it just it starts getting too bogged down.
12:30
And you know, you don't have time for like Oh Billy over there is gonna just he's going to spend the next half an hour trying to like optimize how he wants to put this on as his character or like.
Yeah, they're just counting dice.
I mean like that at some point that's just like I gotta keep rolling counting it does this wind is that win but I laughter offer this as like a way that maybe this, this could be cool if it had the chat GPT plug-in, right?
12:57
Are we talking like, as soon as like D&D like has like, this would be the visual game and then on the other side is just like you're in the middle of combat like, hey, can I can I have the dinosaur, like, throw me and then they chechi PJ's, like mmmm.
Well, I'm a DM and Yeah, I think that's cool.
13:13
So there you go.
Like let's do a roll for it.
I think that's right on the horizon but that's not this game.
Yeah and I think that it's definitely not this game as far as I could tell this game doesn't have a story.
No, it has like a tutorial which is just like to walk you through some of the main mechanics which felt like a story but is absolutely not and then it's just like it.
13:32
Once you get to the end of that and I know because I think out of all of us I played, I played it for like almost 20 hours.
I mean, I say played and I have a feeling I feel it needs to like you farm to those steam cards for 20 hours.
And I need to like, say that I really, guys, I didn't play it that much.
I just had it on the side of my screen.
13:48
I wasn't that involved in because it was just it was a really bad and I just kind of had on the side of my screen and most of the time it's just like an auto battler where if you just hit space and then everyone just kind of fights and your kind of liking, you know, what YouTubers were already there something like oh yeah, they look I won.
14:04
There we go, moving on.
I just kept hoping there would be something more in the game but somehow I made it to the end of 20 hours.
Without finding that.
Yeah, there's so there's there's I guess two major options that you have in this game.
One is the arena mode and then one is the adventure mode and I think if this game like what was it?
14:28
I was trying to do research badly badly on this game just to try to like dig up that mean you were trying to do research in a way that was not good or you were trying very hard.
I mean maybe a baby A mix of both for this case because like, this, this game, I think would benefit greatly from a, a Wiki.
14:51
So, but like, you could try to try to, like, grok more about what's happening.
But like, maybe the actual Wiki for this game is just the D & E, 3rd Edition rule book.
They just want to go go down your local game store and buy but but yeah, like doing the research for this game was super difficult because it was, it was Very hard to find any any active info about this game, other than like the steam forums, which I think are active, but weren't quite what I was looking for, in terms of, like, what do you do in this game?
15:25
What's all this stuff Arena, adventure mode and I guess maybe to a certain extent character-building, like if you just wanted to build out like a character sheet, which is super in depth, but Arena, we've Kind of touched on combat, DND style combat and the arena mode in this game is very much.
15:47
Just forget everything else.
This is just straight-up combat.
There is not even like a I guess I'm thinking of some some kind of story hook or something to like, draw you through like, well, why am I, why am I doing the arena mode?
16:06
Exactly what I do?
Not touch it at all.
What level characters do you have in it?
Can you build any level character, character?
Level building in this game is super weird and fresh needlessly frustrating.
I think Arena mode.
16:22
Let's see, if I remember, I think you you start with like a pre-generated party of six that I think are all.
Ones.
But you like you start in various like, phases of the arena, and like, your first phase is fighting level 1 monster.
So it's even footing.
But when you start up a game here and you just jump into Arena mode, you have like random dudes, you can, you can build your own party from characters that you've created or you can you can like swap people in and outside like you have reasonable levels of flexibility there.
16:55
But the thing that I found Super Fresh like me Needlessly frustrating.
So was jumping into a D&D game.
The first thing, first thing I wanted to do was, well, obviously I'm going to recreate rd&d party that we have and send them on all sorts of Wacky Adventures in this game and then I kept scratching my head when I was like, okay, well, why is it not letting some of these characters in?
17:19
There's a thing, I don't know if this is, so this might be a third addition.
Rule thing, there's a zillion house rules in this game.
Just tweaks it ever so slightly so that it uses low magic age house, rules of well like monster bonuses, every two levels, use blah and the the super frustrating one is where if you build a character it's level and it's a level adjustment is what it is.
17:49
So I built out a, a paladin, I guess, human because giant, the giant option was available.
Table tried to build out what lash and he started off as like a level 1 plus 1 and then same thing with he'll foreign who I also couldn't get to be chaotic evil for some reason.
18:11
He could like Paladin's can only be lawful good in this game which anyway Third Edition stuff.
Yeah.
I mean you used to like if you stop to being good or lawful I can't raise either lawful good or one of those combinations.
You did you be like Can't be a paladin anymore you just get kicked out of being a paladin.
18:32
I guess.
Like to balance that out I did set.
He'll Thrones character Avatar as like one of these like devilish cool characters.
My okay.
Well, at least it's like halfway there, but trying to like build the characters.
And I'm like, okay got all of our characters Bill, I've got on burial in there, I've got Odom, I've got a sweet girl.
18:54
These are all the members of the party in our DNA.
D campaign.
So and I was like, all right set forth what started venturing and then it was like I can't do it.
You know some of these people in your party or too high of level.
I'm like what what are you talking about?
19:10
I just made them depending on certain character traits.
Like oh actually, this Paladin here is level 2 to start off with, or this troll character, that you build, shimmy couldn't be, you know, a walking artificial sentience suit of armor had to be a troll in this game.
19:27
Fortunately, sorry.
Jimmy but started off at level 7 and I guess like, yeah, exactly.
I understand the game balance being totally broken.
If you have like a level 7 troll in your party to start with and you're just clubbing, people into the ground.
19:45
But come on, man.
I mean, like, that's got to be the first thing that people are going to do in the pick up this game is like I want to make my DND party and I want to send them on Wacky Adventures.
What?
I didn't want to make a DN by D and D party.
The time that I don't play that.
But like I went for the trolls to I went, I went for six trolls, right away.
20:02
I'm like it's been 30 minutes handcrafting.
These trolls with these very specific traits, I'm like yes, six trolls, how much fun is this going to be?
And then I got to that, like start and it's just, I can't, sorry, I can't allow you to do that because you're too high level.
20:18
I'm just like, why didn't you tell me that before I spent 30 minutes on?
Like so things, it's so frustrating.
You can't even get those trolls.
Well, to the game's credit.
Edit, you can turn that off.
There is in the house rules section.
That's like a mile long list of like constitutional legal.
20:36
He's right.
You're right.
I read.
But you could, but then you're just overpowered.
They don't have it.
They don't have the ability to balance the game towards that starting carrot like auto level scaling, or something.
Can't start out with our baby troll.
Start everyone with like either, yes, our everyone else at level 7 or like start like you know Nerf the trolls until I don't know.
20:53
That's all I wanted was a troll people so thoroughly diaper.
So, yeah.
So Arena mode.
You can you can build up your party from, like, the character creation stuff.
They all have to be.
21:08
Well, you know, again, if you turn that rule off, you can jam them all together and put them into a n by n grid of squares, where some of the squares are difficult to rain and you can't maneuver around a rock or something, but it is a series of five fights with one boss battle at the end and you have options to like level up and rest between hand You can visit a shop like seems pretty pretty well crafted.
21:35
If if the only thing that you were interested in was I just want to go in and I just want to fight some monsters in a DND ruleset, you're done, you got kind of everything you need.
But as I was going through this, I wanted to I wanted to test a couple things.
21:55
I wanted to test a how broken Summoners were and be how far And the the huge oversight are are in real life.
D&D party get on Just Auto battle mode and who would make it further.
So, I had a race between the Summoner is and like the the first wave that I did, I put all the summoner's on auto attack, which is not auto spell by the way.
22:20
That's, that's a big thing.
Yeah, and they got they got clobbered after maybe like three of the easiest rounds unsurprisingly.
I did another Play through with Alzheimer's where I first summoned, all the Elementals, and then hit the autorun button and they got further, but I think they still did not get past the first boss or no.
22:42
The they be they beat the wave one boss, but they lost the next immediate round after that the huge oversight party was defeated by the wave one boss.
So unsurprisingly are in real life.
The Indy party.
Probably not as powerful as a clan stack of all Summoners who need to spend all their gold to rest in between fights but Arena mode.
23:07
Yeah, is kind of like 85% of the cord game here.
I think just in terms of its functionality and what else is kind of going on and the other 15% of the adventure mode game is Like procedurally generated dungeons.
23:28
Which is just a series of fights, but also picking locks finding traps and traps, Nazi trap using the traps.
That's the literally.
Those are the three things that happen in a dungeon is you enter a room in?
There are monsters.
23:43
You go down a hallway and there's a trap that you search for and you either find her, do not find and then you try and defuse that trap.
Or there's like a chest in a wall.
Hmm.
And that's, I mean, I guess I didn't do that many but that's all I found.
Yeah, that's that's all there is.
24:00
There's no, like you go into a room and you like, I look what's in this room?
It's like it is a grey square box with a picture of a, of a helmet.
I think.
Yeah, helmet.
Yeah.
And then, if you had already beat some monsters in there, it's like some monsters with her ex over them.
24:20
So what's interesting here?
Here is darkest.
Dungeon came out a year before this game and admittedly the game darkest dungeon very well-regarded roguelike has lots of dungeon diving and I thought it felt similar here but profoundly less interesting because there's just like not as much like stuff and in darkest dungeon your kind of navigating through like these maze-like corridors in a Fashion.
24:51
But there's like there's encounters around the corner, like I don't know.
Like if you feel like it very much sense of foreboding and dreaded like, okay do I want to push my luck going down this hallway a little more.
Oh hey, there's like a thing to interact with.
Okay, here, I was very disappointed to see that it's only traps or only.
25:11
Is it only traps that you encounter in hallways traps and chests traps and chest.
Okay.
And you have to pick pick them regardless so they get you click a button that just says.
I mean it's just a really a You just had an auto clicker, you take you through the whole dungeon.
I mean yeah.
But like that kind of procedural.
25:30
Like pop down dungeon maze navigation.
I had high hopes for because I was like well darkest dungeon kind of doesn't a similar matter.
I'm curious to see what here is be, right.
It's just like literal empty rooms.
Where it's not even like equipment or like more drops or anything about the world.
25:51
And I talked to that up at first back, okay?
It's procedural generation.
The world is procedurally generated question mark, so it's probably hard to like, get all those things to line up.
It's but I think the thing is, I think this game is fundamentally not finished like it's been an early access since 2017 and it is technically An Early Access.
26:14
I like you can go look at the development priorities from the dev.
It's basically I want to get every single combat thing done.
Done perfectly before I even start on the campaign.
And I think that it's a game, that's not finished masquerading as a game that's playable.
26:32
Like it's, it's a, some, it's someone who is Effectively recreated that moderately okay d and e 3.5 e, combat simulator and then built the thinnest of shell.
26:51
The thinnest skin of a world in which to go fight monsters and no political reason to do so.
Well I can give you a like okay I can give you some some of the details for like what that looks like, which is like not much because Actually finished all the political Campaign which is essentially, it guides you to make sure, you know, how to cut down trees because this is an element that we haven't talked about is trees and Mining and then like crafting some of the stuff, all right, IMA get them talk about my look, so incredibly boring.
27:25
That once I looked it up, I was like, I can't imagine even doing this once, right?
And like you, so, you need some trees you because you needed wood, and you have to mind, like, there's a whole bunch.
There's all kinds of diversity of things, but like the This is you have to like you pay for the rights to a mine.
27:41
You go into it and then you highlight some rocks and then your dude just kind of goes over there and automatically Minds them and mines, it all out.
And then those are percent chance that you like my nothing or not.
And so I guess in some ways like a RuneScape sort of like, you know, experience where you're just like, yep.
I'm going to sit here and wait for you to finish mining, all this stuff and then like it, once you get all the stuff though it's just like everything is a percent chance of failure and you suck at the beginning are so you suck pretty much all the way through.
28:07
Like I'm pretty sure.
The level system and all the mining and all the crafting is like very much not focused on at all because there's like a 17%, you're like at the beginning, like a 17% chance that you make, like the item that you want.
And if you want to make a really nice stuff, it was like a one percent chance a zero percent chance.
28:22
I'm just like I didn't actually calculate it out but I'm guessing it be something like 20 hours of just grinding through Mining and order to like have a good chance of getting like a high-end item but you just come across the high-end items while you're like fighting stuff naturally.
So it's just like why would anyone go through all the effort to just to get this stuff in the most boring way is like there's no balance to it whatsoever.
28:45
And it's just like the most boring mechanic Conceivable.
It's the classic more things is not better like a dam or systems to your game.
Add more objects, add more items, add more, playable races.
29:01
It's like at a certain point.
One more thing is a detriment to your game, even if it's a good thing.
Like, it's just more complicated, more clutter and these are not good things.
It's like this person has no idea like about game design.
29:17
And like, how like you, like, Cool.
T and challenge curves.
And like feels like, they're like, oh, we're stuck, like, crafting.
That's a thing that we're supposed to have in games.
That's the third is what it feels like.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you should be able to get my like, oh we should probably implement some sort of economy.
29:33
How about you go to towns and of random things on sale and you buy that and you go to a different town and sell it for slightly more money?
It's like, that's not fun games have quests.
Let's put some question.
What do people quest for?
And that was the other thing is like, so in addition to like, Get someone who can mine and smells are Mike mine and craft is like the main like Guild like Quest thing.
29:54
Then it was also, once you're done with all that, like just go out adventuring is like Quest and like you go to a town or whatever and they like have a bar and I'll have like four different things.
It's just like, yeah.
Go to this nearby thing and kill a thing or like take this person to that thing and it's just like, kind of the traditional, like sort of.
30:11
Like, you know, escort missions kill the things missions.
And so you go and you do the thing, you come back and they pay you a little bit of And it's just like, okay, that's the game.
Like your game is to go from town to town to town like kind of Witcher.
Ask style, let me solve your problems and then you, there's almost nothing that comes a bit.
30:30
Like, there's no, the game doesn't develop like the world doesn't Advance.
There's no meta progression.
It's just here's something to do that.
That, you know, it's just kind of like a.
Here's a very slight reason to do anything whatsoever and that always felt like for me, the fun was always was the hardest level of thing that I can.
30:48
Fight right now and let me just give me some Challenge and so I test like can I go into the level 10 thing when I have like level 5 dudes?
No no you can't answer that.
No Potter level 3 thing and I'm just like doodoo doodoo didn't realize.
31:08
It was a little through, thought it was level 2 and then like, oh no, by all my people are dead.
Yep.
I lost four out of six people.
And the last was just like, I had four people surrounding one bad guy shipping away.
While it just was like it did it did and I'm just like I can't I think I'm going to lose because I'm doing one percent damage with every hit and I were like you guys missed it.
31:33
Yeah, that was okay.
And that was a big problem.
So and what's interesting about that too is like sure.
Like you can you can get like, pummeled to death and like a big cum, a big component of row Blake's is death and like, okay, like you lose your stuff that's great.
31:53
I've like progressed in some sort of fashion to advance a thing maybe but here, I don't think there's anything like that, where it's like in Like invisible ink or like an XCOM like game, you know, your dudes get brutalized and they're dead.
32:09
Oh no, but you know, you've made advancements in some sort of meta progression to like oh no I can go and replace them with dudes from this tavern near by but like if they if they're dead I'm guessing they've lost all their equipment to and oh, no that's not.
32:26
There's no there's no permanent you go to town, he's pay a small fee and anyone who was dead.
Comes back for a really supportive lie.
You only have two people left and you can't carry all the gear.
All right, it's on your other down party members and so you have to start throwing away valuable items like your plate mail because it's too heavy.
32:45
So you can drag your friends corpses back to the town to revive them has would a ISM.
Is it large missing component of low magic age?
I mean, I think like there's there's an interesting thing about the adventure.
33:03
Which pretty clearly is unfinished but I think has potential in that a if it was procedurally generated, like if it was different every time and if there was some long-term, like what's my goal that I'm reaching for like those are kind of like the bare minimum things that we need to attach to.
33:21
But like, I was thinking through, like, well, what's like, what's something that would like, really help to elevate the adventure mode and really kind of like ring this to be a much more.
Fully fleshed-out product, would the adventure mode in this game be like suited well, from like a worsse mesk like back end to it.
33:46
II was just thinking, like, what?
Like the if the Epic narrative, which is been the most successful of all time as save the world and it's like Lord of the Rings where I like the start of the game is like essentially the orc Invasion.
Oars.
And like, and now like they're on the Overworld, you can actually actively see.
34:03
Advancing.
And so your job is to like push them back and like to actually use some kind of strategy with like, you know, helping set up defenses in certain places and like just and then the tactically getting in there and actually like winning some of the actual fights.
I can see how that might work but I feel like the combat is okay is merely fine.
34:26
It's not an I've noticed that.
Yeah yeah it is it is a moderately complimented Competently implemented combat system, and I don't think that we have enough information to judge whether or not a adventure mode would be good.
34:47
It's as like, they're so little work that has been done on it. that it's It's it's the same as if you just give a random person like write me a story.
I don't know.
35:02
It's probably.
Is it going to be good to have?
Absolutely, no way of knowing.
This person could be a could write Beautiful video game, poetry the finest game of all time and they just haven't started doing it yet.
Look, I don't know because there's no There's nothing that has been put in to suggest one way or the other is just a, it's a hollow shell.
35:26
Yeah, I remember when we were playing through War Sim like one thing that was kind of lost on me for that game was like, being able to like, see see like the world and my place in it, and to some degree, there's a little bit of that in there.
This almost feels like the complete opposite end like okay, I can see the world, like, I see my place in it but and like, literally nothing else is happening.
35:46
Yeah, which is a shame because like I feel Feel I feel like the item or the location descriptions in this game or super cool.
And like, would want me to be like, yes, I would love to explore the five Elders Boneyard, or the shadow mine, or the archmage is altar or the never night Radha, like these all sound, like really awesome locations.
36:12
They're all like, for example, call Anvil, there is a place called Colin bill that were chattin.
These are all, like, and and Lake are all those.
They're all the same.
Yeah.
Like that's that's the really disappointing thing is like, going to the stone giants Mausoleum, and it's just going to be the exact same workflow of like gray squares connected with like smaller gray squares.
36:34
To each other.
Click, OK.
Explore that room, whose monster go fight them in this like 50 by 50 grid.
And, you know, you have your like your Tactical fight in there.
But like to what end like in service of what?
What's like the old.
Ultimate goal that I'm doing this for other than to fill all of your item slots because you.
36:54
Yeah, it's a, it's actually incredibly.
I was very curious.
That's actually what kind of, what got me into the first like five hours.
It's like, okay.
I've been like, my guys are like, leveling up but like, I still have a helmet for all my dudes.
Like I don't have like an amulet like yeah, it's crazy how long that took to like get that stuff and so that was my goal for a long time, which is like, can I get to some base level stuff?
37:13
Like, I don't even like, I don't we play Diablo for a beta over the weekend and it's funny how Current.
That is because you start off with like a couple things but then like immediately everything gets filled up and you're constantly getting new stuff, too.
Like my place it and like that's I mean like that's what Diablo is.
It's like a loop game essentially but like they could have learned a little bit about where the reward schedules and how does create something addictive by implementing some of the learnings from Diablo because they've definitely mastered that but that's that's not the way D&D works and that's one of the things like G and D, isn't a lute generator.
37:48
You find your rewards in other places and the ends, you make a long way and like the battle system does not fundamentally does not have room.
Like, the best thing that you can get is like plus 3.
38:07
So you've got three, three increments of rewards and like you go from a D6 to ad8 worth of damage and like That's it.
That's the entirety of the increase.
Like you've run out, you've run out of, you've got four possible options for a sword maybe a little bit more, maybe it's like oh you can add a little bit extra damage or something else but like their the room to scale is just not there and that's fine for D and D because you are getting better at other things and it's not really about the combat.
38:42
It's about the journey and if you don't have a journey, The combats not enough.
And this is like, if this game is built as a DND combat simulator, I feel like there needs to be more like like there needs to be more with that right of like right now.
39:05
It's just a DND fight through five levels of monster simulator.
It's not even so much of like, okay, I'm going to put shimmy versus MBA real in a one-on-one combat against each other and hit the Auto Battle.
Button and see who comes out on top.
Like that could be cool.
39:21
But in this, it's like, literally just okay.
I'm going to like, create a party of my people and fight against the computer, which I guess is fine, but I'm thinking of something like, I'm sure neither of you have played totally accurate battle simulator before.
39:36
Yes.
Okay.
So like that's like the silly, like goofy version of what I'm thinking of where like you have scenarios of like deer are like three Summoners.
And And, you know, you have like five Warriors.
You got to figure out like the Tactical positioning to like beat them and solve the puzzle.
39:53
Basically, that would be more interesting.
I was going to ask like Colin because you set up like all of our D&D stuff for us like is there is there like a non Lo magic Aid, d and e, combat simulator, that you reference, when you're sit like theorizing about combat encounters like okay.
40:13
Maybe I'll put 5 lava Spirits over here and put like three water's.
Add Water guys over here.
Now, that's already too many enemies is too slow.
You guys fight like two things because it's like hard to run many.
40:29
Many monsters to like everything in my mind for D and D is about streamlining combat as much as possible and making it feel epic like and feel like a cool thing, maybe making up new mechanics that are entirely unrelated to like, Like making up mechanics is what makes the fights fun.
40:57
Like okay cool, you've got the base system now, what if the bad guy could just make the floor, ice will shoot love out of the ground?
Like, these are things that are outside of the, the base system.
And like, that's what spices up.
The combat.
Just throwing a couple more goons in there.
41:15
All it does.
Is there glow?
Yeah.
It just slows combat down.
And that's I guess, fine.
And if you're just You're treating it as an auto battler, which as always, a bad sign for your video game.
If I'm having more fun by let it just like watching my guys go and fight then true.
41:36
DOTA.
Okay, that's fair.
It's a great game.
You're right.
You're right.
It's about it's a bad sign, though.
If I can't be bothered to click through the beginning of it, it's all just Auto Battle until I get into position because it was like it's too much work to move all these people, right?
41:53
Well, I mean like there's there's something there was for me like, as that extreme Optimizer like I want to know like what is the perfect combination.
Obviously, I went to extreme with all the trolls, I couldn't do that.
And so, and after I like losing a couple times, just letting my guys all die.
Not worried about I'm like, okay, obviously Summoners are the best but like you have to have some like you have to have a one-guy to tank because if you get in a small room and they just walk up to you, right away your summer and are is just like it wiped.
42:18
And so for Summoners one fighter and then one cleric and I'm pretty sure that's like the best set scenario so you make sure to get in the initiative Buffs on all your Summoners.
So that way the very first they have a higher chance of going.
First you cast for some and summons and they just go out and then you that's when you You hit space and even though you can apply more Magic on a higher level dudes, if you need to like get a little extra lightning or something on them, you just sit back then and then it all plays out.
42:44
But that's that was a pretty sure the optimal strategy for all four like 90% of fights.
And then for that, last 10% we get a hard.
But dude, you just drop the rest of your magic on them.
And that was always fun.
Because you can always just like, rest if you need to or like leave the dungeon, like if you're like deep in the dungeon, it's like there's no penalty at all.
43:00
To just leave the dungeon sit on top of it.
Rest for the night, go back in and resume.
Yeah.
I have two final small Notes.
One music was surprisingly good.
Oh okay.
Yeah, continue with I actually thought the music was pretty good and it got stuck in my head today and I was I thought it was in congress with Everything else like it's like, oh, this music is like not, not too shabby at all you to get annoyed by like the the singing woman, just constantly with the high pitch, you know, whining almost like, you know why the music is so good.
43:35
I don't know why it uses the same music as War sin.
In some parts in some part A so serious.
Yeah I was just I was like subscribe to the YouTube channel.
Will see that I uploaded a video for sound editing purposes later of like sampling from the the battle music.
43:59
So there's like a not another house or option that you can set of like you know make sure to turn on like epic battle music for normal fights or something.
And I was like you know like The, the music that you have playing at like the start of the main menu and I think for the main over world in the adventure mode is pretty good.
44:18
And it's exactly what you would think of for an indie Fantasy game setting.
And then I'm like, look, listening through the boundaries of Mike.
Why is the sound so familiar?
I've heard this before somewhere.
Surely it is the it's one of the sound sound track pieces from were Sim.
44:38
That is like and it We're Sam, it's like like the super low bit like 8-bit version of it that I think.
Okay.
Yeah.
They have like put through like a like da Trav converter to put the game to me to meet like the criteria but like I was like, oh my God, this is just, it's this exact.
44:58
It's the exact exact same music from Morrison.
And these days there are two sides of the same coin they are.
I think our rankings will will kind of bear that out.
A little bit.
But but yeah, like and I'm like, okay, like surely they did not rip off from Warson.
45:18
I'm pretty sure they both independently went to the same free.
Like like royalty, free music website, to like go and get it, but I thought it was really funny that like, it was it's much higher quality in this game, but like it almost sort of felt encapsulating or like emblematic of this game in general, like This game like feels very high quality, it like it pretty bug-free.
45:42
As far as I can tell like playing around with it interface generally very nice and clean but like it doesn't it doesn't have that Soul like it all to it which is the exact opposite from Orson.
We're like you have the same music, combining two of those really more.
45:59
Same is also too much, so maybe.
Yeah.
Best game also, no Bobby, it's just a disembodied soul.
Somebody gambling simulator is my other note is, is he's advancing and Magic.
Which is the, you have to pre-select, how many spell slots you want, or?
46:19
How many spells you want for each spell?
And I feel like just having spell slots, is it objectively better way of doing it?
And I'm glad the five he does that and fantasy and magic isn't used in games anymore.
It makes me feel like I'm just for, I am in a Transit quarter, and this makes me horny.
46:38
Word spells even harder.
And I just found that I wouldn't use spells because what if I need to use the spell of it another time, I don't like it now I was just dropping someone's and like you never you never run out because you can always just rest whenever you need.
46:56
So I never felt like I didn't have I probably just didn't get far enough in the game to do summons I summoned.
Like one thing That's fair enough.
You, I mean, if I was wise, I would have been done after like a few hours cuz then I put in 4 hours now.
Yeah.
You're the wisest of us then and that was about the like, yeah, you know, I feel like I've gotten my time is worth out of this.
47:20
I don't want to play anymore.
Well, do we want to do?
We want to move on to rankings next chirps?
I want to apologize though for, for like, having picked this or like, I mean, I was fooled.
I think I mean, like they're what way.
We all love.
47:35
We were, we were all fooled.
It looks like it looks like it's going to be into the breach or like it looks like a tactical game like that's what I was like, oh look there.
You know, you know Wars him was very much like not that as you know very story or whatever and like here we go tactics and so I just I didn't do enough research and so that was my bad.
47:51
I didn't know if it was going to be good but I was excited to try it out.
Yeah it's like oh cool fun D&D simulator with no story like who would have thought?
So I expected it to have like a generic.
Fantasy story which I gotta save that princess.
48:07
I can, I can do that.
Like, all the demons are invading, they stole the princes.
Go get the princess back.
Okay, fine sure justjust give me a generic anime, generic fantasy.
I'll play it.
I I have it.
48:25
I'll go first.
I have it.
Is that 13 out of 16?
It's below.
It's a valley without wind is my number eleven one.
And that is the cutoff for games that I actually played and didn't just wash out of.
48:45
So, it is below the threshold of I didn't want to play this game anymore and I just don't I just Yeah, I there's more stuff to do but I don't want to play it would not recommend, maybe maybe if they can finish the game eventually, it'll be worth looking at again.
49:03
But I like five years into Early Access.
I feel like I'm doubtful.
Hmm.
Yeah, I guess, I'll go next.
Yeah, like I was, I was Hoodwinked by this game because like, oh, it's got like really great reviews.
49:21
All the reviews say hello, if you like the Indy, you'll like this game.
But all the stuff that I like about D&D in real life aren't here in terms of like zaniness in terms of like combat, I feel like is interesting when Colin does it because it's in service of something, right?
49:41
It's advancing something like oh, like Like because we win this combat will be able to do X Y and Z but here it's like the combat is the draw and I don't I think it's like backwards incentive wise.
So I think like this game and it's a shame because like everything else about the game is competently done.
50:01
Like the interface is clean.
Like there's a zillion rules but like it's easy to like scroll like find them in scroll through and like figure out, okay?
Like all the stuff it is very clear, how you build a character.
There's a lot.
Of complexity.
I think in the DND world that you can get overly Bamboozled by and I think that this game does a good job of like hey I just want to jump in.
50:22
I just want to like create five Sorcerers in like 30 seconds and go on adventures with them.
Boom boom, boom, boom, boom.
You're done like able to do that or if you want to like really finely tuned.
Bespoke them.
You can do that too.
I think it does a good job.
The art I think is okay.
50:40
I think it's serviceable for the most part.
But it's not overly offensive.
The opposite side of the coin, I think is stay tuned for sure Tales of module, which is not the prettiest looking game has like a very obtuse interface but I think is 5,000 percent more fun than this game.
51:01
So for me I'm putting this behind dins curse and above Hack Slash include for my 14th at a 17th ranked game.
I kept thinking, like, man, like dins curse.
51:17
Just like, literally has about the same amount of like, nothing happening.
But it's so much more fun to play because it's just complete Insanity the whole time and there's no like ten foot tall.
Super leprechauns that you fight in this game, which is a big Miss.
51:32
So so so I think it is it is well housed in that like Oh for how ugly didn't curse is, it's a lot more fun versus something.
That looks a lot better with low magic age but is significantly less fun because of all those other systems.
51:52
Yeah, I mean you're going to find me agreeing with you all for once here.
I think I didn't say for once we tend to agree on a lot of these but yeah, a little magic age, I have my out of 10 system, which I converts it to rank, but out of 10 I give it a 4 in my threshold.
52:07
For like a recommend is like a Least a 6 or above and so it's Falls.
Well below the recommended level and like just to put it in comparison with some of the other games.
Yeah didn't curse.
I give a 4.5.
I did think didn't curse was better.
I thought what I have here is were so evaluate without wind of course, the worst game but cargo commander and hack hack slash and loot.
52:30
I also said were a slightly worse.
So this game ends up being 12 on my list out of the 17 because I thought those games were Or I mean, at least this one, I could sit there and watch the auto battler or like, do some other things, it didn't force my attention and I could just be like, oh, tune in.
52:46
Here we go.
There's something happening.
Okay, click away and so, yeah, it's just not, it's not a fun game.
I don't play it and at least not now, and hopefully they can make some in some of these improvements.
Some of these include suggestions were making although they're pretty fundamental large changes for the most part I realized that I had to number two games.
53:07
So now it's down to number 14, out of 17.
So supposing rankings fast gonna clean up that garbage data.
Well, I have three, I have three that are tied for third place.
And so, like when I say 12, I mean, really, it's like that's why the rank.
53:23
I don't know why we can't just switch this out of 10 system.
That's a much better system.
We got to normalize it somehow, I think, I think the rank makes more sense than a out of 10 score, but But I can't tell you, which one has a higher rank between like these three that are at like Rank 3.
53:38
I mean, ultimately it doesn't actually matter.
It doesn't matter.
Yeah.
But usually bad that bad but yeah, 10,000 years from now, when when aliens are uncovering, this podcast and they're like, there's still no not to play a little magic and they should play comprehend.
Yes, that is an objective fact.
53:55
Well yeah, it's debatable, but But yeah, that's gonna do it for low magic age episode.
If you want to get in touch with the show, you can email us at Grog pods own at gmail.com.
Will read your letter on the air.
54:11
There's only so many YouTube comments that we could we could fit into one episode.
So Mastodon guard pug, Grog POD at Game Dev dot, plays, and our website where we have all of our rankings and previous shows, and all that good stuff.
Growing pot Zone.
Our next episode is not a Swindle episode is a verified solid good one.
54:32
We're dealing a bundle episode on both the hand of Fate game.
So we're will be covering hand of Fate One and hand of Fate to which I'm very excited about a moment.
I keep desperately trying to beat the final boss of hand of Fate One.
54:48
I'm just like I could move on ahead of a to at any time I could do it but I'm so close and it just got real.
But I haven't played either, so, I'm excited.
And I played too and I thought it was a great game.
So I'm looking forward to refreshing on that, and then playing the first one, indeed.
55:05
Well, let's give it a hand for low magic age.
As we as we very dutifully transition to the end of the program with a solid segue out of the show with more explanation as to the fact that is the end of the show.
55:24
We'll see you next will say.
Well, wait, wait, wait, I'll see you next time in the I don't know if that's a good one.
Well, workshop at.
All right, great hand, hand Faith to next time dungeons, stop recording.
