Greetings friends, and welcome to another episode of the going Road gaming podcast a podcast about roguelike games.
I'm your host of The Grog pod, someone who's seen diamonds cut through harder men, Scott Burger. and as always, I'm joined with my Rogues gallery of joint, snapping co-hosts This is your miraculously dodging, bullet agents will right?
1:13
And this is Colin a combo machine punching people just in the face over and over again until they die.
Today, we're talking the roguelike game fights, in tight spaces released December 2nd 2021.
1:30
You can find it on Xbox steam Gog, the epic game store and this was a game that was developed by ground shatter games based in Bristol.
United Kingdom, they had also developed some other game called Rico London.
1:45
That I haven't really looked at that much into but after finding out that they are uk-based Deb's, I think a lot of the stuff in the He makes makes a little more Regional sense about why we things in pounds and special agents and all that.
Yeah, it was very more, it felt more MI6 than CIA, very much, more more Bond than born.
2:07
Yes.
This price in tight spaces, fits comes in at the 259 most popular roguelike in our data set, with 2125 total reviews in the 93rd percentile Colin, You have.
2:24
Gwen sentence of momentum to use to describe this game before Steven, Seagal is Gonna Come and Ninja Kick you off the stage.
I mean, you mean just barely push me off the stage.
It is a deck-building card based game.
2:44
That uses cards for tactics.
It's a it's a tactics game, but using deck building cards. which is also say there's some element of position to it, and Well I mean it's like so I mean tactics in the like that old school like Advance Wars tactics or Final Fantasy Tactics where you've got the the squares and you move you a little pieces around.
3:15
I see I was as I realized as I was saying it that it was a word that had a broader meeting lost context.
Well I mean it's tactics in like your kind of standard turn-based tactics in a way right.
3:31
I mean, would Colin did you ever play into the breach?
I forget I didn't and I don't know why I didn't, I am 100% sure that I would like it a lot.
Yeah, I mean this game is you can buy it right now.
Well I mean there is a steam Spring sales coming up.
3:50
Pretty soon I hate saving money.
You've come to the right place if you're listening to this podcast.
So fights and tight spaces, I think.
Be accurately.
Described as into the breach meets slay, the Spire.
4:06
Does that sound right into the Spire sleigh tonight?
Yeah.
I mean like - The Narrative aspect of it, that's almost 100% right right on what it is.
Yeah, but this is also just also the aspect of like the the other key difference being that you're controlling one player unit as opposed to a team of dudes, which is something that you might even say it's mixed in with invisible ink in that sense.
4:31
Yeah, it's like had six people.
Well, up to up to six people and into the breach.
I think you had teams of four if I recall correctly but in this game you just play as the one dude or the one.
Gal, if you depending on which character you choose you know this is not an actual good comparison but in some ways it reminded me of superhot in terms of just like the aesthetic style but also in that you're like super hot.
4:58
You are almost it's not turn-based but you have time to think and you have time to like plan Not all of your moves and you're trying to like skirt around stuff and keep it from from happening to you.
And then also, the Aesthetics, that the game is a pretty strong reminder, the white background, you know, white and gray background, and then the mono color enemies, and really stylized manner.
5:26
Definitely a unique art style.
I have to figure out when did other side come out.
So there's another roguelike game.
That's very black, white and red, similar to Fitz.
5:43
Let's see, other side with Asus on Guide to the Chili Peppers.
No, I don't think the Red Hot Chili Peppers had a giant anime Sword, but I don't know.
I haven't really listened to their music a little while.
This game came out.
Let's see.
Other side, came out, July 27th, 2020, so beat it.
5:59
It fits by a year almost but yeah like superhot very very striking minimalist aesthetic art style.
Yeah other side also kind of similar.
Very black, white and red.
Kind of God what's that comic book movie?
6:20
Then I'm thinking of YMCA City.
Yeah, gives me kind of Vibes that.
But yeah, like I feel the artists attic here.
Works really well just with its simplicity.
Where you have, it's very clear who you are and who the enemies are.
6:39
You know, I say that, your you say that I did find it annoying that like in isn't like the fifth level when they started introducing enemies that were also black.
I mean it didn't actually make it hard for me to see who I was, but I noticed it and it bugged me.
There were a couple enemies were black like black shaded and way.
7:01
Yeah, like what?
Like stylized in the Ways your player character is right?
Yes, not not African-American the color.
Used to represent them was black.
Yeah.
And that's the same color that used to represent your player character and up until that point, all the other people are of different color than you.
7:22
Yeah.
So so I think this game, this game starts very, very interesting Lee where I think other, I don't know, other kind of like, Well, also, this game is kind of very unique in the sense that we've had a tactical like character action game with gosh, we just said it the basically.
7:49
Yeah, with invisible ink and maneuvering like very positionally dependent, but obviously, more based around kind of, like action points instead of using cards, think this is the first, like, actual like, Quote unquote like a traditional deck builder game that we've that we've played thus far because stack lands I think sacraments is such a weird Beast that.
8:12
Yeah, it's not.
I wouldn't call it a deck builder because you're not you're not building a deck in our drawing from a deck.
Right?
But so yeah, I guess like walking through the setup here, you are a secret agent for Section 11, you are agent 11, it will shaking his head and And you start off by by talking with your briefing agent about we need to send you on the secret mission and then U you pick out a deck based on well, the first deck that you have is just here is like, your kind of basic stuff to get used to the game, your standard kicks and punches and Dodges, and things to get out of the way.
8:54
But later on, you, you unlock other kinds of decks be them more, sort of countering decks, things that Are more defensive related things that are more kind of offense related.
Willed in your 30 plus hours of playtime.
9:11
Did you wind up unlocking?
All the decks?
Yes I believe.
So.
Is there any one of them that seems like way better than all the rest of them or do they seem reasonably balanced between each other?
I I never used it.
I always did the card.
What was the option?
9:27
Like you said?
The drafting mode?
The drafting mode.
Yeah.
Like I just felt like I didn't want to.
I looked at like what?
Was in each of those decks.
I'm just like these are shit.
I'd rather just have the ability to pick, and I think that always turned out better.
Hmm.
Yeah, I think you're wrong.
I didn't I, I can't take so long to play that.
9:43
I never really played it enough times to know if there's a real strong difference for deck-building.
I feel like are for this style of death.
Building the momentum deck building.
Where you're you're you're gaining cards throughout it and it's not like magic where if you draw through your deck, you lose drafting is Is Opie because sometimes you want to have very few cards like having seven.
10:10
Really good cards is better than having 14 mediocre cards because then you get to play those good cards more often.
Yeah.
But unless I'm mistaken like, you should you still have to have the same size deck when you start, it's just a matter of you, choose one of three over and over again to fill the same capacity of cards.
10:26
Whereas, the other ones are preset sort of templates where you get a certain like set of cards but you can like Tune it to something.
Yeah, I mean yeah, you do soon it like you.
Yeah, yeah, that's that's what it was.
It's like you kind of like on the Fly, you're tuning it into something.
10:42
And and typically, I only had one archetype that are, you know, a kind of a hybrid archetype that I was after.
And I was able to get towards something towards that, and by the end of the game, it always resembled the same.
I think the best form of deck but that's one of his many flaws, but that's a whole other thing.
So, I think, I think the cards in this game are are interesting.
11:02
The first maybe I don't know 30 minutes or so it like I would I'll have to shout out.
This game has a tutorial mode and I was very appreciative of that because the symbology involved I thought was at first, maybe a little bamboozling to me.
11:18
Yeah.
It wasn't my favorite.
I forgot what this stuff was all the time and had to go like try and figure it out.
I will give it credit though because I think, like, once I got it, it's, it seemed to make intuitive sense.
And I was like, okay, like I get, I get why they picked the iconography for the stuff that they did their worst old.
11:37
Like, a lot of times, I had to rotate the camera around to make sure like, what the hell am I looking at?
And yeah, call him like like you're saying, I had to like, scroll over some of the enemies and like read the font to be like, okay, what exactly is this guy going to do On this turn.
There's a lot of stuff happening.
Yeah, line.
11:54
Just you like forget which enemy does what.
And it's not like you, I mean, I guess maybe if I played it for 30 hours, I would have eventually gotten to the point where I could glance at it and know exactly what it means.
But like, I played it for 10 and I Could remember quickly but it wasn't fast enough that I didn't have to scroll over them and kind of like okay this ad is this this guy says this because this and it matters a lot because like if you if you get it wrong it could absolutely destroy.
12:31
You like one single thing wrong can you could lose a run.
So I feel like we didn't finish fully explaining what the game actually is.
So you got the the deck building you playing playing cards, you have One or two sources of like resources to help me play these cards and then you beat up these dudes on a grid.
12:56
Like a little tactics Game Gear, Grand you fighting between three and five guys and a lot of it involves you manipulating where you are relative to them either by slipping around them or by moving them.
13:12
And there are some people who you can't move and if Forget that.
It's very bad because then you get killed.
Oh yeah, I think it's important to note that there's it has an element like into the breach for anyone who's may be more familiar with that game where it's if you push, dudes, no matter what their health is, if they get pushed into lava into the breach, they die in this game.
13:35
If you push them into the void which is anywhere.
I like like there's kind of a red marker which as if you push it do that they're they just die.
Which is super useful, that's one big thing.
And that thing like into the breach is that if you line up an enemy such that they're targeting another enemy, they will still attack the enemy which was one to me, it was like, really Rising getting into this case because I'm like why would this guy punches friend at full strength and like I mean it didn't he just see me push him over here or should he just not sweat?
14:01
But he they just swing.
They just are they've locked in what they're going to do a general.
Actually, that's not 100% true.
There's kind of a learning curve around what activates when they're going to actually shoot or not and figuring that out was kind of annoying but like then it all kind of.
Yeah it does click and I guess they didn't really cover that in kind of the advanced outside of that in more detail they didn't really give you the small subscript.
14:22
When someone's actually going to count or you, and like, there's a bunch of small things like the little rules.
You have to learn just through trial and error, I think.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think if you're, if you're coming to this game directly from into the breach, I think you'll notice a lot of similarities but a lot of key differences that will throw you for a loop and that that one definitely threw me for a loop for like, okay, I'm going to push this guy over here, and he will definitely shoot that other guy, or he will definitely punch that other dude, in the back of the head.
14:49
But no, that's not always the case because there's a thing about About I think you have to like walk through their line of sight if you have to have been in a position where they could have hit you.
Yeah like if they were going to hit you on their turn and then they move they would finish their shot or whatever.
15:09
But yeah, it took me they didn't explain that and it's toriel and it took me a while to I just was like, I guess it's just random.
It took me a basically half of my first playthrough before.
Understood.
You just hover over them and it would show you if they would do has it has attacked heard it was the thing right?
15:30
Is that an attack Target is not a specific enough.
Yeah, give me a pop up to the mouse over.
That tells me all the details about that.
Give me a two paragraphs if I need it but just like explain it in game Wiki.
Yeah.
15:47
How, how tight would you describe the spaces in this game?
Are they always tight?
Hmm, I mean Fair let me like I think there's a lot of the largest they got was something like eight by eight and they always have will obstacles or little things you can Vault over and they almost all of them.
16:05
In fact, I think all of them Except maybe like one have like all these different there like a place.
You can fight have at least one void Square, some of them have almost all avoid squares on the outside where you're pushing guys into the out and also some of them have just like one and I'm trying to obviously mitigate it such that if you're fighting a boss, it's really hard to like stuff the boss through a you know, push him over the edge and so I think they do a good job with that but yeah.
16:31
Just to generally speaking they're they're pretty tight.
And some of them like I know the there it's always the case that on the last Campaign before the final campaign on the level set or whatever.
Like you start in a three by three Square in an elevator with two dudes and so that always, it starts out pretty intense, you know, I was just gonna ask if there was an elevator stage.
16:50
I feel like I have, I have not done as much due diligence here as I, maybe should have by getting this far as will has, because like I had written down in my notes.
Like is there an elevator stage in this game?
Because that's kind of like, your prototypical stereotypical Trope of Fighting games is your, is your up and down elevator stage, but can yeah.
17:12
So elevator stage, can you at least like it kick people out of a window in it?
There is a one tile in the, in the 3X3 that you can kick people out of, okay.
I can you start in the middle and they start on either side of you and so you have to like navigate that and then I think one spawns in so it's usually three guys.
17:29
That's the other thing too.
That's like into the breach to like dudes will spawn in but they just kind of spawn in from above and they drop down and if you unlike into the breach where they're coming from underneath and if you stand on top of that, they actually take damage as they burst their head into you.
This is where they drop down.
And if you're in the way they just do nothing and then they try and spawn next time and different locations.
17:48
So just delays them coming in which from my point of view, mostly was worse because you want to kill them off quickly and the more dudes there were generally didn't complicate things.
In fact that oftentimes helped you because you could have them hurting each other with even more damage.
You had the right play.
And so yeah.
That was one of those things that yeah it didn't seem like it was to advantageous.
18:06
Yeah.
This is somewhat related to fighting in tight spaces, how tight it felt and how and back to the like shooting people and all that stuff.
18:23
They have a They have a replay mode after you beat the stage and it's a really cool idea.
And I'm sad that it was not executed differently because it just literally replays it and does the exact same moves, and I would have loved it if because, like, so the headcanon for me as like, oh, you're moving.
18:50
So sneakily through that, they're punching a guy.
Why they're missing you with their punch and they're hitting their friends.
Like that is a classic like Jackie Chan, Kung Fu stuff if they could have made it.
So that it were different animations during that fight and it was like made it look really fluid and finished the fight in like seven seconds.
19:16
I think that would have been A really cool thing that I understand why they didn't do it.
It's like oh just so easy.
Just make a whole second set of animations or maybe the third set and just do it for no for no gameplay reason.
But like I think so you you're right in that way.
19:37
I really like the the replay mode on here for when things go.
Well if I have like a really messy or crappy run on a level on a stage of just be like no I'm not going to watch that one but I did fumble around with some of the Options.
We're so in your standard kind of, you know, combat encounter that you're in in this game I think, is it like after every card that you play it?
19:59
The camera will change from like the three-quarter view to, you know, the Cinematic one and then your agent will go and like throw a punch and then it'll come back to the three the three quarter View.
Does that happen for every card.
It's just like on what it considers Critical Hits and like you can turn that on and off but like it's a it's not quite random but it's usually on what it can There is more epic, if I recall correctly because, yeah, I wound up changing the video or like those replay settings to be like, okay, in normal combat just stick in three-quarter, View mode and will save the Cinematic stuff for later.
20:31
And then when we're at replay time, there's you know, instead of having it replay all of the awkward jarring movement from that, three quarter View, just only play The Cinematic like up close and personal shot and that I think looks a lot.
20:48
Cooler there.
Still, it was like the jarring like Step stop.
Then kick.
It's like it didn't flow perfectly smoothly through it and it's like well they you know that doesn't matter at all while you're playing the like I'm going to sit here and stare at it for 30 seconds, trying to figure out the best move but like I'm supposed to be a super agent that's not needing to spend 30 seconds to figure out how to do it.
21:15
I'm supposed to be instantaneously doing it so and there's like a funny overlap between.
So one of those cinematic replay option modes has Like just show me like the critical hit stuff and it'll skip over all of the movement so like, yeah, you know, you'll go up, you'll throw a punch an enemy and then, you know, the, the enemy will like, try to punch.
21:35
But like you've moved away and it's like it's in kind of like those classic like video editing asynchrony.
Idiosyncrasies were like you know all of a sudden like the person's like the on the other end of the room.
They didn't like catch that my editing process.
Yeah which is starting to get more like the Jason Bourne.
21:53
Yeah.
I kind of appreciated that especially after I've been watching.
Maybe all the born fight scenes and with like quick quick quick cut and then all of a sudden he's on the other side of the room like okay this tracks.
But yeah I think like the the replay mode once I had those like settings dialed in I think I enjoyed it a lot more.
22:16
I don't know how often did you watch it?
I think I watched it whenever whenever I had like a pretty good.
It or like if I had like a no hit run or just like had something that felt like it flowed really nicely.
22:32
I wanted to watch the replay to be like okay came in here and then punch that guy.
And then I rolled over this thing.
And then I jumped over that.
I punch this guy and then I like Dodge behind this guy that guy shot him and then like just it looks really cool from that from that aspect of like, oh here's the replay with all of the Cinematic.
22:53
Like crits versus like me playing the the Tactical mode without seeing any of that stuff and it's just like a very nice different way to experience it if you if you hit all the right buttons but if there's you know times or you're just getting like clobbered and the Hand draw does not go your way and then you know I'm gonna just skip past the replay on that one but anytime anytime that I wind up winning by like jumping back.
23:19
Kicking a dude out a door.
Yeah, I say Stand by for the replay ones.
I didn't watch that many of them, but it was almost entirely a function of how many people that I kick off balconies.
Like, if it was a lot of like, shoving out of doors and off, balconies and downstairs and whatnot, that that was always a more enjoyable replay, watch.
23:43
This is all amazing to me.
I hit that button replay, all of us single time and I'm really okay.
I get it, probably three or four times, okay?
Jesse's like Matthew Under a like every time I'd be like because I mean I really wanted to like it I thought it was a really cool idea.
24:00
Normally I'm not that into replays of stuff like that but I think if it had been faster and that was my biggest, like, if it was really fast you could just watch the whole Replay in three or five seconds.
I think that would have been a really cool thing to have in there.
24:17
And I understand again, why they didn't create multiple.
Alternative sets of motion for their small indie game just for a replay that people aren't necessarily going to watch.
But Everyone's wrong.
24:33
Like I want to see if it looks cooler and and it was always like it looks fine.
There was a one time where I spawned into the the boss room for.
I think it was the end of the First Act where you're fighting the boss of the biker gang and I wound up I think in one or two turns just like running right up to him and just like like punch and he was like pinned up against the table like and much like into the breach.
25:02
Each you.
Anytime that you move an enemy into a space that's occupied.
They'll take damage and actually won't move, but I wound up just going up and just like Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, comboing, this guy and like, pushing them back on the table and then like one of the fight without taking any damage and like, okay, hit the replay button and then drop in roll around.
25:23
Who's and then like it felt like I was watching watching that kind of Matrix style, born action sequence Was really fun.
Wait.
Okay, hold on.
Will you've unlocked all the cards?
I'm assuming do are their movement cards where you roll?
25:42
No huge Miss well, maybe not a movement card but there is an attack card.
Yeah, there's the one where you flip over.
I've looked like the sweet Army roll.
There's like Dodge something.
I was just using one just before we were recording where it's an attack car, Where'd you attack the enemy?
26:03
And then you do like, like a like you like like grapple them and you, like roll past them and then they are like thrown to the floor as a right, you swap.
It's the one where you swap places and they end up down on behind where you were, right.
26:20
CT or card right there.
Absolutely, really Downing guys.
In general, is not good in this game.
That's fair.
You should have been able to like punch them while they're down.
Yeah, I have a big bold and underlined gripe note in my, in my Google doc of why can't I kick people in the Nerds?
26:41
Well, they're down.
Yeah, if you should have done like you couldn't do damage to them, it should have been the opposite.
You should have done more damage to them.
Yeah, again maybe comes out advantage on your attack roll.
Well like British agents are just too polite, you know, they're not going to kick a guy while he's now and you got to be up on your feet for that.
27:02
They try to build an archetype around hurting down to guys and hurting stun, guys, and like that kind of stuff.
But the problem is that the frequency of those cards, come up is so it's so rare and this energy is so weak that it's just like oh I can apply bleach more bleed to a down guy.
27:17
Cool.
So that means I have to not only have like a deck focused on getting people down the but also focused on bleed and like it's just not a very synergistic like build overall and so it's just like it's it almost feels like they want.
They put this out that like some specific cards that I kind of Bridge to archetypes, just for the purpose of being a bridge and being like, hey, this is something you should strive for trying to get dudes down so you can afflict this bleed to on them or and it's just like, no that's that's a that's like yours.
27:47
You're trying to fool the player into building these really shitty deck so they learned never to ever choose that card again.
So if that's how it felt to me, did it feel to you like you could Get the same deck every time.
28:03
Yes, nearly, yeah.
I think that's probably the biggest problem with this game that I think of, in terms of, It's you can just play the same.
You can build the same deck every time you don't have to like, you know, comparing it to something like slide.
28:22
This fire which is the like AAS to tear deck building game.
Like it's like the Spire, you can't play the same deck every time.
Like you just won't get the carbs and You're at Fourth and some weird archetype and then you have a great time playing like oh I wasn't planning on playing weird poison pill but now I am I didn't feel.
28:44
I mean I've only I only play through it twice, Fitz twice and that I mean the runs are long and so they take a long time to get through.
And also I was told I was playing on the mode where they let you do like take-backsies and also restart a level and I I think that was good because you could make like a small mistake and have it just end your run and that's really frustrating.
29:12
But it also meant that I like I ended my first run before I technically lost because I was like well I could probably grind my way through this eventually, but like I'm just going to lose like I know that I'm on a losing run and it's going to take me an hour to get to something, where I can't continue.
29:30
Restarting, the level and finish it somehow, Now it's kind of here.
We have it, the biggest and largest flaw in the game, calling just laid it down.
It is way too long for run and this, this is like the heart of so many related problems, but I think on average it was about 3.5 hours.
29:52
I think with the last one I did were actually beat.
It was like three hours again.
I had memorized.
What all of you.
I don't have to mouse-over dudes anymore by that point to understand what they do and like, so three hours to go through a game.
Whereas As slaves, fire, you're in and out quick.
Yeah.
It's like it's an hour at the very most and that's if you win, which is like you're if you're behind the power curve, you're out the game kicks you out right away.
30:13
If you don't have a good enough, pretty, pretty fast, whereas like if you're doing like, what Collins difficulty.
Yeah.
Then you just, yeah, you can stick in it.
And you just have this really annoying grind, we're just behind and you have to keep doing these resets and like oh you just slowly bleed out essentially because you can't ever crawl your way back above the power curve, is it fair?
30:32
So in Slay, the Spire there are, I guess we'll say they're three acts, right?
3mn and the boss.
And yeah, well, I mean like I'm not I'm not good enough to actually get to the hard, so I don't know.
I'm sure if I actually count that one, you haven't beat the heart on, you know, I don't think I've ever done any Ascension levels and only shit and you're you're not even qualified to be hosting this podcast.
30:58
I'm pretty sure that's what time we're getting.
There were getting there.
I mean, we're going to split off.
After this latest fire podcast where it's just, we'll talking about slay, the Spire for an hour every week.
Oh my God, that sounds fantastic.
So fights and tight spaces, we have.
31:15
Death's-head biker gang Act One, fighting bikers the Insiders act, two more prison, prison yard things and and the I do appreciate that.
The that the level designs are obviously geared to be thematic with these also.
31:34
So biker gangs you have like tattoo parlors.
You have like motorcycle repair shops, the prison, the prison act, you know, you're in like jail houses and And stuff like this in Van.
Yeah.
Like I said the prison van was like, an annoying level, but also like a very good level.
31:54
It's like that one was like eight spaces.
Mmm.
And boy, you could get stuck in it.
Usually like, oh no, I'm in a corner.
I can't get out.
I got after restart this level because I guess, yeah.
Like I could see.
32:10
So the first one that I did, I Yeah, I just I restarted too many levels and eventually I was like, this is bad.
I should just restart the game, but yeah, one of the van ones was one of those where I like had to try three or four times in like okay if I have this exact sequence then I can finally get around to this thing and then and then win.
32:34
Yeah.
And like and each of these levels has very different amounts of of walls and obstacles that are that Can be critical like to your well, I don't know.
Like it feels like to me for the Decks that I was using that.
32:52
Oh I should pick this one because it's much smaller.
My deck has like two or three extra cards that involves things that it like you need a wall to press off of or like, if I could do it, he's going to move and if he moves into the walls going to take more damage.
So I should pick the smaller level.
33:10
I felt like there were there was like a halfway decent amount of choice.
That I had to do for that.
But the act after the prison one I have only just gotten to, which is the, the Ninja, the Ninja act, you're fighting the Jade staff, the act after that you're fighting the mafia and then I'm guessing will the final mission is where you're just like, boss rushing, the end where you just like fighting all the enemies that you fought before.
33:41
No, no, actually, it's quite different.
Current do want to give, I mean this spoilers here, I mean, yeah, well I'll say real quick that like I've only gotten just to the ninja act right now because like I don't know if there's other than the, the takes, you takes you back scenes, which I do appreciate for the easier difficulty levels.
34:00
I kind of wish like the Spire had that, to be honest, because I'm really bad at like, I'm going to play this card, I'm a genius.
Oh, no.
If there was an option like that for, like, Noob mode in slay, the spire and greatly appreciate it, but Yeah, like I did a test where I played on the axle Maps, maximum Hardest Level difficulty and I got like, I got pretty far like, I almost beat the prison level.
34:24
There is just like one or two like, you know, casual mistakes that I made and like, oh wow, I actually didn't expect to get this far and then I have been playing on like the Newbie is easiest level difficulty mode that I can and like healing at all possible turns.
And like I was like, I had to restart a stage once because like I got I got killed somehow but there.
34:44
There's a huge difference between the hardest mode in the easiest mode.
It's really all in terms of how much they let you reset stuff which can be big.
Yeah, I mean it's big.
It means you can eventually just work your way through it like a chess puzzle or something but like Playing through the easy mode isn't necessarily that much easier than the hard mode.
35:09
I mean if you're very good you don't need to restart so, you know, the playthrough would be similar.
Yeah, I guess we do have to make an on-air shout out for the the ninja act having Steven Seagal look-alikes, whoo-hoo, I guess belly slam you We don't actually have a push, but he is, he does have the girth of the real-life Steven Seagal, and the same facial hair and general possessed ants.
35:41
The same actually call him Steven Seagal, but it's very clear, it's modeled after him.
Yeah, the same Heroes and torso.
There are just a bunch of like true ninjas.
And then this guy and you're like, this doesn't belong.
I'm just a cook.
I don't know anything about the mafia act, but I'm guessing lots of guns.
36:02
Yeah, yeah.
Generally that's the case a lot of dudes with counter and a lot and like the one of the Lieutenant's has a little he just shakes his little drink thing and it's a cast spells on you essentially and so.
All right.
Yeah, the bartender guy.
Yeah, and so but I think overall just through that progression before the the Final Act, they do a very good job of introducing new mechanics as they go along.
36:26
And so I just starting off with.
Yep, here's a dude.
And his special characteristic is that He has push like very simple stuff and then getting into oh well this one like shoots out and I like you know in a all directions and this one like you know swings his arm and all directions.
36:44
And so I was like okay yeah get it.
And then by the time you get to the ninjas do they can move really far and one can teleport.
Yeah.
You have to attack some some of them from behind because they have like weapons.
And then finally got these guys that have like they attack every single time you move within like they have all three Auto Attacks with their weapon.
37:03
This would moves when you move every single time, this one Dodges your first attack every time they introduce all these mechanics in a very gradual way.
And a way that does take time to learn but like it's a it feels like a pretty natural sort of learning curve.
And I think usually by the second or third time, you kind of you start to get it.
37:22
I think calling you said.
Yeah, second or third time.
Third time is about.
Yeah. 11 hours or however long you're into it.
So yeah.
I feel like so I lost my second.
Run on the final stage of fighting the boss.
So the final stage the boss stage is 44, I think it's four levels are for yes.
37:44
Said the variables that you go in a row and there's no choice.
It's just one after the other.
And each time you're fighting the boss and some of the minions and you're like Shipping down his health kind of but not actually if they're like each stage, you have to get his health down further but then you have full him the next stage which is it's always 45.
38:06
You just do it.
If you do 45 to it ends the and he's like 280 health or something but and then it just he respawns with all his minions intact and then you do it again three times.
And then finally there he is with that 280.
We're so Health with Five Guys.
This t-shirt this is started with 500 or whatever and so we don't have been more satisfying.
38:24
Why is that?
It should be and it should be Like you starts the next round with the exact amount so you try and get as much as you can, that would be fun.
But like all of those things come together then and the last level, the Lost Levels and then it gets really hard.
38:45
Like the boss is so hard because he's got like counter and he can move and you do all this stuff.
I don't like I just couldn't I just couldn't hit him like I drew trying to run around and be like I'm gonna if I hit this guy he's gonna punch me back for 25 damage that's like half my health.
39:04
So you like oh yeah.
Like, do some weird stuff have to get the minions to shoot at him, something like that, but it's very difficult and the fact that you rotates through his abilities, like he is like over four turns, he has four different like sets of things, you'll do one where he has like counter plus, like he always cannot be pushed.
39:24
And as the thing about, like some of these, the last two bosses, like you can't push them over light.
Just like there's a ledge you're on it.
You're on the edge of a plane.
Oh yeah, just kick him off right.
Easy.
Nope, he just can't be pushed and Thankfully like he can be stunned but he cannot be downed, isn't there?
Like, well, I guess he could be down under certain circumstances says like a.
39:42
That's why being down some of the turns he can be in on some of the terms, he can't?
Right?
Exactly.
So that's why it was a kind of a crapshoot to get to build the decks.
That's where especially good at pushing the first deck when I got to them, like, didn't get touched at all.
Like there's like, no one ever hit me.
39:58
I just would grab them, push them off the edge.
Grab this guy.
Spin them around.
It was all just like me doing Jiu-Jitsu without actually Contact gives you this boss, couldn't do it.
God damn thing and just it was so frustrating.
And so that's why the giant spoiler.
40:14
The bleed Dodge archetype bleed sucks all the way through the game, pretty much until you get to the boss.
And then the soon as you have bleed at the boss, that's how you beat him and it's a works pretty well.
And then Dodge Dodge is the most overpowered, mechanic in the game.
40:31
Like, what block is like, another alternative and block is ago, you have blocked some amount of Of damage.
And it's just like why would you ever want to block when you could Dodge by Dodge is better and every single way and especially the moves that are like gain to dodge, it's just like so the next two things coming at you, you just take zero damage and it's just like, yeah, that is the Str card and like there's like a few because like five cards that have dodged just like always get grabbed Dodge.
40:56
Whenever you can is essentially the goal, especially since a lot of times by the end of the game, you need to play more than one card in it to in order to have enough block.
To block even one attack, right?
And that was I so clutched.
It was like you would hit that you apply the Dodge do the attack.
41:11
He's gonna counter you but you just gonna Dodge it and that's the only way you can really get a tax in.
Yeah, I so my first met my good playthrough was a push and combo.
So combo is the second kind of resource where it's you.
41:27
Build up the every time you do an attack you build up combo and then you lose that combo by either doing some sort of finishing move.
Or every time you move every space you move, you lose the combo unless you have like some special cards.
And so I ended up with stuff where I'm doing a lot of pushing item, a bunch of like zero cost cards that I could just push people around and then and you could use those to like, build up your combo stuff.
41:53
But you can't use them on the people, you can't push.
And so there be times where I'd be like, I have this Suite card that I could play, if I could use this attack push card.
I don't even care if it moves him.
I just want to use the car to like, try to push him and just be like, oh no, it didn't work.
42:12
But I like it's another combo.
And now I can use my like, I don't know fly across the room knee kick to the face.
That does stun like 5 combo Ultra card that.
Well no I only have four.
So someone had a really good idea.
42:28
Been spying on the the fights in tight spaces.
Discord over the past couple weeks, someone had a really good idea of like, for those enemies that like can't be pushed or downed counting them as walls.
So like if you wanted to do like a jump kick or something, but you need to walk.
42:46
But there's like this in moot like basically, like the enemy himself as a brick wall, well, I'm just going to like jump off that guy and punch.
I see no downside to that.
That's just an objective better.
That's just an objective win.
That, it's just fun head smashed.
Just grabbing the enemy's head.
Smashing him into the belly of this guy.
43:03
I love it.
I feel like that's just extremely fun.
Yeah, like the idea of you smashing engine, some No one else and be like, well he didn't move so it hurt.
I want to make a quick shout out to the soundtrack to this game being very appropriately.
43:24
Discotheque in the sense of like, the the intro to the blade movie, where it's very, very techno.
You're going around, just like, punching the crap out of dudes.
I really like the soundtrack to this game, because it felt like it made helped me, focus, and be in the zone a lot, but I don't know if if I literally start forever, no memory of this soundtrack.
43:47
I could not even tell you if it had music.
I'm sure it did.
But like, I'm like, trying to think.
Like, did I a song stuck in my head?
It's like, I don't even remember hearing music.
I probably didn't turn it off.
I wouldn't say all of the, all the music, sounds the same, because there's definitely like ones that sound different.
44:07
But it's, it's that kind of like house dance music.
That's like, like, really hard to hum through a kazoo like, like I hear it in my head and I was listening to it all day while working today and like typing code and stuff but like working.
44:23
Yeah, but like, yeah, I felt like Most of the times I was just playing this on the couch while watching TV and the thing was muted on my steamed egg, but the times that I was playing it and actually had like the music you knowing, it felt like a help to to elevate the material in a very like action e way, that felt very appropriate.
44:50
So I just wanted to shout out the the soundtrack to this but I know that house jams aren't for everybody.
Yeah, no, I like with the Cinematic.
I turn that off pretty much right away.
I just, I just I mean I I kind of got the game after the first playthrough in terms of like what to expect and so I that's what I muted it and essentially put my Seinfeld up on the side and scratch my beard, as I made these decisions, and listen to Kramer, talk about the new Mania, man, that kind of thing.
45:21
And so we really I think that this kind of game goes well with the show that like, you've seen a thousand times and just like, you know, want to listen to something in the background or like an audiobook, or that kind of thing to be good podcast game, listening to an audiobook, while you're doing a game blasphemy.
45:41
I wanted to ask, I wanted to ask this, the the Spire experts about how this games like shop.
And rest two locations were different than slay the Spire.
Because slay, this fire being like, kind of, my only other data point for like card-based roguelikes or deck, builder, roguelikes insulate aspired.
46:04
Like when you go to a shop, you know, you can purchase potions, you can get different feel, It felt like and slay, the Spire, you had more.
A diverse selection of options that even like weren't just the cards per se.
46:22
Yeah, like like three, you could buy potions.
You can buy artifacts and you could buy.
Well, you could remove a card to remove cards and you could upgrade, or could you upgrade cards?
Can you upgrade cards at store and the way they have this structure it is they have five cards across the top one of which was randomly selected to be on sale.
46:40
So there's like automatically an element of like oh this is your deal and then they also have a colorless card which is a Rarity, which is sometimes very good for your bill and then there's also like the selection of three different artifacts selection of three different potions and then a card removal service.
46:55
So in terms of like the robustness of the, the merchant, it's pretty pretty high.
I'd say, overall because there's no potion equivalent here, really or article, I mean, I'll argue that the artifact equivalent is not equivalent in the artifacts.
They have, I don't know, I don't know, with are called in this game, but that's all limitations or something.
47:14
That is one of the critical lacking.
Features of this, which is loud.
That's, that's one of the reasons why synergies are so hard to form outside of just.
Oh, yeah, actually, okay, that makes a lot of because I was thinking about it was like why why enslave us fire?
47:29
Don't you just play the same thing every time it's because you get wildly different artifacts that completely change.
What you should be going for what your build should be.
Yeah.
Now I'm sorry, I didn't mean to detract from what you're saying is there are still very strong differences in shops, the campfire.
47:46
Anak is very different as well.
But like this, this, this one I think it's worth just pointing out like they get the length of the game wrong, they don't have artifacts, which is another big mistake.
I mean, they do, they're just not right.
They have the I would call them boss level artifacts.
Like if they're only artifacts that you get, once you defeat a boss, is a No-No, Elite level artifacts?
48:05
Yeah, yeah right.
There were there were there, only the kind of a, I guess.
Yeah.
There was it was a basically.
There's the I do you get up to like four or five.
You have to like get one argument which is like letting you Get the other ones which are no.
And then displays fire run.
You have like 20 augments?
48:22
Yeah.
And some of them were just wildly about like the the and I know that there's, it's fun to have some like that are more powerful than others, but one of them was just like, plus two momentum versus like another one, which is like +1 momentum and it's just like, oh if you just randomly get this one and they do have that mechanic inflatable fireworks.
48:38
Like here's a, here's one that's plus 16.
Max HP and this one is plus ten.
And so it's like, oh yeah, that one's clearly betel.
But like to just double and specially Some momentum is like, that's your that's your energy that's allows you.
If you have draw five cards and they're all one momentum each, you can play all your cards, which is such a huge difference.
48:54
And so whatever you got certain enhancements, like that one right there, you were just set your just like, oh now I'm just going to take all the most expensive momentum cards and be able to play the best cards without having to worry about running out of energy.
So yeah, man, that's really just it's a stupid.
49:10
They they did that one wrong.
They fucked up right there.
So the first so Of my two runs.
The first one, I took a weird augment its the every turn at the start of your turn you take 3 damage but at the end of the round you heal back to full health hmm and it is a wildly different game and because you just have a hard set limit on your number of terms, right?
49:40
And then also health is not our health is a resource that you manage within each.
Battle, but not across the whole stage, which is could just a completely different type of big and, like, heinola, and the other one I did.
49:58
Like, there's there's some ground that I did that are Level.
I did that took 19 turns because I just, there's one big fat guy who had such big counter and I could not, I had to have like the exact right five cards in my hand, in order to do enough, damage to him without him.
50:16
Otto countering me to death and so I just ran away from him and waited to draw that good hand and just like throw a stun dart at him and punch him a couple times and run away.
But I feel like this, I do appreciate that.
50:33
This game is trying to not be a direct.
Slay, the Spire clone, but I feel like there is I'm starting to come around on reason like seeing why people think that it's like this fire.
Like, you know, and as super plus tier game where like people, you mean?
50:52
Well, I mean, just let you know, the general community at large because like, it's so it's so well home from every angle that, like, you inevitably just compared, literally, every like game that involves deck-building, it's like an excited.
51:07
It's the same with, like, when you're playing a game that's in any way close to factorio and you're like, God, I wish they would just take this control scheme, that factorio has like they've just optimized every quality of life and now I can't help but wish that they had just exactly stolen the way that factorio does.
51:27
Every way of placing buildings.
Yeah.
I feel like if I could make one one major change for me, which I was like a dog that this wasn't a thing in here because again, I don't know if this is just like slate Aspire has just set this as the de facto standard or like are you getting too close?
51:46
Suet by doing this full health at the start of Every Act.
Like it boggles my mind that that's not a thing in this game, like my crazy.
That's its +20 Health.
If you be the boss within a certain day, a lot of them returns.
If you must you really mess up, usually I ever, I never didn't get that.
52:05
And also, like the other thing is like, slaves, fire, once someday, when you graduate to the Ascension levels Sky, you'll realize you don't get full health every time and in fact, it only restores a certain portion of your health back when you finish these acts and that's you'll never get to that point.
So so is that?
52:22
Like I didn't, it's so much work.
I'm not willing to put in 1000.
Oh God.
It's just the best is the most fun work you'll ever do that.
But yes.
So hot.
Yeah, that I don't know.
It's tell you they're than like yeah.
It's unless you taking a long time to beat the bosses at is usually not too, not so bad, but I think in my runs, I only went to the medical thing because it's always in.
52:44
This is kind of another thing that just doesn't make sense.
It was, it's always a decision and you have to sometimes make it like big due to the nature of the mapping system.
You have Like to say, oh, am I gonna go to the gym or the medic thing?
But you make that two turns in advance because only one will go in that direction.
And then it's always either or, like, in other games, it's like, oh, you have an upgrade and maybe you can go down and there's of some benefit to taking the fight over doing the medical.
53:04
But here is just like and then the medical, if you go there, first of all, always cost like the campfire thing.
I like in other games, I was just like, you know, your games, huh?
Giggling like you can just choose life decision is you get life for free or you can upgrade or you get for Ascension stuff but like It's like a there's a clear cost-benefit thing.
53:24
Sometimes if you show up to the medical place you have no money in this.
Just for a reason you're just host, it's just like well I'm sorry you didn't, you couldn't afford it, this is just a preview of the privatisation of the NHS in the UK.
So they're just, I just like, yeah, yeah.
I had a string of things where I just I had no money.
53:40
I'd like a hospital and then in one of the like random events that also required money.
And then like something else and it's like, every time I was like, I can't get this money.
It was like Do this without taking damage and I just kept getting like one ship in somewhere.
53:57
Oh maybe like To build.
I want to build on.
Let's let you finish.
Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
Yeah.
I was pretty much the end of it.
I wanted to build a.
So we've talked about, I think a lot most of them game mechanics here.
The, the, the had a mapping system works a little bit was very, you know, the, you know, decisions between the fights and like, and all these other things.
54:18
But like the events.
Mmm, really bright like the events in this game are I mean, to be fair like most events and like in most of these things are like a simple like dialogue screen where you're making a decision.
And unlike thank God unlike FTL, which is just like you, who knows what percent chance, the outcome is going to be and it really pissed me off as a result as I said before, like, at least this one kind of, it says, oh yeah, 80% chance of an unfavorable outcome.
54:46
But like 20% chance of getting a new augmentation or something and like and it gives you like the specific chance but like I just found them to be very.
I mean, they're all fanatic with like they're like they're bonding Ons theme or they're kind of a special agent but I just felt they were kind of lame.
And I will say, I like slay, the Spire is like these mini games.
55:04
There's like a hey match cards together and like, you know, hey there's something to do with like even if it's just click a thing and have it spin around and do something, it's like, it's something neat and there's another one, just like, you know, click this button to like try to get a relic or take damage and keep doing that if you wanted.
55:20
Like, there's so many more interesting Dynamics.
They built into this this was always just like choose one of the other.
Here's your present.
And it's event over and it just like I always do, I always chose the events because I hated the combat so much.
I just want to get through it and it's better to long.
I didn't I mean like it was fine but it just like that was faster and I'd always choose the faster option.
55:38
There's an element of character that the slay, the Spire events have that does feel very much like you when you go to an event in slay the spider it's like okay you're in the world of it and it feels like okay I'm seeing like what this bizarre, you know.
55:55
Universe that I'm living in looks like from kind of the ground level outside of combat and in fights in tight spaces, I feel like there's a missed opportunity where the, the events don't tie into some broader narrative in that like, you know, I could imagine something in this game of like, you know, you are the agent sent on the mission to like infiltrate the biker gang, then you go into the prison, then you fight Ninjas for whatever reason.
56:23
And at the end it turns out o like Bad guy all along with Section 11 and that they've, they've sold you out and you basically have to fight like, you know, arrival agent from from your CIA and MI6 Collective or, you know, some kind of like operative twist like that and having like that kind of the know like Bond style was born.
56:48
It's almost like you haven't finished the game Scott.
That's exactly what the game finishes, which is it.
Well, now that I have now that I've precog did the whole ending of the game, I feel like yeah.
So anyway the events I feel like didn't really give me that kind of a hint at all or like, didn't it didn't like sell me on like, oh, I am in a mission impossible.
57:14
I am in a.
Where's the 11th?
Like save the babe.
Well, they're like there's that but like I mean, you feel like you're missing out on half of the James Bond stuff.
Yeah.
Like there's a lot of like just go to like the TV Tropes.com and just scroll through all of their bond stuff and be like okay let's put it in here but like there's it was too serious.
57:39
I wanted a little bit it to have a little more fun with itself with like the laser Thea them to, you know, with the events.
Yeah.
Yeah.
With the events but that yeah there's stuff.
It was the seriousness fell appropriate.
But yeah.
But like just here, draw your boys like that, that the end, the end that you just just so, you know, it's your agent 11, 11, and the other guy is Agent 11 XIII.
57:59
That's like, in the Roman numerals and so, oh, he's like your oo6.
I mean, that's why I joked in our chat that I was agent 11 with the 11th.
Right?
Right.
Yeah, exactly.
I didn't realize that you didn't understand that.
That was a joke but I was going to say here, they don't.
58:17
Introduce the villain until the Final Act and like if this is the Big Boss.
Dude.
Like any other ones you like?
So what is the heart to you?
It's just like You are in the spire and you could hear this heartbeat.
58:32
I used to hear the heartbeat.
Maybe.
I'm maybe I'm you know I don't actually know what even knows I exist the first time you run through the tower.
Yeah you just die at the end.
It's very weird but it doesn't exactly.
But So that's its introduction to like there being something larger like a grand grander purpose is that you just died and you're like, what's going on here, there's a greater story and so the story so that's kind of its introduction of like there is some greater nefarious thing out there whereas you don't even get the sense of that in this game.
58:58
You're just like, okay, Going in boss at the end.
Great going in boss at the end.
Don't know who this boss is.
Don't care.
I'm gonna throw him off the edge anyways and so can the until the end at the very end but yeah that's it.
Come on character development, guys.
59:13
We're going to have a narrative.
Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's a, we pretty much talked about it all.
I think it's time to have rate, whether we like this game, better or worse, than slay, the Spire.
Well we haven't gotten there yet.
Oh yeah.
59:28
What do we got?
I can listen or grievances.
I'm happy to just I have a list of repairing them.
I can hear them.
Yeah.
I guess I'll go first.
I think I like this game.
I don't know.
I feel like I'm in.
Desperate need to go back to invisible ink and just play invisible ink with only one character.
59:45
Ha and then just like, see see how that like overpowered progression goes?
You could definitely would just lose.
Yeah, I think I like I think fights in tight spaces.
I like I'm gonna put in my number four, so I think I liked it a little bit more than stack lands.
1:00:04
I was pretty hot on stack lines.
When we did that episode, I haven't touched it since but I could see myself going back to fights in tight spaces and like maybe getting to the end but like I don't know like Way that you're describing the boss fight and like yeah maybe I'll try it once but I don't feel super motivated to finish it.
1:00:20
So just above stack lands behind Binding of Isaac rebirth.
Which I think at the moment is kind of like, my, my great line like games above Binding of Isaac have to be capital G grade.
And I feel like fights and tight spaces is is a capital G good game there's nothing like it's not particularly buggy I really like the art style.
1:00:39
I think the music is really fun.
There's some good ideas here.
It doesn't need to be a slave a spy or clone, but There's aspects from Salinas fire.
That would maybe help to elevate this game a little bit.
I want to see a fights in tight spaces to that's a Batman game and I think that would be amazing.
1:00:55
Oh shit, that sounds amazing.
Or I honestly I like the format of it.
I feel like you could do a lot of stuff with it.
It could be a Batman game at cochlea Spider-Man game.
I think that you could be like the reason why it absolutely is not a slave Aspire clone is because the way that you fight with the Attic stuff.
1:01:15
I think is significantly different, so, and and major departure area, and I think that it is an untapped like there have been true slaves, fire clones, they were like, move around.
All the like, it's something like monster.
Trained is pretty much a, it's a lot more similar to slay, this fire, this.
1:01:32
I feel like is I haven't seen any other game that's like this and I feel like you could explore this card.
Combination of cards and movement a lot more in any other genre like a like a genre.
1:01:50
But you know, skin of theme over the top of it.
I would love I would love it if it's two or in a comprehension Moon, expansion would be nice.
You know, I'm going to make a claim here and I'd love to hear like a reputation but like in building a game like this, you have, if you're going to shoot you, Cannot add these two mechanics together, which is to say like you have to choose behind between having multiple characters and having a deck and they and where you're playing cards.
1:02:19
And the reason is they work the same in terms of your mental computation in terms of what you're doing because when you have like an invisible ink I think it's the perfect comparison.
You have like you know up to like four Dudes or whatever.
And so your decision-making just like just like holding a hand like which car do you play first?
1:02:34
You're thinking, which character do I move first to where you're starting to build a map of like, what's going to happen during over the The turn and so like this is just one of those things where like it's an interesting thing to have a deck of cards and some be able to like figure it out but it's you can't have both of these things together.
1:02:56
Yeah, no I think you're absolutely correct.
I think that you could only have a single controllable character and a deck of cards like you could not if there were two people moving around you but two hands it would be Badness chaos.
And so and so I'll add though like what happens though?
1:03:13
When you only have the deck of cards though, and one character is that you minimize your reducing surprise.
And surprise is one of those things in games which is like an inherent source of fun.
So, when you're drawing five cards, that is your source of surprise during the day or during the turn, like, in general with this game, you are not drawing more cards, like you typically draw it and then it's a puzzle.
1:03:34
How do I use these five cards?
And then it's just basically grinding out like, you know, mentally like planning out your moves, how things are going?
As to give the example, which are, you know, I'm about to give its latest fire is much more card draw Focus.
Everyone has cards, like almost like, it's every fifth card is a card draw card.
1:03:51
And so as you play those cards, your get, the surprise of like, is this going to be the thing I needed?
Or is it going to be the thing that screws or was it going to be more card dry?
Like it's this is just it layers in and elements of more surprised over the course of one turn.
And so that to me, makes it a just inherently more fun system than to have something where you have Have essentially five cards where you just, here's your puzzle.
1:04:13
No surprise.
But like right there, right?
And draw cards.
And yes.
Yeah.
And I again, but like I that is true but they're like, they're few and far between and they're definitely not like the one in five that you see in I feel like that's a that's a pretty kind of the cards themselves I which is valid, I really liked the card Plus board area movement combination.
1:04:41
Actually kind of a weird comparison also would be like Gloom Haven.
Hmm.
I mean, it's a board game, but it is a, you know, a movement based card system.
I think it's one of the only other things that I've seen where it's both carbs and square movement, I guess, but just board games have that more in general, but Gloom human does have an app on Steam.
1:05:08
It does?
I played it?
Yeah, any good.
Wait, no, no.
I've played the official tabletop Simulator for 50k, which is technically on Steam, but not the same way, right?
Which is very good.
1:05:24
Hmm, jaws of the Lions.
Very, very good super well optimized.
But anyway, I have it ranked as my number 44.
No number in R4 and R3, right?
It it number three of my 14 games, I liked it.
1:05:41
I liked it a lot.
I think there's like some some rough edges.
I think it could be better.
I think there are other things that like, it's not the perfect game, but I really liked the card and area movement concept like that.
1:06:04
I think it's I think it's Superior to slay the Spire in that concept.
I think that it doesn't do the cards as well, but it does let you like I think the interaction of those two systems could lead to an extremely interesting decision space and it didn't quite get there.
1:06:27
But I thought like there are a lot of times that some of the times when you like got the couple moves and you got you like finished the puzzle, they'll really Satisfying.
You like I thought I was going to not be able to do this but I worked my way through and I did this and this and this and I got out of this situation and then I pushed the guy off and then I was home free.
1:06:49
And like I felt very good when you got it like out of the tight space.
Fair enough and actually it looks like we agree overall looking at your ranking I mean like generally speaking, I had this up there just under invisible ink as well.
1:07:07
I had a tattoo on my 1 to 10 scale at a 7.5 which in terms of the, how many 14 games we played.
It's a three-way tie for seconds because I think because of the scale here, but it's a fights in tight spaces tie with FTL and The Binding of Isaac rebirth and a That was a Binding of Isaac rebirth is slightly better than these ones, but as I was saying, like, before we jump on this podcast, like but I didn't, I think a 20 point scale is enough, it's just barely better, but it's not like it's I think it's worth calling out that it is a better game.
1:07:40
But fighting tight spaces, I didn't put 34 hours into it and I got to say the last 10 was an extreme grind because I'm playing on the normal difficulty and like I all I want to do is beat the game.
I'm one of those those what is it that II for you?
Always forget which is the one that enjoys the pain but like that's NASA Kawaii.
1:07:57
Yeah.
That that's how I got through all this engine runs, honestly, as well as like I have to beat it at the maximum level, and like this, the classic difficulty I think was, what felt like they had other levels, but I think they just that were augmentations of that level 2, but no replays, when you just get absolutely hos because you made, you forget one, small thing.
1:08:19
It just, it's one of the most frustrating things, and yet you really do want to have that.
Oh, oh no!
I just, I forgot that guy just gonna Dodge the first one is, Everything was planned around him.
Getting hit by that thing and it's just yeah, that's why I really liked having a little rewind button.
Yeah.
But of course, I had to beat it at the max difficulty so I did it.
1:08:37
I got through it.
Took me three tries to beat the the boss, finally, but it's funny because all the other ones, like, taking no damage.
Like the build was pretty much perfect all the way to the end and then just get hose.
And so, finally that like I said, I dodge and bleed, got did the job and no damage it even in the last last rounds.
1:08:56
And yeah, it was It was fun.
Game was fun game.
I should have played it less than I did, and I should've done it on the hardcore difficulty, but, you know, unlike you guys, I don't have.
What do I have to do with my time here?
I gotta play some video games.
Exactly right into the show.

1:09:32
All of our shows with links to stuff all that good stuff?
Our next episode.
I was excited that the, that the randomizer lever, that I pulled this time, got me, three games that I was like, you know what, I would be thrilled to play any three of these, but we're not doing monolith this time.
1:09:53
We're not doing Monster train.
This time, I am kind of stoked.
That we're going to be playing some War Sim the realm of escalona.
Next, I was actually pretty excited for it looks super weird, very different.
1:10:09
Yeah, I'm it could be terrible but it could be really interesting.
And I mean, it's just like a text simulator Kingdom game.
I do, I don't know what to expect, but, um, all it was described as like kenshi, which is Not very many games are described as like Kenji so that that piques my interest and I could see that it peaked Wills interest to oh, I didn't realize that.
1:10:35
Yeah, I know I saw the Dave's took themselves not very seriously and there's a lot of like, you know, it seemed like a light-hearted game but that describe is like kenshi and rimworld.
Like I do like those games a lot.
So I think you can you can throw basically everyone into a dungeon that if they displease you and you can you can lose a betting matches with Who soiled themselves constantly and there are goblin rap battles that happened in the game snail races to.
1:11:03
They advertise that a lot on the the steam page I saw.
So yeah, decided to bet on some snails.
All right, we're going to we're going to bet on some snails for next time with more Sim, the realm of escalona.
We'll see you there.
