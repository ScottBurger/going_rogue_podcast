Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Rogue Like podcast where each episode we focus on Rogue like game baby sized or fully armed and then we try to rank it as best we can against all the other games that we've played thus far.
0:35
I am your host of this podcast.
A plushy squishy cute pink amphibian stuffed animals got burger and with me in the pond cast here are my Co host animal friends.
The podcast.
That's great.
Yeah, I guess.
I guess that makes me a a stinky diaper for one of these goddamn axolotl babies.
0:55
Will.
That's me.
Damn it.
I was going to be a stinky baby diaper.
Well, while you think of 10 Go.
Ahead I'll be I'll be a spoon that a tiny baby Dumb axe.
A lot of leads.
Chomp.
And I, lastly am Andrew Harshman, also known as AK.
1:12
Andrew K Hey, K, Harshman, there we go.
Hey, K Hey K Harshman.
Is that the?
Yeah, there we go.
That'll work.
That'll work.
This week we're talking about exactly what George Orwell had in mind when writing the the book Animal Farm.
1:29
It's Axolotl released very freshly September 14th, 2023, a whopping 53 days ago from when we're recording.
I got to go check, go back and check the records to see if Darkest Dungeon Two was the other game that we viewed fresh out of the cannon.
1:47
Yeah.
I mean and I don't know if we reviewed any other ones but that one we reviewed like pretty much straight off that one was super fresh.
Axolotl, you can go out and find basically everywhere, PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch you name it you can you can find it there.
2:04
This was developed by two awesome studio who I think have developed.
They've developed a a whole swath of games I think in in varying degrees of depth I guess.
But this is this is a crew of Spanish game devs that I believe are used to work at the European Space Agency as engineers before they started to move into game dev.
2:28
So Colin, there is hope.
Don't don't worry about it.
They've developed other games, 2017 Dimension Drive, 2021, Aeon Drive, 2023 with Axolotl, and coming soon they have a Metroidvania game coming out.
2:44
This game was published by Play Stack who you may remember from the game Mortal Shell, Anybody?
Anybody.
Oh yeah, The Last Faith, Entropy Center and At the Case of the Golden Idol, which has been getting some good reviews.
Axolotl rolls in on our data set at the 825th most popular Rogue like game with 393 total reviews.
3:09
Colin, what's that one sentence description of this game that you're gonna give to your little frog babies to inspire them to take up arms?
Have you played Answer to the Gungeon?
Well, here's a game that's not quite as good as that, but kind of like it got him?
Yeah, maybe.
3:24
And I would summarize it as another universally beloved pick by Andrew Harshman.
This is, yeah, this is the trigger warning zone here of it's OK to like a game.
It's totally OK and all devs go to heaven and this is any any time that we have to preface it with that you know there's a there's a basketball that is flying down the hallway getting ready to be dunked in.
3:50
I I well, yeah.
I think that as we did our ratings before hitting that record button this game did not jive well with me.
But I had some questions here to kick us off with because the last game that we talked about like this, these Twin stick Rd. game I know have not been really Will or Collins jammed that much.
4:09
Now, remember when we talked about our Enter the Gungeon episode, we were pretty split on it where there was an element of like, yeah, you know, I don't want to spend all this time to like get good per SE and like reflex timings and all that.
And I get that.
But that makes total sense.
So I want to field it out to the group here.
4:27
Is it fair to compare Axolotl to Gungeon or our Binding of Isaac?
Rankings.
Yeah, absolutely.
Why is that?
It's the same underlying core mechanic.
What makes a game though, is not just one mechanic.
Now the mechanic I'm talking about is this twin stick shooter with the dodge functionality, picking up different weapons and and and synergizing that kind of thing.
4:48
What glues a lot of games together are distinct narratives.
Glues a lot of games together are.
Well, actually in this sort of style of game, honestly that's it.
And we've seen this before with what was the other one we did that was.
We have like fun mechanics, fun like gun mechanics.
5:04
Like Streets of Rogue was another example of this.
Like, there's an interesting narrative around like what are you doing?
Like, why are why, what is the twin stick thing that what is the mission?
Like all that stuff is like matters a lot for like, incentive to play.
And with Binding of Isaac you have a really compelling narrative like it's it's interesting.
5:20
It's a mystery you're solving.
You can say the same for end of the Gungeon, although I it didn't quite hit that same spot for me because the the narrative wasn't quite as compelling.
It's like what slay some big dragon thing or something like that.
It's a dragon.
They think you love it.
We're done in it.
Right, exactly.
But this one?
5:36
Fucking axolotls, Are you fucking kidding me?
And like, fucking childcare.
Childcare.
That's the main theme.
Not childcare, baby frog.
It's very different.
So not super compelling.
That's the that's the glue that's supposed to get all the twin stick shooter action like you know who hyped up for it.
5:54
And you can even look at like what was that of the Cult of the Lamb, the same principle twin stick shooter.
But like the narrative there was so much more compelling.
And that's like, that's really why the narrative in these things is such a big deal in my point, from my point of view.
Sure, that's the driving motivation keep you at it, whereas.
6:13
AK Solatal Axolotl it relies over relies the core like gunplay, which is admittedly good, and the the cutesy aesthetic, which is admittedly good but is not as enticing to encourage replay.
6:32
Certainly a good, solid narrative.
So I think, yeah, when?
When Andrew had suggested for us to play this game, a totally fair thing.
There's no judgment here on the podcast about judge, judge what people pick to play.
But I was a little hesitant to break open.
6:52
But I thought, you know what?
I'm not.
I'm gonna put those hesitations aside.
There's plenty of games that are mixed reviews on Steam that you know, turned out to be good for other reasons.
You know, maybe it got review bombed or something like that.
And I will say that this game does, yeah, it's aesthetic.
7:08
It does very well.
It controls well.
It feels good to play.
Oh yeah.
But I think there's maybe one major cardinal sin here and we, I don't remember if we talked about this in our what is big, what is a rogue like Fight Club episode?
7:23
But a principal tenant for these types of games, I feel like, has to be variety.
Indeed, meaningful gameplay impacting randomization.
Mm hmm mm hmm.
How much variety did everyone encounter in their playing of this game?
7:39
Indeed, yeah, that is a definite issue, which before we totally dunk on this game, as you said, trolls are great, animations are great with the exception of I mean menu theme, which isn't totally my cup of tea.
The music grips.
7:56
I'll be listening to the podcasts and I would like pause the podcast to listen to the like Cyber, future, Japan level music.
Music was good and the gunplay objectively good.
But in terms of variety, indeed as you say, there is not a ton to be had.
8:13
It gets better as you unlock more stuff.
And I did.
I did beat the game.
I didn't beat it multiple times, but I I I finished it and I think I might have left it AFK for a bit.
So, but I I played like, I think about 10 comparison.
Well, so like just in the variety of, like the gun drops, right.
8:33
Like the game starts and in your first run you encounter, you know of course your basic gun and that your AK and then what maybe like two or three additional guns which what was what was Y'all's experience with like encountering the secondary weapons.
8:48
They're all pretty boring.
Yeah, one of those basically just the regular gun again, but has maybe slightly faster.
Yeah, I think that's what it.
Was Yeah.
Which I think that that was that was my kind of take away too was like OK so, so.
Indeed.
9:03
And like the the, the, the difference, like power ups that you get are not they're oh man, the the the base power ups are like, so underwhelming.
And I think there's, what, three of them?
That are basically are practically the same.
Yeah, like trail fire.
9:19
Trail acid.
Exactly.
Like which?
I yeah, I'm sure mechanically there is a difference but there was very little perceivables between those so I was excited to to boot this game up for the first time cuz I thought like oh like the art direction here looks looks pretty rad.
9:34
I I like the idea of cute animals with firearm like yeah that seems funny let's let's give this a shot.
But there was something like, very kind of like, not unsettling but like weird at like the at like the opening cutscene where it's like axolotls are known for like, oh, it's so like.
9:53
And it starts with the what was it like?
A David David Attenborough over over voice, which I thought was kind of funny.
But axolotls are well known for their regenerative capabilities and for wielding AK $0.40.
But there was like a weird thing about like your your babies get stolen, but that doesn't matter because you have to eat food or something.
10:16
I was kind of, kind of lost about that, but.
Like a joke?
Yeah, like.
Ha ha ha.
Babies don't matter.
But eating my food?
That's unforgivable, and that's what the that's what inspires your player character to take up arms against, I guess, the rest of the Animal Kingdom question mark A.
10:35
Crab.
Yeah, what's the what's the end, boss?
Sort of thing here.
Toilet.
I mean, that's fine.
Indeed.
So I I rewatched the intro and this is sort of hinted at.
It's is in fact the final boss is some play on some combination of Axolotl and Cthulhu.
10:55
But also it is, it is revealed I would get to this complaint So early spoilers or this specific complaint.
I know there would be a lot of complaints which was the at first I was under the impression, oh the ultimate villain is the the the, the guy who's fishing at the pond at the end of the level.
11:16
Does anyone know what animal that is?
I'm not totally maybe it's a salamander.
That would kind of make sense.
But so he's the 2nd to last boss, or they are the 2nd to last boss and they are like mad at you as soon as you enter the arena And they start like talking and there's some dialogue and then they reference the fact that their fishing bucket is ruined and it's full of holes.
11:39
And now I'm gonna pump you full of holes and I'm like, what is this?
What are you talking about, salamander?
Did you steal his fish?
I I had no idea that you could steal his fish.
Oh, I definitely.
Like.
That, which I think is it speaks to a greater issue about the game.
I, I don't know did it.
How?
How did all of you figured out figure out to shoot the the the bucket in order to get fish?
11:59
You said it.
Was better not shoot my bucket and then I shot the bucket.
Oh, does he say that?
I mean, he's like, you better not touch my bucket.
Oh, I see.
It's one of those, you know, after me, prawns sort of situation.
Yeah, exactly.
You like?
I would never have thought of it except for there was like an explosive dialogue about don't touch it.
12:17
Interesting.
Well, I I missed that and as a result of the introduction to that, so I thought like, oh, maybe he's like the ultimate ending of the Salamander individual.
Anyway, yeah, so you fight like Cthulhu at the end.
All this, all this as well.
12:33
And in the intro video there are like.
Because all the axolotls are like sleeping, there's like tentacles that sort of show up around the screen.
So I guess, yeah, that's it, you know, So there is kind of kind of a hint of like, oh, there's some, like, mysterious boss force involved to some degree.
12:50
That yes, but there ultimately wasn't a whole lot to it.
There was kind of the suggestion of that.
I also thought that maybe there's some greater conspiracy having to do with the fisherman, fisherperson, salamander in the pond section.
But because part of the dialogue is like, oh, you just had to come in here and like mess everything up or something.
13:11
And upon doing some more research on Axolotl, the actual animal, I thought maybe perhaps there was some kind of, because they're sort of unique creatures in terms of like how they develop and an atypical creature in terms of their development, even even by like, amphibian standards.
13:28
So I thought perhaps maybe there's something going on there where like, there's such a unique creature.
All the other animals are in this like this.
A ball anyway.
Overthinking it, obviously, Yeah.
I think there's there's multiple aspects to this game that much like Cult of the Lamb it it.
13:47
I feel like this game's trying to do too much and doesn't do any particular element very well in that there's there's like the shooting mix shoot part and then there's the baby management simulator where the shooting mix shoot part.
Like, you know, it feels, it feels OK to like run around it like dodge roll stuff and shoot things.
14:06
But there's like, and especially coming from a a game like Gungeon where it's like, there's just, it's just overflowing with variety And there's just so much like, it's almost overwhelming how much stuff there to come to this game where it's like, well, OK like, yeah, I've gone through, like, I went through three runs and I was like, OK, Like every run is kind of the same from, like, the bullet part.
14:29
Let's go and, like, look at the cute little baby thing.
So like, as you're as you're going through this run, you know, it's a, it's an arena shooter.
You come into a a big square room with obstacles to hide around and there's raccoons with guns and, you know, little cute baby forest animals with knives and things, you know, as you would expect out in the forest for real.
14:48
And as you dispatch them, you are presented with multiple, multiple options.
So you know what?
What door do you want to go through to get some kind of reward of some sort that can be even like go and get a different gun like a shop room go and like get some health upgrade or some other thing.
15:06
Like, I'm struggling here with the with the different options because it felt like that was kind of it.
And even then I was like, all right well, let's see what what all the guns.
We didn't have any.
I think I saw through like all of the the six weapons you have to play at the start of the game before unlocking anything.
15:23
And I was like, all right well, there's clearly a way for you to unlock more stuff to have it fall in here.
But I don't know what that like.
Where's the vendor to like unlock this stuff?
It seems like the vendors that you go around to like unlock your your passive spells and like your your other up kinds of upgrades show up over time.
15:41
Like it's not a thing.
They're like, oh, they just drop it immediately compared to Gungen, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Gungen had like multiple of those vendors at the onset and like more of them showed up as you played, for sure.
But you had options of like, oh, I have this meta currency, let's go, let's go on a spending spree and get.
15:59
But in like three runs and like almost an hour of playing this game, like I didn't have A the ability to like purchase stuff and B like barely enough currency to like, buy one thing was like everyone else's experience.
There's a lot of stuff that got unlocked as, like, you could buy these things and it's like, cool, I haven't earned enough money yet to do any of it.
16:18
Like, I don't know.
Like, I want to buy other things like, well, Nope, can't.
Is that just 'cause we were bad?
Yeah, probably.
I don't know what actually triggers them showing up, but my recollection is that fairly quickly and and Gungeon has a similar process.
Initially you just have the shop key but the shop key has a fair amount of and then you unlock the the person you find you you you do have to do jump through some tips to to get additional and additional vendors to to show up.
16:44
It doesn't matter anyway.
Yeah, so there's like, there's a vendor who sells you guns that can potentially spawn in your runs, although still waiting, still waiting for quite a few of those guns to show up.
They have not appeared in any of my runs.
17:01
And perhaps that has to do with the axolotl that I chose and like which weapons specialty anyway.
And then what?
You get a, you know, there's a dog who will sell you additional passives that have the potential to show up.
You can grind your you can grind your babies into power ups.
17:18
Indeed.
So they're tears or something.
So, so yeah, there are there are unlocks to be had.
They they do show up.
But boy, they're like, it's not impactful enough at all.
And it wasn't until, like, my, my, my one of my final runs where I beat the game.
17:37
I guess it was the last couple of runs leading up to the game that I beat like where I was.
You know, 8 hours in finally finding some interesting synergy or synergies, pardon me, interesting combos, which is something that should be happening almost immediately like in in these sorts of games with these these types of these types of games.
17:57
That combination of course being the time bullets, which get bigger the longer that they're in flying through the air or something.
Anyway, it's like a little sand hourglass and.
The rocket launcher, which will basically just nuke the entire screen, practically very useful, but probably overboard.
18:16
Yeah.
There's also there's a vendor who will sell you.
I don't know if they sell you anything actually.
There's like it's like the baboon mafia or something.
The the baboon like organized crime people in the bottom left hand corner and they will like.
18:33
Show you information on the different, the different enemies and the different weapon and there's like a unique piece of artwork for each enemy.
And it's like, well, why, why did you bother making any piece of art for?
Not that, but maybe you can give the money, I don't know.
Yeah.
So the Colin, the crow that that you can buy permanent upgrades, Is that who you were referring to earlier?
18:53
Yeah.
How did?
Again, this is going to be something that I just clearly missed because I did not know to shoot the bucket and I also did not know how to get the heart currency.
You had to, like, bring the little babies over to the fountain and then it sucks away their happiness.
And how did you know that?
19:10
He told you in the first, Yeah, he told me you unlock.
Them completely missed it like well this crows not to be trusted.
I won't.
I never did it, but.
Interesting.
All right, well, that's on me.
I was.
I was worried.
A ton of fully grown axolotls and I had not siphoned off any of their heart energy, so I didn't have any hearts.
19:29
So I didn't have any hearts to spend on the permanent metaprecreation.
I was worried to do that because I thought it would be the interesting game mechanic of like, oh, I have to decide whether or not to sacrifice my baby indeed to get these permanent upgrades.
But it seems as though, correct me if I'm wrong, that you just bring them down to the crow and then like they just siphon their happiness away for the permanent upgrades, but you still keep the babies.
19:54
I think so.
So there's no real reason to like there does not.
Appear to be a downside.
I I also agree that like thematically, aside from like kind of a hint in the intro video, thematically it seems like the objectively wrong thing to do.
Like.
Especially with all the oh the cutesy little kawaii mini games you know they have going on.
20:14
It seems it seems like, oh, why would I want to siphon a way they're happy?
Well, you clearly don't care about them in the beginning because you're more concerned about your food being stolen than your baby's being eaten, so.
Indeed, I I will joke more.
Well, yeah, you, you, you, you sort of phrased that, Scott, as like sort of a question.
20:31
And the answer is you absolutely want to siphon off their energy because like frankly, I don't think you should even bother like raising them to fold maturity like they're not.
I I just used the stock axolotl for like most of the game and perhaps I messed up the the system of like feeding them the right food but like I tried multiple other axolotls a were not to my liking at all.
20:56
So once again, another system that seemingly fails to offer much for.
Yeah, can we talk about that a little bit more?
Because please, so I I'm coming into this game, I'm not hugely into twin fixtures and I have a Steam Controller so I can barely play them anyway.
21:14
Which I'll get that.
That leads to a different other complaint.
Uncompletely unregulated.
You know people pay big money for those same.
I is I Is that true?
Yeah, you could probably sell it for Boku Bucks and get like a like an Xbox.
Controller.
I would absolutely do that.
I'd buy like a real controller anyway.
21:32
This Axolotl mini game.
The little baby game.
So, so I'm already like, I'm coming to this game like I'm not, I'm not probably going to like the.
Active combat.
Part of it a lot, but I I can still objectively judge.
21:48
The rest of it is like, oh is this a well, a well done game?
Like looking at something like enter the gun gym.
Like this is a very well made game.
It's not for me, but it's a good game.
This game I'm coming into and I'm like, OK, so let's see, are the surrounding mini systems enjoyable?
Do they provide value the raise the little Axolotl mini game is?
22:07
Abysmal.
It's so bad.
I hate AK.
Abysmal.
I I I was like, well, and I were playing Rocket League and he was considering not playing anymore.
But he hadn't interacted with that system yet and I was like, no, no, you have to go play it.
22:24
It's so bad.
I'm excited for you to play it and see how bad it is.
I have.
I can't think of a mini game system that I have just liked more in like any video game.
Interesting talk more about that What?
So you.
Find so abysmal about.
22:40
There are like 3 different actions.
You're compelled to do them in order to like meta progress and.
And it's basically like, pick up this little baby.
It's shitting rainbows.
Put a diaper on it.
OK, cool, fine, whatever.
Oh, pick up a baby.
22:56
It's got you got to it.
Has to eat.
Feed it the spoon.
It bites the spoon.
Haha.
Funny.
And then it's like, what?
Two more?
And those are the that's the entirety of it.
Yeah, so there's more.
Yeah.
You you spray them off.
And there's one other one I can't remember.
Sure, sure.
But this, this, these all like increase the happiness level of the baby axolotls which you are collecting throughout your runs.
23:18
Right.
Which I don't intrinsically care about.
I don't particularly like the art style of it.
It feels very like infantile in all ways, both in the the style of the art and in the object of what you're doing with it.
It has no variety.
It is an actual chore.
23:35
And it feels like some, like I'm not the kind of person that can ignore those meta progression things.
Like I feel compelled to do it every run, especially because the little bird that's underneath it is like, better do this every time or they'll lose happiness.
So I'm like, OK, I have every time I lose a run when I'm feeling annoyed that I lost the run.
23:54
Now I have to go through this annoying task.
So it's like punishment on your punishment.
You don't find it rewarding.
It's not like the star of your valley go getting out there with the watering can and making sure all your plants are.
And I think it's like objectively bad game design, though, because absolutely there should be, you know, the the, the way these kinds of games work is you you finish running, you'd be like, man, I was so close, I want to do it again.
24:20
You get right back into it.
It's like, well, no, no, no, you can't get right back into it.
You have to go do your chores first.
That's a that's a great point.
It really does spoil.
Not that.
Not that there was much of that.
What is there an official term for this in rogue like design the one more run effect.
24:38
Like, not that this game has a huge score in that to begin with, but like on top of it, yeah, you got to go do your, your, your Axolotl care.
Yeah, so that there were.
There were.
When I was playing this game, there were two games that I was kind of playing off and on beforehand that like this game like actively pushed me away from playing this and towards those 'cause they do very similar things much better.
25:04
And that is a void ago and tiny rogue.
And void ago is like this.
Like weird.
Like completely like brain melting animated twin stick rogue like that looks like it was animated from like 1/2 Ren and Stimpy and a half ah real monsters episode that is just like completely overwhelming and insane.
25:28
But like it has only two guns that you switch between.
Much like this game but it has like such a different variety and like different way of doing stuff that I was like Oh my God this is like this is such a breath of fresh air and that has that one more run quality to it and tiny rogues like a totally different aesthetic very NES styled.
25:49
It's like any as Dark Souls means enter the dungeon it is it's like a very like Spartan square room with enemies and each encounter takes like 5 seconds or something.
It's crazy but like that also has a a much more like one more oh like oh, I died but I I got to do it again because now I know how this other system operates.
26:08
Like this game it felt very much of like where's the beef like there's got to be something here right?
And it it felt, it felt bad to compare this game against Gungeon because enter the Gungeon binding wise get been out for a lot longer.
They've had that much longer degree of pedigree to build up over time.
26:25
So it's like, OK, we'll compare Axolotl to to Void Ago.
Let's say a game that also came out this year and came out maybe I think like a few months before this one did.
But I'll get into the dev cycle in a second.
But Void Ago has a a weapon in it called an Axolotl axe, already a better pun.
26:48
And like that's that's the extent of that joke, right, where it's just like an A axolotl that throws axes and that's it.
This game to come back to the dev cycle bit a bit, came out in, let's see there was like a really successful Kickstarter for this game back in like I think 2021 or so.
27:08
I was very surprised to learn, yeah, that got like like 10X what it was asking for because they were asking for 15K and they got €132,000.
And the stuff on this was like daily runs, boss rushes, hacks, new game, plus mode, alternate biomes, alternate bosses.
27:26
I'm like, great.
These all sound like things that would fit well in the game.
Are they in here and then or Yeah, so so the Kickstarter was 2022, actually.
There was a closed beta in Q3 of 2022 and then this was the full release.
27:43
This was the one point O of the game was this year and I'm like.
Is there more?
Is there a road map OK?
There's a road map.
Yeah, like, road map notwithstanding, I'm like, well, what the hell did they spend all this money on, right?
Sure.
There's probably 130,000 is like not that much money.
28:00
Well yeah, OK, like granted, but where's the game?
Like there they they got like there's all this like collector's edition stuff of like a releasing the game multi platform.
Kudos.
Congrats that's a that's a big deal.
But like I wouldn't you would have to put a gun to my head to buy a physical version of this game to buy an art book, a key chain postcard set sticker sheet, a pin.
28:25
Like, come on like a.
Pin I mean, yeah, OK, but like you.
Have to wear the ribbon, Scott.
You have to wear the ribbon.
I don't want to wear the axolotl pin.
It felt like there was, there was a lot of stuff about this game that was like a neat idea that just like, Oh yeah, I don't know, we'll make it cute or something and then like release it as a one point O and then we'll move on to the next game.
28:49
And like, the reason why I'm coming down on this game so hard is because I thought, Oh, well, you know, if this was like a $9 indie game from like, you know, just the two devs that was released in Early Access, I'd be like, yeah, fine, like this game has got like some growing to do.
29:04
It's a baby Axolotl right now.
It's going to grow into a full one, right?
I think it's.
Axolotl is their explicit term for them, but I think this has been an established pattern from this dev studio where like looking at the Steam reviews for some of their other games, it's like the same kind of deal where like neat idea game releases and it's not really a whole lot of content.
29:24
Maybe they'll add more stuff, but that was like years ago.
So I'm not getting high hopes for this game, Unfortunately, 'cause I think that like, yeah, the, the aesthetic, I don't know, is like, it's cute.
Maybe it doesn't have like, that that much leg to stand on, but like there's just like, there's it.
29:41
It frustrated and like, made me angry the more that I researched this game of like, oh, so there's not more stuff coming.
OK And this game is more expensive than like Binding of Isaac and Entered the Gungeon.
So it's like, well, what what are we doing here?
Like granted, like 18 bucks is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of the universe, but like Enter the Gungeon is like $3 cheaper for like 500 times as much content.
30:04
So from an economic decision like what's like, what's the incentive of people to to like pick up this game versus something that's like half price with like twice as?
Good, Great question.
How much does Boy to Go cost?
Boy to go costs like $2.00 cheaper, OK?
30:22
Good name, Good name.
Easy to say, Easy.
Easy to parody.
During your intro at the beginning of the podcast?
Easier.
Yeah.
Well, so there is a road map.
It certainly does not.
However, even close to all of the things that you just mentioned in the stretch goals like started campaign My Oh my.
30:40
Well, that is indeed disappointing to hear about.
A glimpse of what could have been, perhaps.
Well, I found it.
I found a road map that has pretty much all that stuff in there.
Oh, really?
Oh.
OK, maybe not.
Supposedly posted a month ago maybe.
I glanced at the road map and I what I remember from the road map is a new Biome.
31:01
Daily runs new items, new enemies, new rooms, but like isn't.
Am am I getting the wrong impression?
Oh.
OK.
All right.
I mean, I'll believe it when I it's like a Star Citizen.
I'll believe it when it's there, like I will not.
31:17
I will not believe it until a second until I can literally play it.
It does not exist, and I don't care how many times you tell me it does.
So is would this be like the Star Citizen of Twin Stick Rogue?
Rogue Light games?
Is that does that seem like an apartment?
31:32
No.
It's got to raise like, what, 1000 times more money?
Indeed.
Well.
More than that.
I too share your aggravation, Scott, with the description.
It seems unfortunate.
31:48
And initially my observation about this game was like, oh, there's just not there just doesn't seem like enough content.
But then as I thought more about it and played more of it and got a little more critical with my opinion, it's like, oh, also it's a quality problem.
It's a quantity and a quality problem.
32:05
Good grief.
And the fact that both quality and quantity were not addressed in.
Beta.
You said there was a beta.
Yeah, there was supposedly a closed beta for this game, which in the world, like, God help you if you were like one of the beta testers of like boy, I can't wait for them to add more stuff like, oh God, like, I can't imagine how much less stuff there was for the closed beta.
32:27
But like, again, like if this was a game that was like, hey.
This is Early Access.
Yeah.
In Early Access, like I would totally buy that.
I would be like, yeah, that makes total sense.
But it just it doesn't feel like it compares because like when like especially and you see this all the time with like indie games that are being released by like the Dump Truckload on Steam every day is like there has to be like some something to like drive me to want to play this game and like the graphics are there.
32:55
Sure.
Yeah, like it's.
I think the like the graphical fidelity of this game is very good.
Like it, it looks for what they're going for.
It's not everyone's jammed, So what they're going for here, I think works very well for what they attempted to do and like the gameplay, like it feels like, competently programmed, but like, what am I supposed to do?
33:16
Like, that's where I feel like it.
It falls flat on its face and like drags across the asphalt.
In the Yeah, well.
That's that sounds about right to me.
I do declare there's so when I first started playing the game, I was thinking about the gun.
33:36
I was thinking about I was thinking about Hades.
And when and my first run I saw that there were three doors.
I thought oh interesting, the lads, the rogue, the rogues gallery was was very excited.
They very much enjoyed.
They put really held up this.
33:54
One of the core parts of hates is that this idea of choice and that at the end of rooms you get to make a pick, you get to make some kind of decision and work towards the build.
And at first I thought this Axolotl is doing the same thing I'm gonna make. 3 meaningful decisions.
34:11
And unfortunately, I realized very quickly that that choice of room and you know each, each level, each Biome is made-up of, I forget how many rooms, exactly 10 or something.
And at the end of each room you are, you are presented with some doorways and you go through and you get a different reward in the next room.
34:28
And yeah, very quickly I realized, Oh no, these are not, these are not significant decisions often times.
There will be only one door or there will be two doors and then when there are three doors, especially midway through the run, there's not much of A to be made like.
34:46
Most of the decisions are in like a subcategory of like.
Will this help my meta progression or will this help my current run?
And so like when I was doing my like.
My runs to actually beat the game.
I was so aggravated when I would get door picks that were all just meta stuff.
Well, I don't care about the meta story now.
I'm trying to maximize my current run and get to the next thing.
35:04
I don't care about adopting a new Axolotl, which has that annoying, you know, system that we've talked about.
You know, I don't care about getting more soup recipe items like I'm looking for.
I'm looking for the currents.
I'm looking for the, the, the special, you know, challenge rooms.
35:20
I'm looking for weapons, you know, etcetera, etcetera.
And.
Yeah, I was just like really, really unfortunate about, you know what you always talk about Will with the Key, the incredibly important thing of of choice and how this game also falls flat in there.
35:36
I have one weird petty complaint.
So while trying to play this on my steam controller and be like OK, this is annoying.
Fine, I'll just try to play it with mouse and keyboard, switch to mouse and keyboard.
I'm like.
35:52
Well, what's the key bindings for the mouse and keyboard?
Who can say?
There's no way to find out what.
There's no way to figure out what the key bindings are.
What?
What do you mean there's no main menu to look at?
The controller?
Nope.
What?
Yeah, I experienced that as well.
Mind mind boggling.
36:08
I was looking to see, well first I tried to see on the the controller like like I don't know, I might like switch around what my key bindings are.
Like I kind of want to click B instead of the button or whatever.
It's like that doesn't seem like it's there.
And then it's like, yeah there's no there's no thing that tells you what the key bindings are.
I I could not figure out what the like re heal thing was for a while.
36:29
I had to just click every button until I found it.
Yep.
Indeed, I I went to remap the controllers.
I'm like, well, that's a terrible button for switching weapons.
Like, I don't want to scroll up.
I I realize, you know, some people are accustomed to that.
It's that's a lot of FPS games, but it doesn't work for me.
Wait.
Didn't you use a controller?
36:44
You weren't you the one advocating for a controller?
I was advocating for a controller partially because of the also, primarily because I think it it feels pretty good.
It's nice and responsive on a controller, but crucially, there's more degrees.
36:59
Yes, this is it.
You're dodged with.
Yeah, this is, this is a core, a problem.
This is a big problem for me.
I'm playing the game, I'm getting the control around.
I'm like, all right.
And when the IT like the snap to the the the different like diagonal straight up and down the cardinal directions and the diagonals the snap to that was so incredibly strong that if if if an enemy was not directly on one of those lines you just couldn't hit them like you in order to get like that little bit of like adjust to get to that like you just couldn't do it.
37:30
And so mouse and keyboard was really the only I I think the only feasible way to play it with like any degree of or like to maximize your effectiveness on the on the on the battlefield.
I don't know if any of you all.
Wait a second.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait, wait, hold on, hold this on.
Playing on my Steam Controller, I didn't experience that at all because I have a mouse pad for the right thumbstick.
37:48
Perhaps the Steam Controller is the best way to we found.
The way to play AK to Lotto.
I mean I was about to say like I played this exclusively on the Steam deck, just sitting on the couch and like I thought it played fine.
Like I thought the like the dodge rolling and like the shooting and and like.
38:06
The aiming though, like the aim, like did it not snap to those directions?
Really hard for you?
I don't think so.
So I think, and I was bouncing around between a bunch of these different types of games too, so I feel like I would have noticed the aiming being egregiously bad compared to the others, but it felt like on par with the other ones as far as I could tell.
38:25
Maybe.
I don't know if there's.
Sorry Will, I didn't encounter the issue.
It was.
It was very intense for me.
Like, constantly.
I was experiencing that feeling of, wow, there's an enemy right there.
I wish I could shoot them.
Let me just let me just stand still and delicately try to like move the thing just in the right direction and it just like it.
Just snap on top above him, below him, above him, below him.
38:44
I'm just like, I can't actually shoot him.
It just pissed me off.
All right.
So so a little bit, a little bit of advocacy again for Tiny Rogues because I'll shield as much as I can here.
Any Rogues to Andrews Point has a method of re rolling your exit doors if you have like exit doors.
39:01
Like I don't want either of these options.
You have like different colored dice that you can roll through to be like I want to change the the vendor results or I want to change what the doors are.
I want to change like the the items that have dropped, that kind of thing.
Super cool idea.
And to Will's point about aiming, Tiny Rogues has an auto aim lock on feature which is pretty dope.
39:21
So it's like, oh, like I can play a twin stick shooter and not have to worry about being good at it and like, do pretty well, like, for me?
Yeah, exactly.
They're and it's like $4.
You can like reroll items in the shop, but again, you have to unlock it.
39:37
And I didn't unlock it for a while and it it was seldom that useful.
I I felt like I got burned, like almost every time I used Axolotl.
That's interesting about the controllers, so I, I, I.
I used APS 5 controller and I had an issue wherein like I had to change some steam settings to work properly.
39:57
So I I'm sure some combination of those variables like which physical controller you were using, what settings in steam were going on regardless, obviously just snapping to those you know very those resolution degrees is uncalled for is that it's not acceptable.
But now the reason I switched to controller was just because like when you were.
40:15
Planning a dodge roll, which is super critical in bullet Hail when you're traversing bullet Hell.
If you're using WASD, then you only have like 8 possible dodge directions, right?
So.
But if you have a joy.
Joy.
Yeah, it's a joy.
Absolutely.
Which I do have some nitpicky stuff about.
40:32
Some of the some of the boss patterns, I feel like, oh, look at that.
Wow, that's incredible.
Is that for Mechwarrior?
Yeah, actually it is literate.
This this is like for Mechwarrior from like 1995.
We are seeing a glorious vintage, very plasticky.
40:50
So yeah, good, good golly, good golly.
Hey, I have up at the top.
Scott, you had some questions for the crew.
I have a couple of questions.
As the person who I guess who feels kind of responsible for again another enjoyed and delightful gaming experience for for all involved.
41:11
I was I was curious, did anyone notice that this this feature existed and did anyone try it?
And was anyone considering trying the AXA little mode?
There is a easy mode that exists for people who are not, as you know, into the twitchiness.
41:29
And I considered it.
I chose not to because I didn't like that.
If I had liked the rest of the game, I might have, because I actually had.
I had trouble being the first boss.
I got to it like three or four times in a row and lost on like one hit point left.
And I was like, I have to know what happens after the first level.
41:47
Otherwise I feel like I can't be on the podcast.
And then I decided just to get good and beat it right.
There you go.
Well, I considered it.
Well that's that's more than I did.
I mean as soon as I was changing a fucking Axolotl's diaper, that was the game was dead to me.
I I honestly like I I I did.
42:04
I did like a few runs.
I changed a fucking diaper and I'm like, holy shit, I'm going to just rely on you guys expertise here because this game did not hook me.
I I didn't.
I saw the Axolotl option there.
Didn't look at it.
I saw that I could, probably I I might have.
42:19
I've been able to change my bindings.
Didn't care.
I'm just like, all right guys, this this is, this is, this is it hurts too much.
Andrew to to your point about difficulty modes, the difficulty modes is not something that we encounter very often in rogue type games specifically, but also I feel like with twin stick shooter rogues doubly so because it's like oh, it's just the one difficulty and like.
42:43
The death loop is necessary for you to progress the meta currency, which makes sense to some degree.
Another shill moment for Void ago.
Like, I was playing through that and I was playing on the Rogue difficulty, the hardest one by default because I'm a pro, of course.
And you know, I was doing all right.
42:58
But there's just like there's so much information to take in and it's, it's like it's the same style of game, but it's prevent.
It's presented very differently.
And I was like, all right, I'm kind of getting rolled here.
Let's dial it back a little bit.
Like, OK, now I'm starting to get my feet set.
But I kept losing to the to the final boss a lot.
43:14
Like, OK, let's turn this down to like, there's a different, like, explicit difficulty selector mode in it.
I'm like, all right, let's set it to like super noob easy mode so that, like, I can beat that first boss and, like, be accomplished in the game to some degree.
And it felt like it was just like an absolute cakewalk for like the whole game up until the final boss, which was still, like, comically difficult.
43:35
But I'm like, OK, well, like, I beat it with like, one heart remaining.
So that's that's OK like.
Maybe I know like the boss patterns now and stuff.
Like there wasn't that draw for me here because it was like, well, I've seen everything.
Like I know what this game has Axolotl has to offer now like what's the point of me playing on an easy or difficulty to like see the other bosses I guess will.
43:57
The one thing that you're missing, or maybe Colin too if you didn't beat the first boss, is the the Forced meme at the end of every time that you kill a boss of like.
It's it's like it was very out of place when I when I killed the first boss, the crab.
And then it's just like this weird, like like, I don't know, animation or screenshot that like drops in on the camera and he's like, whoa, what?
44:19
Where did this come from?
And it's very clearly like a re artistic styled version of, you know, the meme of like, the little girl who's like looking over her shoulder.
Mysteriously with the.
Camera the the fire sort of in the background like that was, yeah.
It's that, but with presumably your player character Axolotl, right?
44:38
Which I was just like, huh?
Like what?
Yeah.
Where did this come?
I did.
Beat the crab, OK and like you don't even light the crab on fire like the death animation is like the crab's knife or whatever flies up and like stakes it or whatever.
I for one, like those animation.
44:54
I I remember like, y'all remember the era of like having your friends over and being like, hey, let's not just play.
We're not just going to sit down and play this computer game.
I want to sit down and show you the victory cinematic that happens after a certain level.
45:11
Like I remember showing people, you know the StarCraft.
Oh yeah.
But I showed my, my but my.
Yeah, I I showed a bunch of people like the Amerigo Amerigos.
What is that the the famous.
I got your cold fusion right here.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
45:29
Cinematic.
So I I kind of it it it struck that same sort of chord it it sort of felt like an ode to that.
I I kind of liked those animations.
But I I agree that the theming was with the star and the first time it happened.
Yeah, it completely takes over the screen.
It's like whoa, what's happening.
Also interesting piece of trivia.
45:46
You can die during that during that.
That was.
I was really pleased about that.
Thanks, Game.
Interesting.
Well, yeah.
I, for one like that.
I, for one, sort of.
I found the axolotl rearing to be endearing.
46:05
Like, I thought it was kind of cutesy and fun and the first time I dragged a diaper over to obscure and mop up the rainbow which was shooting out of the butt of the baby axolotl, I was, I thought that was I I brought a a smirk to my face.
46:22
I'm like, oh that's kind of cute.
See clearly didn't work for anyone else.
The the biggest issue I had with the Axolotl here is that the the buttons seem like, totally messed up.
Like I I couldn't.
I couldn't quickly.
I wanted to try to like optimize running around and like doing the pet motion or whatever on all of them and then doing the and you can't.
46:40
I had to run away from little axolotls and run back and forth to get the prompt to show up and it was just like, but anyway lots of issues for lots of and then I had another question here for Yikes.
Yeah I'm sorry real quick with regards to the difficulty.
I think it's cool that it's like in there.
46:57
And I think to answer your question Scott, it's like why would you want to keep playing it.
Why would you want to you know thing done The Sprite work and everything in those animations and stuff I think are appealing to a certain crowd including me and like just getting to sort of like see all that stuff perhaps a reason to if you were not able to beat it on the normal difficulty you might change it to the lower deterrent.
47:16
But anyway.
But but the difficulty slider like we're discussing a whole ton of heap of problems with this game and it and I don't think we've really mentioned at all like the difficulty being a problem.
Like, it's great that they put that in, but it doesn't address any of the much more outstanding issues.
47:36
Say will, a question for you, if we need to call on your expertise, this is a shooting game.
What do you make of what did you think of the main menu artwork which is depicting a battle screen?
47:51
It's very like Duke Nukem 3D of like the axolotl is standing on top of a grassy Knoll, like shooting down at all the different woodland creatures.
I don't.
Recall this at all.
That's that's.
I'm apparently not able to copy it directly into the chat, so maybe this was a terrible idea, but.
48:10
Rate.
Rate.
Their guns indeed.
Well, never mind.
I can't take over.
But yeah, it's basically the Axolotl is firing a weapon that is I don't think in the game as far as I know.
And it's like this weird like Sten machine gun or Sten submachine gun looking.
48:27
Oh yeah, I I see it now.
I'm looking at a picture.
What?
What?
I just I wanted to get your take on the weaponry being displayed on this main manuscript.
There's no sight on that gun.
Oh, that's true.
It occurred to me and it's.
Just like a round stock and like yeah, it's I mean it's it looks like something like an AI would put together and call a gun at this point and it's like.
48:48
Oh yeah, yeah.
I opened up the menu and I remembered that music is good.
The music of this this game is good.
I want to give that a point but this is bad.
It it treads.
There's during the during the the cat mech battle, which is great.
Outstanding.
Love it there.
49:04
There are cat meows like with reverb on them like mixed in and outstanding.
Love it.
But yeah, my favorite part about the gun that the Axolotl has is that it's an angled like magazine type situation.
It reminds me of a Nerf gun that I bought for a young relative.
Anyway.
Anyway, pretty silly.
49:20
Also, crucially, he has a grenade, and this is something that I'd like to talk about very briefly.
And maybe this is like a problem.
That's the the game is so far gone that we shouldn't even bother with this discussion.
But like the fact that he's holding a grenade reminds me of something I was thinking about as I it's like the gameplay loop, the gun, the core gunplay feels pretty good to me, but I feel like there's just it's not quite there, that it's missing something.
49:44
And if there had been like a grenade button, which when I was doing my runs with the missile launcher, I found that to be pretty satisfying, like, yeah, they were so.
Like a special weapon or missile launcher.
Excuse me?
Yeah, a cool down special of like a grenade of some kind or some sort of additional extra move other than just like a a dash.
50:02
You know a dash or a dodge roll.
Because like let's face it the the the rooms are all pretty boring.
The like terrain and traps in the rooms are pretty boring.
There's explosive barrels which aren't terribly exciting either and or at one point if you're first being interested in the game there's they're talking about how you got to raise these Axel littles and some the chicken uses the line like pretty soon you'll have an army of Axel little and I must have mixed this game up with a different trailer the trailer with a different game because I could have sworn there was I'm like oh cool.
50:32
I'm going to have like a mob of little Axel Littles like like around me also shooting guns.
At some point I thought, oh, maybe you're going to literally build an army and that'll be part of it.
Like similar to like how you know, you know a schmucks game, you have your spaceship and there's you know, little attachments that that go on.
50:48
I thought the same I I I.
Had the same feeling.
I also thought it.
All right, well, here we go.
And maybe that's something they had planned as a future, future stretch, a super stretch goal.
So I don't know.
Anyway, your thought, your guys thoughts on like you think, yeah, I mean it should.
Is this game too simple, like the core gameplay, Like what?
51:05
What could have been improved and would that have saved?
It, you know, oh, I was thinking about this just before we hit the record button instead of like.
Like the the baby nursery thing, if you were like training your Axel Littles to be like a guerrilla warfare fighting army, like that would have been AI think like maybe tying into the aesthetic a little more and then also distancing itself away from Cult of the Lamb, like that kind of management simulation in a more unique fashion.
51:35
And then like, yeah, I don't know, give it some like, there's some, there's some kind of like.
Plot subtext here about like something going on in the animal Kingdom and like some kind of I don't know Banana Republic situation going on and like like lean into that more and I feel like if you if you use the axle littles as more of like not a child army but you know like let's say.
51:58
Child soldiers, let's do it.
You heard it here.
Freedom.
Fighters, you know, lean in that aesthetic more.
It might be more interesting, but.
Yeah, I think that that would be like my one.
Yeah, no, I think for for me, it's it's a stronger narrative.
Like, give me a reason to want to play like a lot of, like a lot of the the actual gameplay.
52:17
Did need improvement but like there's there's got to be that glue to the game and so that just means totally revamping the story and making it something that's more something better than maybe brotato something a little bit that doesn't have to be doesn't have to be overt either.
It can be something subtle.
I can slay the spy or because I always have to reference Slay the Spyer in every single podcast.
52:35
But like just give me something and and along with what you're saying though Andrew like.
In in in Cool.
To the Lamb and these other games that have similar sort of mechanics, Yeah, that's special.
Like there was like the magic function or whatever.
Where you're like in this game I can imagine like simple things like, Oh yeah, you you get to like you hit a button, you're special and you reflect bullets for a moment.
52:54
Or you're able to like, just jump to the other side of the map and like do a warp over here.
Or like, it's a temper, It's a 360 spin thing.
It's a, you know, whatever.
Like, there's a lot.
There's so many little mechanics that you could have added that like would have made it special and more synergistic with certain weapons.
53:11
And so just another layer of synergy because really the way the synergy works is like, oh, you have one thing, no possibility for synergy, 2 things.
You can start to have a little bit as soon as you have three things and then you can have like then all three things can be working together in a unique way.
It just adds so many more flavours for the the combat and the gameplay.
53:27
And so I think you're absolutely right with that.
And so you have narrative and some kind of special and I mean there's a lot of other things to work on here, but I don't think a twin stick shooter is really, ever really, really going to do it for me.
But I mean Binding Binding Advisor was good.
Like in, but these are things that would help.
53:43
Yeah, I'm pretty much in the same boat.
I think you covered most of the things.
I think.
I think it would just, yeah, you just need to have a all all of the things need another coat of Polish, another pass.
Now that should take the money and specifically I think, I think that the yeah, if I had to do.
54:01
One specific or a specific critique.
Maybe the starting guns need to be more different.
The the starting special guns all feel very similar to each other and to your main gun, your the base gun that has unlimited ammo.
54:17
So, like, there were plenty of times around going into a new room and like, well, I could choose this thing.
I could get a different gun, be like, I don't really care.
I don't need like all these other guys.
I like.
It doesn't matter what gun you gave me, I wouldn't care.
None of them bring me joy.
So just do that and then like add more guns in later or whatnot.
54:35
But you have to have at least a little variety at the start so that where you get the hook.
Just like it's a Halls of Torment, like had that done really well.
I think they introduced characters at the right frequency and they just like each one of them had like an actual unique and interesting sort of like mechanic to it.
Like one's a very shield focused 11 had magic and one had like you know 3 arrows firing and a cone.
54:57
And like they all had very special things.
And each one of these things, because it was so unique, LED well to the synergies that were generated with the other items.
And so that was one another thing if you wanted more spice towards these synergies, just make the the starter guns more unique.
What do we want to jump into?
Into rankings?
55:12
We're kind of kind of giving some thoughts here.
I think maybe I'll I'll dunk first 'cause I think I'm rating this game the lowest this game is going to roll in, just behind Low Magic Age and just ahead of Hackslash.
For me, I think like the pros for this game are that it's like it it didn't crash.
55:35
Like for me, it felt like the gameplay was like actually like fairly fluid.
You know, there weren't like any game breaking bugs or anything.
So like from a programming infrastructure perspective, like, yeah, it played, it played fine.
But I think that's kind of what you expect from every game.
55:51
Hopefully the thing that just like and and the art style, like the art style is, you know, again not everyone's jam, but I think for what they were setting up to do, I think they accomplished it and pat on the back.
The thing that like, really makes me, well, not I'm angry because it's a video game podcast.
56:08
Let's be real.
The thing that makes me disappointed about this game is like wasted potential.
And it feels like this game for like 18 bucks.
One point O feels like, hey, don't buy this game because like they they had, they had an interesting idea, but it's like again, coming back to void ago, like there's an axolotl.
56:28
And that's the extent of the joke.
And this is like, hey, what if that was like the whole game and I don't think that that really has enough legs that kind of carry it.
If this game was like half like the solution here I think slash the price in half, put this game out on earth, like change it to early Access and like long term support it.
56:46
I think there could be something here.
But looking at the other games that I've rated on here, I don't think it would be better than maybe Brotato on my list.
Generously speaking, like Cult of the Lamb is just ahead of Brotato on my list and Darkest Dungeon Two is just ahead of that.
57:01
So maybe it would be in good company, but I don't.
I don't see it getting any higher than that from like a theoretical maximum.
So for me, yeah, it's going to, it's going to rate in as my 31 out of 35 games that we played.
Yep, it it was a game.
I'll get it out of the way here.
57:17
Yeah.
Yeah let's yeah 3 out of 10 it's it's that puts it at rank 30 out of the 35.
I think I like I said I just the the diaper thing hit me real soon and real, real quick and I just the twin stick shooters.
57:35
I need that narrative.
I've already said it.
I've already said all the criticisms I have.
It's it's a game.
We played it. 4 out of 10 ranked 29 out of 35.
That's all I have to say about it.
Andrew, bring us home with some positivity here, some positivity.
57:51
Well, let's see.
Axolotls have been popping up in my feed, like more and more.
I feel like there's kind of a they've become more present in the zeitgeist in the last few years.
They're Minecraft now, right?
58:07
That's.
Them in Minecraft, Yeah, yeah.
They are sort of very unique creatures I referenced earlier and I feel like, you know they're they.
This game unfortunately doesn't bring much uniqueness to the table.
58:26
It doesn't really play on.
It doesn't doesn't take that Axolotl inspiration and do anything interesting with it unfortunately, because apparently I forget the exact term.
But it apparently axolotl they come to maturity without actually going through a proper like amphibian metamorphosis and like come out of the larval stage.
58:47
Like you know, a frog is like a tadpole and then some weird like horrible in between and then like eventually makes it to a frog, but like the the axolotl like doesn't properly turn into.
A salamander, which is like sort of what it's it, it is related to or whatever.
59:03
And in fact there is sort of there is half half the Internet including myself up until recently seems to think that like if left unchecked and Axolotl will just naturally evolve into a salamander and like keep an eye keep tabs on them make sure they don't do that anyway.
59:19
So this is to say like I I wish that this game did something more interesting.
Again, Axolotl, very unique, could have been a unique interesting game but and and the the Kickstarter campaign gives us like, yeah, but I mean there is a certain charm to this game I think and perhaps on a very severe Steam sale this could be potentially a recommendation I might make to someone.
59:44
But in its current state it's tough to say that the positivity I guess is that I am rating it significantly higher than my fellows here.
Originally the big sort of debate in my mind was so, so here's it's like.
1:00:00
The the base, if you, if you like white, boxed both games and just like gave me a room with some stuff to shoot at.
Like I think the gunplay in Axolotl is more fun for me than Binding of Isaac, But obviously I'm not going to say that it's better than Binding of Isaac.
1:00:16
That's ludicrous, ludicrous.
So I mean it's it's below Binding of Isaac.
And then I was I was having the more that we talked I think I'm going to have to change my rating.
So I had it at number six right above one way hero, 1 directional hero, one way hero, one way Heroics.
1:00:33
There we go.
But I I think yeah one way Heroics is is fundamentally a better game.
It understands game design better.
So I'm going to drop it down to my #7 which I think it makes it right above Eldridge perhaps I'd have to double check.
But anyway there you there you have it.
1:00:51
Yeah.
You know, cute, fun to shoot guns and things like that Perhaps you know, I I want to have faith.
Give give the devs the better for the dot.
Perhaps at the end of that road map a better package.
Well, to round us out with some other game recommendations, if if you're tuning into this episode, you're like, yeah, you know, like, oh, I I meant to mention as part of my review, the game lacks a lot of content.
1:01:18
Got that in?
The simple games, similar games We talked into the Gungeon, obviously.
Binding of Isaac, obviously.
See our previous episode, Pineapple Smash Crew, for something that's maybe a little.
Well you know solo dev effort.
But I like the yeah, I thought Pineapple Smash Girl had a dope soundtrack.
1:01:37
Cult of the Lamb very similar and it's kind of babysitter mechanics.
Stay tuned Episodes.
I I harped very positively for VOY To Go and Tiny Roads which I think you could probably get both for the price of this game.
A game that no one has ever heard of but I'll I'll mention anyway.
1:01:55
Called Null Vector.
It's like an 80s.
It has like this 80s arcade game aesthetic.
And it's very similarly kind of designed to this game where it's like a twin stick shooter but like more interesting game design concept.
We have our for sure stay tuned and a half star of Providence game.
1:02:13
At some point I'll I'll convince everyone to play and love formerly titled Monolith Nuclear Throne.
I think Andrew, you've played that before.
I think Andrew, you've also played synthetic with AK Atomic Crops I think has similar kind of ideas to this game, but.
1:02:29
But maybe, maybe better execute.
And then of course Hades in terms of door, door selection, reward stuff.
The best in class example of yeah, all sorts of all sorts of fun stuff.
Come down the pipe real quick if you would, or if you want to e-mail in your angry thoughts about why axolotls are in fact the best reptile you can send those angry emails into groggpodzone@gmail.com.
1:02:55
It's a reptile.
I thought it was a amphibian.
Wow.
Get biology.
Are they not the same thing?
Are reptiles not amphibians?
What are you from?
Kidding me, right?
Now.
Oh no.
Well, time to hit.
Just get kicked off my own podcast.
Oh my God.
1:03:11
Serious.
We're on Mastodon at Grogpod and our website where you can find all of our details about what defines the amphibian Kingdom Grogpod dot zone.
We're we're real close.
We're real close to the end of of this season of episode and our next one to kind of anchor out this season before we get to a rogue like playoff where we talk about all of our top games of the year in an elimination style tournament bracket.
1:03:41
Our last game that we're going to cover is Drum Roll.
Please Dead Cells Will.
'S.
Favorite platformer genre?
Oh no.
Which I specifically picked because I was like, you know what?
I know Will is not the biggest fan of platformers, but if there's one game, if there's one game that will, like, at least give Terraria a good name.
1:04:04
Terraria is that game.
Well, this is like if Terraria, but like blood everywhere.
So it's basically the same thing today.
So Dead Cells is our next episode.
And in the meantime to play us out from this one, I normally have a Google Doc note that says something related to the game, but I'll find some music, music related to the reptile Kingdom and and you know this is probably about the that you would expect from a game, from a model.
1:04:32
But anyway, so yeah, play out music.
Play out music.
1:04:51
This isn't it look excellent.
1:05:21
The.
