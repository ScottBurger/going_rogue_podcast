00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:15.849
Andrew Harshman: Thank God you're here, because honestly, we were… at least, I was worried for a while, like, we're not gonna have enough to talk about, and I'm happy that, in addition to Scott, we're gonna have, two! We're gonna have a total of two…

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.459
Andrew Harshman: Spelunky veterans who know what they're talking about here on the show.

3
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.990
Scott Burger: Saturday.

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.620
Colin: And one amateur, and one… just observer, really.

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.680
Colin: Just color commentator.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.670
Scott Burger: Okay, counting down for editing spacing…

7
00:00:39.370 --> 00:01:04.329
Scott Burger: Greetings, friends, and welcome to a big 75th episode of the GrogPod Roguelike Podcast, where each episode we rappel into a roguelike game filled with traps and terrors, steal the golden review statue head, and escape with treasure in tow to revisit it at the end of the year, in our end-of-season recap deathmatch mode, if it scores high enough. I am your derpy

8
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.450
Scott Burger: pug, host of the podcast, Scott Berger.

9
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.319
Scott Burger: And with me are my fellow spelunkers!

10
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.920
Andrew Harshman: Well, howdy kid, this is Andrew Harshman, but this episode you can call me Wisconsin Johnson at your service.

11
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.350
Colin: And this is Colin, I'm a skeleton on the floor that sometimes pops up.

12
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.149
Woody: Hello, and I'm… I'm the resident lunkhead, Woody Siskowski.

13
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.780
Andrew Harshman: That's right, this is a… this is a guest star episode. We got Woody with us.

14
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.990
Andrew Harshman: To, tell us all that we need to know about.

15
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.290
Scott Burger: We had to bring in….

16
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.730
Andrew Harshman: worse.

17
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:56.529
Scott Burger: We had to bring in the heavy plasma cannons, for this one, for a highly requested listener request week, also, 75th episode and a listener request week, doubling up, with, if you, didn't check the title of the episode before downloading it, Spelunky, released…

18
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:11.440
Scott Burger: in 2008, question mark? As a freeware game, December 21st, 2008, if you could believe it. But we're playing the remaster version that debuted on the…

19
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:26.880
Scott Burger: Ask your grandparents, the Xbox Live Arcade, July 4th, 2012, and then coming to Steam a year later in August 2013, and then PlayStation 2013, and finally a Switch in 2021.

20
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.900
Woody: Okay, so you're saying that for 4th of July, if I'm not feeling particularly patriotic, I can just celebrate the anniversary of Spelunky?

21
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.340
Scott Burger: Yes, exactly. Wonderful. It feels like the 4th of July.

22
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.980
Andrew Harshman: Yup.

23
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:56.349
Scott Burger: This was made, developed and published by the, I think now, it's, I think it's easy to say now, legendary, Moss Mouth, which at the time was a whopping 3 people. The legendary and award-winning, at that time, as well, ….

24
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.620
Woody: Did they take… did they take away his awards?

25
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.239
Scott Burger: Well, I mean, no, but, but, like, Derek Yu.

26
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.360
Andrew Harshman: Well, yeah, they took them and they put them in this underground installation. Got it. Sort of a temple of sorts.

27
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.630
Scott Burger: But we have a, kind of an all-star cast here of, of…

28
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:32.839
Scott Burger: well, I mean, if you can call three people an all-star cast, Derek Yu, who just won the Indie Game Fest, grand prize with, a game called Scrolling… Aquaria, the year before, Spelunky 2008's release, Andy Hull, who's a programmer friend of Derek's.

29
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.720
Scott Burger: And Eric Shirk.

30
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.599
Scott Burger: if I'm pronounced… I guarantee I'm pronouncing his name wrong, but, a… a legendary chiptune artist, all came together to… for this Xbox Live

31
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.989
Scott Burger: release, and then, Mossmouth then put out Spelunky 2 in 2020, September 29th, 2020, and most recently.

32
00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:07.950
Scott Burger: a… if you can believe it, a stay-tuned and a half for this program. I won't torture you guys with this coming up next week, but, UFO50, it was worth the wait, September 18th, 2024.

33
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.940
Scott Burger: More on that, to come at some point, but, ….

34
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.700
Woody: But UFO 50 isn't part of the Spelunky canon, right? It's just another high-quality Derek Yu project.

35
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:31.139
Scott Burger: I don't know if you… if you count Campanella 2 as… as in that canon, but anyway, anyway. Tune in to our UFO 50 episode when we eventually do it. Spelunky, your average player of Spelunky, has about 33 hours of gameplay in it.

36
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.499
Scott Burger: And surprisingly, Spelunky, climbs the rope of our Steam popularity rankings at the 81st

37
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:45.739
Scott Burger: most popular roguelike game on Steam, with 16,349 total reviews.

38
00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:56.699
Scott Burger: Woody, What is your one-sentence journal entry description for what one does in this legendary roguelike platformer?

39
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.060
Woody: Alright.

40
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.740
Woody: Explore procedurally generated caves Watch out for spikes!

41
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.770
Andrew Harshman: Yup.

42
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.179
Woody: That's, … and how many exclamation marks do you put on that sentence? Yeah.

43
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.460
Andrew Harshman: Many as possible.

44
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.139
Woody: Yeah, this is a real, …

45
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.359
Woody: This is a real more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts type of game, you know, where, like, it is composed of essentially the simplest

46
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.260
Woody: possible premise?

47
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.099
Woody: And, … one of the best executions. Like, this is a game with…

48
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.669
Woody: Very little flash, and a lot of substance.

49
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.589
Scott Burger: Yeah, and I think that, like, this game, 100%, I agree on that on all fronts. It, like…

50
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.500
Scott Burger: There's maybe a trap with roguelike games nowadays.

51
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.700
Andrew Harshman: Many, actually.

52
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.490
Woody: Yeah, some shoot arrows, some of them shoot spikes….

53
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:12.260
Scott Burger: … with scope creep, where, like, oh, like, let's build… let's build a game that's, like, this very systems-heavy thing, and let's just cram more and more shit into it until it becomes NetHack, and it's just become this…

54
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:19.339
Scott Burger: incomprehensible nightmare of, like, Sakaban levels, and sure, let's just, like…

55
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:33.209
Scott Burger: have, like, all these other, like, things going on. I think, like, in terms of scope, and, like, something that is, like, scoped to something that's just, like, this is the game, this is its scope, I think Spelunky just slam-dunks it on…

56
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:40.900
Scott Burger: what it is, what it achieves, and what it does with, like, the parts that it has. Which isn't… which isn't a whole lot, which we'll probably get into.

57
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:52.020
Woody: So, I'm gonna… I'm gonna throw out, like, a thesis, an op… an opening paragraph, you know how teachers, they tell you, you, like, start your opening, and then you work forward, and then you restate. So, I hope that…

58
00:06:52.020 --> 00:07:04.429
Woody: by the end of this podcast, we'll revisit this question. I think that you could make, like, an argument that Spelunky is one of, like, the definitive video games. Just, like, period.

59
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:12.470
Woody: Like, if you were to give somebody, like, if someone was like, I want to know what video games are, give me

60
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.990
Woody: 5 video games to play.

61
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:23.650
Woody: that are representative of everything that video games are and can do. I think you could cover a lot of ground giving them a copy of Spelunky.

62
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.099
Scott Burger: So here's maybe a pivoting question off of that for you, Woody. Would you consider Spelunky, like.

63
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.919
Scott Burger: Maybe… maybe not the, but, like, one of the top 3-5, like, standard bearers of… of all of roguelike games.

64
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.800
Woody: Yes, I would, except…

65
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.009
Woody: I… and I mean, I'm sure this is true for a lot of your listeners, and, you know.

66
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.529
Woody: like, I don't think that… my knowledge of roguelike games doesn't date back

67
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.759
Woody: To, you know, the 80s, when, like.

68
00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:03.870
Scott Burger: Rogue was a game on PC. Like, this is one of the earliest games that I played that had procedurally generated levels.

69
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.910
Woody: ….

70
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.189
Colin: I mean, I think that there's basically, like, the new generation of.

71
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.590
Woody: Right.

72
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.420
Colin: or the new Renaissance start as.

73
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.410
Woody: The rogue, if you will.

74
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.789
Colin: Exactly, starts in…

75
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:30.350
Colin: 2007-ish? Right. I feel like. About the time that original Spelunky came out. Yeah, I mean, I feel like the 2007 to 2012 period had a lot of the foundational games that people

76
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.089
Colin: built on. Whether or not they were good, which, we might have a strong disagreement on that on this one, but….

77
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.630
Woody: That's fine.

78
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:44.090
Colin: But I wouldn't disagree that this was absolutely foundational and influential on so many other games that came out.

79
00:08:44.090 --> 00:09:00.299
Scott Burger: I think it's important to stage set a little for, like, where was the state of rogue games in, like, the early 2000s? Because if we're comparing, like, 2008 Spelunky and why it was so influential, like, this is your list of, like, most influential rogue-like games of the time. Like, Rogue…

80
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.230
Scott Burger: we're not even talking rogue lights, like, that's not even a twinkle in Roguedom's eye yet. We're talking, like, the biggest release through, like.

81
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:23.499
Scott Burger: through this decade is, like, up to 2004 is, like, maybe Doom the Roguelike? So, like, lots of free, open, open source software stuff, like, the next year comes out Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Red, Blue, Rescue Team, a stay tuned and a half.

82
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:29.990
Scott Burger: Which, like, you could argue that Mystery Dungeon games are maybe their own thing, but I feel like it's close enough

83
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:43.959
Scott Burger: to procedural generated stuff, and it sold, like, I don't know, 6 million copies or something? Like, you really can't ignore that level of legacy, but it's a turn-based, very slow, very grindy RPG-type game.

84
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:55.210
Scott Burger: That same year you have, FATE, usually in all caps, that comes out, which is like… it's like a crappy, like, like, Diablo at Home game for kids. …

85
00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:05.740
Scott Burger: That, like, people have strong nostalgia for. I played the remastered version at PAX, was not impressed. The next year, 2006, you have Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup coming out, which…

86
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:14.919
Scott Burger: potentially a stay tuned. 2006 also marks the age of the first release of, Slaves to Armok 2,

87
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.570
Scott Burger: Dwarf Fortress.

88
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.629
Woody: Oh, sure.

89
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:23.880
Scott Burger: Also, the, the first roguelike game ever on Steam that everyone knows called Uplink, …

90
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:43.320
Scott Burger: 2007 has Pokemon Mystery Dungeon's sequel, Explorers of Time slash Darkness, that comes out. And in 2008, Spelunky lands on the scene, and it's like, oh, shit, I didn't think that, like, you could actually take mechanics from these Rogue games and put them into something real-time since, I don't know, what, like, ToeJam and Earl?

91
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.640
Woody: Okay.

92
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.039
Scott Burger: 93. Like, that's how big of a gulf it's, like….

93
00:10:47.040 --> 00:11:03.530
Woody: ToeJam, and Earl is not a game that, like, asks you for precision. Like, that is… you know what I mean? Like, it's not a turn-based, menu-based game, but you're essentially walking around a isometric world, like, not without any real combat.

94
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:20.010
Scott Burger: Right. And, like, this… this kind of… and so, like, this is 2008, it's, like, blowing up because it's a freeware game, and between 2008 and Spelunky's, PC release, we have Binding of Isaac, releasing in 2011, FTL 2012,

95
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:38.729
Scott Burger: Rogue Legacy comes out, let's see, June 2013, and then Spelunky HD on Steam comes out August 2013. So technically, I guess, like, Spelunky HD comes out on Xbox Live Arcade sometime before Rogue Legacy, and I actually don't remember if Rogue Legacy came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

96
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.929
Scott Burger: But Rogue Legacy comes out, like, let's round it up, a year later.

97
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.690
Scott Burger: And I feel like Rogue Legacy has just kind of, like… Eating Spelunky's lunch, maybe?

98
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.570
Woody: Well, I agree in some ways, except I think…

99
00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:11.110
Woody: I think Spelunky was just in a different lunch line. I think that Spelunky was in, you know, came out, and people were like, oh, this is great, you know, Spelunky HD, you know, really clicked, it's a great game, but I think that some people, like…

100
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:19.879
Woody: you know, it is a game with a lot of friction, in the sense that you can boot up Spelunky and you could be dead within 30 seconds.

101
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.340
Woody: Which is, you know, for people who aren't…

102
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:38.190
Woody: that is not a selling point. They might just be like, you know what? I've played this game for 4 minutes, and I've died 5 times, so I'm just not gonna play this game. And I think Rogue Legacy….

103
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.749
Colin: I bounced off it pretty hard, and I was looking, and I was like, alright, I have an average runtime of 3 minutes.

104
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.150
Andrew Harshman: And so you bounce off it into….

105
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.559
Colin: 22 deaths in… In, like, an hour and 10 minutes.

106
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.050
Scott Burger: So that's….

107
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.140
Colin: Yeah, this is, like, rough.

108
00:12:53.140 --> 00:13:11.109
Woody: No, and that sounds right, and I think that Rogue Legacy was the game that said, hey, Spelunky's doing a lot of super cool stuff in terms of integrating, like, procedurally generated Rogue mechanics into a retro platformer. Let's steal that idea and add, you know.

109
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.739
Woody: What, you know, is now roguelite mechanics, where you have this, ….

110
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.409
Scott Burger: like, progression systems.

111
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.969
Woody: Yeah, well, what's… what's the term of, like, advantages that carry over from run to run?

112
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.159
Scott Burger: progression, right? Or, or like a, like a.

113
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.040
Colin: Meta progression.

114
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.019
Andrew Harshman: Meta progression. Yeah, those are… yeah, right, right.

115
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:39.450
Woody: I think that the things that Rogue Legacy did, of having this meta progression, other games sort of built on that, because they're like, oh, now we can just…

116
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.419
Woody: We don't have to worry about

117
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:49.639
Woody: like, Hades is a great example of this. Because, like, Hades is a great game, and it is a very difficult game.

118
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:57.080
Woody: As is, like, Dead Cells, but because they have these elements of meta-progression.

119
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:05.360
Woody: They can leave the game as difficult as they want it to be, but if you keep playing it, you will beat the game.

120
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.920
Scott Burger: Right.

121
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:17.949
Woody: Like, like, Spelunky has none of that. There is no natural element to Spelunky that makes a run that you do 10 hours in naturally easier than the run you do when you first boot up the game.

122
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.429
Andrew Harshman: Say for your own muscle memory.

123
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.640
Woody: Well, exactly.

124
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.880
Andrew Harshman: raw skills.

125
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:33.430
Woody: And that's part of my argument of why this is one of the definitive video games. Because, like, is there any game that has made, like, a better case

126
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.029
Woody: For you just getting better at the game.

127
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.040
Scott Burger: Dark Souls.

128
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.949
Colin: I mean, I feel like this.

129
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.420
Woody: But….

130
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:55.049
Colin: when I've been thinking about it, it's as, like, oh, this is… I put it in the same, like, VIN diagram cluster as the Dark Souls-types games, where it's just… one of the goals of the game is to increase your personal skill level at it, and, like.

131
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.160
Scott Burger: Well, I guess also….

132
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.420
Colin: measure of progression. And this came out well before, well….

133
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.290
Andrew Harshman: Came out June…

134
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:10.989
Andrew Harshman: for Demon's Souls. Demon's Souls came out… well, I'm not sure if it came out in Japan in 2009 or in the US, but around this time.

135
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.360
Scott Burger: But it felt like that era of gaming.

136
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:32.619
Andrew Harshman: The reason I know that is that I just looked it up, because I'm curious, like, hey, when all this was happening, what games was I playing? Because I wasn't really playing many roguelikes, I was playing, like, Left 4 Dead 2, Uncharted 2, Infamous, Demon's Souls. Anyway, sorry, I know this is going back a ways.

137
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.469
Andrew Harshman: When did the actual popular version of this game come out?

138
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.480
Woody: When did everyone… 2012.

139
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.000
Andrew Harshman: Yeah.

140
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.920
Andrew Harshman: 12 on Xbox.

141
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:48.240
Woody: Xbox Live Arcade. And this game had a weirdly super, like, Spelunky HD, which is pretty much, I think, when you space Spelunky, this is….

142
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.650
Scott Burger: where people's mind would go to with Splunk HD. Right.

143
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.440
Woody: The Switch version of Spelunky HD didn't come out until, like, 2020.

144
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:10.199
Woody: Like, this game has a super timeless quality to it, like, if Spelunky 2 didn't… like, if there was never a Spelunky game up to this point, and then Spelunky HD came out this year.

145
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.560
Woody: Like, I still think it would totally be…

146
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.120
Woody: Its own super cool, kind of revolutionary thing.

147
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:28.889
Scott Burger: Yeah, and I think it kind of comes with this wave of, like, hard games are cool again, with, like, like, I've never played it, but Woody, I'm sure you've played I Wanna Be the Guy.

148
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:29.510
Woody: Yeah.

149
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:39.450
Scott Burger: Between that or, like, like, Super Meat Boy, and yeah, like, Demon's Souls Dark Souls, it was like, oh, like, you're not cool until, like, you've beaten Dark Souls.

150
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:52.240
Woody: A couple of things on that. I think that I Wanna Be the Guy, for example, is its own kind of other genre, because that is a game that is deliberately designed to hit you with cheap death as, like, a joke.

151
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.530
Scott Burger: like, Kaizo Mario.

152
00:16:53.530 --> 00:17:08.299
Woody: Yeah, which is not a bad thing, but it's like, hey, we're going to require a level of precision that is sort of beyond what any reasonable player can expect. And I don't think that Spelunky goes there.

153
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:14.079
Andrew Harshman: I'm not convinced that Spelunky isn't that far off at times, but I get what you're saying.

154
00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.369
Woody: I went for the….

155
00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.509
Andrew Harshman: the ground up to do that.

156
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:24.339
Woody: chime in on, … I do think that the Dark Souls comparison is reasonable, but to me, the difference maker is…

157
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.690
Woody: I remember being frustrated in the original Demon's Souls, and then looking up builds.

158
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.280
Scott Burger: Hmm….

159
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:45.490
Woody: like, oh, this is… this is an effective weapon to use based on its stats, and then I just built around that weapon, and then I cruised through the rest of the game. Like, Spelunky, you can look up what some items do.

160
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.600
Woody: But you can't really look up.

161
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.310
Colin: How to be good at it.

162
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.040
Scott Burger: Got it.

163
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.120
Woody: Yeah, yeah, to some extent, and even, like.

164
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.989
Woody: Enemy patterns are just much more…

165
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.609
Woody: I don't know, things feel much more…

166
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:15.550
Woody: bare bones in Spelunky, like, there's so many elements of Dark Souls that… or, you know, just games in general, where I always wonder, like, am I getting better at the game, or am I simply memorizing

167
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.029
Woody: The challenges that the game is throwing at me, because it's the same every time.

168
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.480
Scott Burger: Right.

169
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.400
Woody: Whereas I feel like in Spelunky, you just kind of…

170
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.800
Woody: Have to just be getting better at the game.

171
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:40.069
Andrew Harshman: Indeed, unlike a traditional platformer, like, classic Mario or, I don't know, Mega Man, let's say, Battletoads.

172
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.580
Woody: Sure.

173
00:18:40.580 --> 00:19:00.270
Andrew Harshman: You… you cannot memorize the level, critically, because it's randomized. You can't, you know, figure out, oh, you know, I'm gonna do this jump in this way, and I'm going to utilize this item, and… and, you know, just sort of go through the level by memory until you get to a new part, or the part that has, you know, been

174
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:07.090
Andrew Harshman: been challenging you. And … It is….

175
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:23.350
Woody: I wasn't sure how I felt about that at first. Yeah, that's fair. I mean, there can be some procedural bullshit. Like, I was doing a run where there was an arrow trap that was pointing directly at a store, like, a store.

176
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:30.299
Woody: So, if I drop down to go to the store, that arrow trap trigger was gonna trigger…

177
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:43.050
Woody: Yeah, so I'm like, oh, I'll just drop a rope. And so I just dropped the rope down there, it shot the arrow into the store, and then the shopkeeper went nuts and just destroyed me, because that's what they do. And I was like, hey, that seems like….

178
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.230
Colin: It's your fault that he got shot with the arrow, so….

179
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:54.659
Woody: No, it was 100% my fault, and that's what I realized, like, first I was bitter that, like, oh, I can't believe an arrow trap spawned right there, they shouldn't let that happen, but, like.

180
00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:14.479
Woody: I should have known that that was gonna… gonna happen, and then I had a choice, which is… just don't go to that shop, just go around the other way, which is, you know, the kind of choice that you face in a roguelike all the time. Like, that's what roguelikes are built on, is this idea of how much do I want to risk in this run.

181
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:22.200
Woody: Or do I just want to bypass it? So as far as… I should have just recognized that as, oh, that is just not a shop that I want to go to.

182
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:29.249
Scott Burger: You could also, like, blow up the arrow trap from, like, behind it. Yeah, or I could have jumped down in front of it and taken, you know.

183
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.499
Woody: Use my body as a shield.

184
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.590
Scott Burger: Get down, Mr. President.

185
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.910
Woody: Yeah.

186
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.360
Colin: So….

187
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.730
Woody: One second.

188
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:39.200
Colin: So I have a… before we get too far into this episode, could one of you guys who has played this game

189
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.270
Colin: significantly further into completion than I have. Yeah. Just give me a… A rundown of, like.

190
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.860
Colin: what are you… just a run through a run for me, because I… I…

191
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:58.600
Colin: I'll say I bounced off this game pretty hard. I never made it past the… the mines. Yeah, no, round two….

192
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:05.300
Andrew Harshman: Bounced off it, into an explosion, into a spike trap. Am I right, folks?

193
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.310
Woody: There's a page on the Spelunky wiki called Yet Another Stupid Death.

194
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.179
Andrew Harshman: That is, like, ….

195
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:17.769
Woody: You know, it's like, it's just an endless scroll of people describing all of the different ways they've died in sports.

196
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.090
Andrew Harshman: All the wacky Looney Tunes Tom Ford.

197
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.439
Scott Burger: Before… before we jump in….

198
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.300
Andrew Harshman: you said, Scott, that this game is secretly a pinball game?

199
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.230
Scott Burger: I mean, yeah, it feels….

200
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.139
Andrew Harshman: Are you all being your rag-dolling corpse, or…?

201
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:47.719
Scott Burger: Your health pool being your strokes. I think, like, before we jump into, like, an example run, I do want to touch real quick on, like, the intro and tutorial, because I get… I think that, like, this game does really well with, like, setting the stage, where, like, you boot up the game the first time, the graphics, I think, in this game are excellent.

202
00:21:47.720 --> 00:22:00.649
Scott Burger: Where, like, normally I'm really not a fan of, like, kind of cartoony-looking design like this, but I think the art here is really, really good, and it works really well for, like, the theme of the game being, like, an Indiana Jones simulator.

203
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:21.679
Scott Burger: Where, like, you boot up the game, and, you know, your spelunker, your Indiana Jones, non-copyright infringing character is walking through the desert, and comes to this big, big cave, you drop a rope down, and there's, like, a big door, but it's locked, oh no, and you're effectively forced to go through the tutorial sequence, which kind of sucks if you have your save lost.

204
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.839
Woody: Yeah, it's crazy, this game doesn't have Cloud Save on PC.

205
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:35.889
Scott Burger: Yeah, it's kind of wild. But, … I will say, like, jumping into this on my Steam Deck, I was like, ugh, I gotta go through the tutorial again. Well, fine, let's do it. And I remember, like.

206
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:47.350
Scott Burger: being pretty well educated, and, like, the, the little journal pops up, and it's the explorer, Yang, who has left you this journal with all of his tips of, like, oh, this, you know.

207
00:22:47.610 --> 00:23:07.510
Scott Burger: here's how to survive in the dungeon and everything, and you go through, like, basically an example, like, run of the mines. It's very easy, and it has all, like, these enormous billboards in the background that I think are very cute, of, like, stick figures jumping with the buttons and stuff, but there's also, like, very subtle.

208
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:27.120
Scott Burger: game mechanics sprinkled in there, like with, like a row of spikes and a gem behind it, and you're like, I'm not gonna jump on the spikes to get the gem. Clearly, that's a trap, but if you, like, fall off to the side, you can walk through the spikes to get the gem. It's not explicitly spelled out, but if it's one of those things that you just happen to stumble across, you're just like….

209
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.509
Andrew Harshman: Too, too subtle for some players.

210
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.160
Colin: Yeah, I didn't….

211
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:41.039
Andrew Harshman: And critically, this is all being presented, of course, in-game, you're playing it, and it is, of course, a platformer, a side-scrolling platformer for anyone who happens to not know what we're talking about.

212
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:52.230
Scott Burger: Yeah, but it teaches you stuff, like, here's how to use the whip to open boxes, here's how to, like, plant a bomb down instead of throwing it, here's how to, like, do running jumps and run over pits at full speed.

213
00:23:52.230 --> 00:24:09.859
Scott Burger: And then Yang's journal goes on to say, alright, you know, you're on your own adventure, like, go out and seek the gold, and then the key to the entrance of the mines blows open in this big blue explosion, and you start your first run into the mines!

214
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.700
Woody: And, yeah.

215
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:19.389
Andrew Harshman: And immediately ends, … Very quickly, you start with 4 health, and everything.

216
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:27.780
Andrew Harshman: In this, procedurally generated level is out to murderize you, including gravity, especially gravity.

217
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.859
Woody: And I would say, like, the most telling thing in this game, probably the thing that's, you know…

218
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:46.100
Woody: pushes people away immediately is the arrow traps, which are on the first level, and they're these, like, little gargoyle heads, and they… they're kind of hard to notice at first, because they are just blocks in the wall, and…

219
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:57.729
Woody: when you jump in front of them, like, even a fair distance away, they will shoot this high-speed crossbow bolt that just, like, pierces your character and deals you, I think, 3 damage?

220
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:08.010
Scott Burger: It's 2 damage, but it's like 50% of your starting health with one hit, and you're just… and, in theory, if, like, you bounce off of that and fall down a pit, there goes another health, and then….

221
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:15.779
Andrew Harshman: Or if you get shot, launched into an enemy, yeah, damage has a tendency to, combo in this game.

222
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.350
Woody: For sure.

223
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.310
Andrew Harshman: And … what's…

224
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:34.549
Andrew Harshman: Yes, I think you've, you've really touched on something important, Woody, here, the arrow traps, which are present all the way up until the fourth biome, off and on, if I'm not mistaken. They do show up in the fourth level.

225
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.160
Woody: level, you also get, magma pits with guys that jump out of the magma.

226
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:46.369
Andrew Harshman: Magma pits, and, and mummies, and … let's… let's not forget the…

227
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.080
Andrew Harshman: … strange blocks that will insta-give you.

228
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.489
Woody: Oh, yeah, someone walks to chase after you.

229
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.290
Scott Burger: Yeah. I guess, like….

230
00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:09.310
Andrew Harshman: With regards to the arrow traps, sorry, let's stick with the arrow traps for a moment. They are… so the tile that is used, this is, of course, a tile-based, you know, platforming game. The tile and the texture that's used for the arrow trap.

231
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:18.219
Andrew Harshman: is very similar to another tile, which is just a regular stone block. The difference being is there's sort of like an artistic rendition of, like.

232
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:26.620
Woody: That regular stone block, like, there's the brown, sort of, you know, normal landscape, but then there is these stone blocks

233
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:46.060
Woody: that will fall. Like, the brown blocks will stay in the air, and the stone blocks will fall, so many a time, I have gotten the Maddock, a tool that allows you to dig, and I have been digging my way horizontally through, and, you know, mostly it's harmless, and then you dig your way under a stone block, and you keep walking forward, and that just falls and crushes you.

234
00:26:46.060 --> 00:27:03.830
Andrew Harshman: One of the few times I laughed when I died in this game was when I got crushed by one of those blocks. But the point is that these arrow traps… I've been playing this game for 24 hours. Out of the two weeks we've been playing this game, I spent an entire day playing it. I am still…

235
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:14.010
Andrew Harshman: running into these arrow traps, because they are well camouflaged, and you have so… talk about cognitive load. This is, in some part, a memory game.

236
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.520
Woody: Sure.

237
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:31.869
Andrew Harshman: a very, difficult and, not at all lenient memory game. You need to remember, how does the arrow trap work? How do these different enemies behave? How do the large stone blocks work? What is the behavior of the

238
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.089
Andrew Harshman: Everything in the tru- in the level.

239
00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.859
Woody: to me, is what is interesting about this game, because there are so….

240
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.580
Andrew Harshman: Interesting! It's very difficult.

241
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.580
Woody: To, like, a retro aesthetic, like…

242
00:27:44.360 --> 00:28:02.829
Woody: there are so many games that are memory ga- like, you know, Punch-Out! is a memory game, because you can memorize the patterns. Here, Spelunky, it can't be a memorization game, because the things are randomized, so every… you have to stay… it's essentially a game…

243
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.780
Woody: that prevents you from resting on your laurels, and prevents you from playing lazily. You can't have played so many hours of Spelunky that you just, like.

244
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.230
Woody: cruise through unconsciously, because….

245
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.820
Scott Burger: Unless you're a speedrunner.

246
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.199
Woody: Well, sure, but even that…

247
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:29.930
Woody: It's, like, there are speedrunners of, you know, tons of games who can play those games with their eyes closed.

248
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:30.640
Scott Burger: Sure.

249
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:38.310
Woody: And, like, that's not a joke, like, they literally, like, there's footage of people just, you know, beating Mike Tyson with their eyes closed. ….

250
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.570
Scott Burger: Blindfolded Dark Souls, right?

251
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:44.649
Woody: Yes, you're never gonna find a speedrunner for Spelunky who can beat it with their eyes closed.

252
00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.879
Colin: But you can find a speedrunner who can beat it with the Donkey Kong bongo drums.

253
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.090
Woody: ….

254
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.450
Andrew Harshman: Now, it's funny that you mention that.

255
00:28:53.450 --> 00:29:01.310
Woody: What is cool about Spelunky Is that it is a game that no… as you keep playing it.

256
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:11.440
Woody: you just are forced to stay engaged the whole time. It has that level of tension, whereas if you want to play games in, like.

257
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:21.600
Woody: so many times, I will fall back on, like, a comfort game. Like, in some ways, like, Enter the Gungeon is a comfort game with me, another game that, you know, we've been on.

258
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.200
Woody: that I was on, because, like.

259
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:34.020
Woody: For the… even though, like, the locations of treasure chests and stuff are randomized, like, the game pretty much feels the same each time you play it. And, like.

260
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:45.320
Woody: I know how each enemy reacts and things like that, and it just feels way more forgiving than Spelunky, which is just, you know, if I don't pay attention for a little bit, I just get annihilated.

261
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.559
Woody: And so….

262
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.360
Andrew Harshman: Quite.

263
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:55.320
Woody: Yeah, I… I'm just… I'm very pro-Spelunky, but you certainly have to be in a certain mood for it, and like…

264
00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:06.229
Woody: To demonstrate that, I was playing this game a lot on my Steam Deck to prepare for this, and I kept dying. Like, which is classic, like, I have beaten this game, …

265
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:24.150
Woody: by going through Hell, which is, like, the alternate path… hard mode path. That was many years ago, and I'm like, oh yeah, I should be able to get Spelunky, no problem. And then I was playing on the Steam Deck, and I just kept dying in that first, those caves. And then I played on my PC, and I just beat it through the first run.

266
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.929
Woody: And I think that, like, part of that…

267
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:40.489
Woody: is that when I'm playing on my Steam Deck and I'm laying in bed, like, I just don't have that same sort of level of focus that I have sitting on an uncomfortable chair, like, looking at my laptop.

268
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.900
Woody: because… and especially because, like, Spelunky is such a vertically-oriented game.

269
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:52.119
Woody: And, like, the Steam Deck is naturally, like, a… big, wide, horizontal screen. …

270
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.560
Woody: But I just feel like that was demonstrative of, like.

271
00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:08.510
Woody: if you want to play Spelunky, like, you just have to pay attention. Like, you just kind of have to just be conscious of what is around you at all times, and not sort of get complacent.

272
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.629
Woody: And I think that what's…

273
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.949
Woody: I don't know, and obviously it's, like, difficulty is just a matter of… degrees. And so…

274
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.260
Woody: It… what is comfortable for someone might be off-putting for other people, and like…

275
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:30.030
Woody: I feel like Spelunky is pretty much the right difficulty, but…

276
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.989
Woody: That's not to say there's not.

277
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.370
Andrew Harshman: For… for who?

278
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:33.960
Woody: No.

279
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.730
Scott Burger: Woody.

280
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:39.749
Woody: I mean, for me, but that's the question of, like, if you…

281
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:47.459
Woody: I mean, what would this game be if you played it and beat it in the first run?

282
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.149
Woody: Like, I mean….

283
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.080
Andrew Harshman: Completely different game. Right.

284
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.250
Woody: What do you, Colin and Andrew, like, what do you guys want?

285
00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:04.590
Woody: from your time starting to play this game? Like, how many deaths is reasonable before you say, you know, screw this, I'm gonna go play something else?

286
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:11.230
Andrew Harshman: Well, I can tell you, because I just looked it up. I have 24 hours in this game, 260 deaths.

287
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.660
Woody: Sure.

288
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:27.169
Andrew Harshman: folks, which, I mean, was kind of surprising, but now that I've sat with that number for a little bit, it's not that surprising. I don't think I've reached that critical mass yet. I'm willing to keep at this game. I think the furthest I got was…

289
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:33.739
Andrew Harshman: I've been to Biome 4 a fair bit. I think the furthest I got was, like.

290
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.909
Andrew Harshman: Level 2, definitely, maybe level 3 of Biome 4. Yeah.

291
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.530
Woody: You're almost there. I mean….

292
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.350
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, thank you.

293
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.129
Colin: Andrew, are you having fun playing it?

294
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.099
Scott Burger: That's a great question. You weren't liking it.

295
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.710
Colin: very much when we started, and then….

296
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.669
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, you're still.

297
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:49.319
Colin: 24 hours.

298
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:58.590
Andrew Harshman: It has been just up and down, up and down, a wild roller coaster with this game, let me tell ya. But I tell you what, …

299
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.500
Andrew Harshman: Do… do… am I having fun? Do… do I, like this game? Do I hate this game?

300
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:12.190
Andrew Harshman: I'm not totally sure, but I can tell you someone's opinion who has been officially declared in this quote from my wife.

301
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:18.129
Woody: Quote, tell them your wife says she hates Spelunky. Never played it.

302
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.059
Andrew Harshman: But hates it based on how mad it makes you.

303
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.250
Andrew Harshman: Now… Hi!

304
00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.840
Andrew Harshman: This is a frustrating game, it could be a frustrating….

305
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.220
Colin: It's.

306
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.710
Andrew Harshman: Period.

307
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:30.340
Woody: I've done…

308
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:36.990
Woody: pretend that this is not a frustrating game. You would have to be trolling to claim Spelunky is not frustrating.

309
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:45.650
Andrew Harshman: Yes, I tend to agree. So, yeah, to be clear, you know, I haven't destroyed anything.

310
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.349
Andrew Harshman: I haven't gone off the handle, but I have been cursing up a storm.

311
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:59.559
Andrew Harshman: And, I have been… Saying some not-nice things, about the game.

312
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:07.269
Andrew Harshman: maybe not directly to the designers, but the game itself. At times, it has felt like this game is…

313
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.899
Andrew Harshman: Out to get me.

314
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.670
Woody: Yeah.

315
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.119
Andrew Harshman: I mean.

316
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.099
Woody: It is.

317
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.549
Andrew Harshman: I… that is…

318
00:34:13.789 --> 00:34:23.709
Andrew Harshman: Thank you. It's good to hear that I'm not the only one who feels that way at times. I have another quote from my wife here that I just want to toss in real quick. …

319
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.199
Andrew Harshman: Ahem!

320
00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.859
Andrew Harshman: Wow, that IS a terrible whip!

321
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:35.700
Andrew Harshman: I was describing to her how god-awful the starting weapon is in this game.

322
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.759
Andrew Harshman: And, now, listeners, imagine, if you will, the Castlevania Whip.

323
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:50.229
Andrew Harshman: With all of its weird timing, and sort of odd… hit registration.

324
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:59.950
Andrew Harshman: reduce the range to, oh, I don't know, maybe… what? The length of an extended index finger?

325
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:10.429
Andrew Harshman: … the length of, I don't know, a yardstick? Not even a yardstick! It is… this is… a piss-poor starting weapon.

326
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.090
Woody: Sure.

327
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:24.730
Andrew Harshman: And I think it is representative of a number of piss-poor things that this game gives you. Piss-poor amount of bombs, piss-poor amount of ropes, piss-poor amount of health.

328
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:25.680
Woody: Sure.

329
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.060
Andrew Harshman: If any of these knobs were just adjusted just up a little bit, the game would be so much easier.

330
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.810
Scott Burger: I feel like I….

331
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.119
Andrew Harshman: This was all very intentional design.

332
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.810
Scott Burger: Yeah.

333
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.740
Andrew Harshman: But, like.

334
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:46.409
Andrew Harshman: Golly, in the tutorial, I thought, well, great, I'm just gonna be, like, bombing and roping my way through these levels, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna be awesome. Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not. You gotta work for

335
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.319
Andrew Harshman: You gotta work for them ropes. You gotta work for those items.

336
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.930
Woody: To have, like, just in the option menu, the ability to just modify

337
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.710
Woody: You know, starting rope, starting bomb, starting health, like….

338
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.390
Colin: Would that have given you a better way to explore the mechanics of the game?

339
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.640
Colin: I will agree with Andrew that I hate the whip, I hate how… Slow it is.

340
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640
Woody: Yeah, it sucks.

341
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.920
Colin: Whip sucks, and it feels bad to use it.

342
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.170
Scott Burger: But if the whip.

343
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:31.189
Colin: was just a slight bit faster. I don't… the range, I can deal with the range being low, but the number of times in the, you know, 2 hours that I played this game that I just, like, ran into an enemy because I expected the whip to have hit them by the time I got to them is, like, pretty high.

344
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:36.400
Woody: It's also, this game has a lot of flying enemies, like, the bats are.

345
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.150
Colin: Yeah, yeah.

346
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:41.829
Woody: pretty tough, and the whip has essentially no upward arc to it, and so….

347
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.160
Andrew Harshman: Isn't.

348
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:42.639
Woody: I used to get.

349
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.650
Andrew Harshman: Castlevania.

350
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:53.530
Woody: My advice to you regarding that is don't use the whip. Like, just… it's kind of a last resort thing, …

351
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.060
Woody: I, for the moment.

352
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.070
Andrew Harshman: Dude, you have to get… you have to get another weapon, though.

353
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.480
Woody: You just jump on dudes. Right, you gotta, you got a, you got a Super Mario Bros. Or commercially.

354
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.400
Woody: Or….

355
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.010
Colin: Maybe that's… maybe that was the thing that I was missing, that….

356
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:14.439
Woody: Yeah, I would definitely recommend jumping on dudes, and more… another piece of advice is, like, you can also ignore dudes. Like, this game.

357
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.030
Andrew Harshman: Very true.

358
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:21.950
Woody: Nice balance of, … Incentivizing you to explore a little bit?

359
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.329
Woody: But, like, the more bogged down you get in exploring, …

360
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:34.999
Woody: You're, you're… you still risk triggering more traps, And so, I usually have…

361
00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:51.020
Woody: pretty successful runs just kind of, like, heading for the exit ASAP. And, like, the levels aren't that big in this game. I… I… I want to go back a little bit, because Colin very thoughtfully asked a question about the progression of this game, and then we….

362
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.419
Andrew Harshman: Of course! Yes, good memory.

363
00:37:53.570 --> 00:38:02.340
Woody: So Scott, you know, walked us through the tutorial, and from a gameplay perspective, Colin, like, what you saw in the first biome…

364
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:14.630
Woody: is the game. Like, there is not some kind of, like, big switch in the second and third biome where, like, mechanically, they give you a mech suit, and then you just start blasting missiles at everything.

365
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:19.149
Scott Burger: comes up RPG, and then a card game at the very end, and….

366
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:31.730
Woody: Exactly, it's kind of the level feel changes a little bit, like the second, whorl biome, which I think is maybe the hardest biome, is a jungle, and there are many more traps.

367
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.620
Andrew Harshman: We need to talk about that later, yeah, but do continue.

368
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.859
Woody: Monsters, you know, monsters hanging around, like, monkeys jump on you.

369
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.920
Scott Burger: man-eating piranha.

370
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:56.310
Woody: Mine Eating Piranhas, that has a slightly more horizontal feel, but not much, and then there's, you know, dudes with boomerangs who chuck at you. All of these game, all of these biomes have, like, secret levels that you can get to.

371
00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:03.449
Woody: this game has a pretty good amount of… or I think, a healthy, well-balanced amount of, like, secret content.

372
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:20.819
Woody: But, like, the core path through the game is not very long. The third level is the Yeti Caves, which is probably the most… oh, there goes Colin. He… he was just like, no more of this! I'm sick of you talking about Spelunky. ….

373
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.129
Scott Burger: Ice caves, you mean?

374
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.469
Woody: Yeah, well, I mean, Yetis live in the ice cave.

375
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.240
Andrew Harshman: Hey kids, I'm outta here!

376
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:36.780
Scott Burger: Yeti caves, specifically, are, like, one of the offshoot branches, where… or I guess, like, is it… that's one of the level feelings, right? Where, like, you have… Oh, sure. …like, the actual Yetis in… or, like, the Yeti King, I guess, specifically.

377
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:52.080
Woody: Yeah, that's the Yeti. All the ice levels have Yetis in them, but … there's this thing called level feelings, where you're at the start of the level. Like, the most common one you get is, like, I can't see a thing in here, and then the level's dark, which I also think is kind of BS.

378
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.590
Andrew Harshman: Oh, boy.

379
00:39:52.590 --> 00:40:01.950
Woody: I am not a big fan of that, because even if you survive those levels, like, they're just not that fun. It's not that fun to run around without being able to see anything that's going on.

380
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.910
Scott Burger: Check it out.

381
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:09.140
Andrew Harshman: The thing with the dark levels, the lights-out levels, is that it gives you a torch.

382
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.959
Andrew Harshman: And the torch gives you a view radius that is…

383
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.459
Andrew Harshman: I don't know, approximately half the screen, but not the whole screen.

384
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.609
Woody: It's quite limited.

385
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:26.589
Andrew Harshman: It is extremely limited. If you drop the torch, then it is, like, half of that, and you're… it's basically a death sentence.

386
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.650
Woody: And you only have one item carry.

387
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:42.620
Andrew Harshman: Precisely! Precisely! I had a very promising run happening, my final run leading up to this recording. I started from the very beginning, and I was working my way through. I got to the first level of the temple. I had a shotgun.

388
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:53.639
Andrew Harshman: I had bombs. I had equipment, I was loaded for bear, and the RNG drops me into temple level 1. Hey, it's awfully dark in here, turn down the lights!

389
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.280
Andrew Harshman: Death sentence.

390
00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:08.919
Andrew Harshman: Absolutely, I didn't stand a chance. Anyway, yeah, so there's… and I mean, that's… that is an example. I mean, the… the lights being out and the torch mechanics, while challenging, is…

391
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:19.760
Andrew Harshman: interesting, and this game does a lot of cool stuff, with, you know, taking its core mechanics and adding on different modifiers and changes and… and making each run feel…

392
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:26.589
Andrew Harshman: unique, which, which is, is great, but sometimes, to your detriment.

393
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:41.310
Scott Burger: So there's a lot of, like, interlocking pieces with how… how little there is here, too, compared to, like, we're so spoiled for games like Noita or Binding of Isaac that's, like, now with over 5 million items or something. And this game has, like, I don't know, 30? Question mark?

394
00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:58.649
Scott Burger: But, like, the ice caves, notably, have, like, I think, like, these very well-artistically designed, like, ice blocks that, shocker, when you walk on them, like, you slide a little bit. But, if you have the spike boots that you can buy from a shopkeep.

395
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:17.959
Scott Burger: that do more damage when you Mario jump on dudes' heads, those will give you grip on the ice blocks to, like, walk around in. And maybe it's a thing that, like, we just kind of take for granted in every road game nowadays, but, like, it feels like basically everything in the game has some other way of interacting with all the other elements like that, which feels….

396
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:33.800
Woody: just all interacts in a super intuitive way. Like, this is what I've been thinking… like, this is the thing that I enjoy the most about game design, and, like, another game that I've talked about on this podcast is, Into the Breach, which I think is a game that really does this too.

397
00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:51.840
Woody: is where games are uniform in their mechanics, and everything has this level of intuitiveness. Like, so, like, if you think about the game of… I don't know, if you think about football, like, American football is an example,

398
00:42:52.170 --> 00:43:09.669
Woody: it's like, someone comes up with a sport, it's like, okay, what's the idea of this sport? Well, you have to get, you know, you have to advance the football from one side of the field to the other, and the other team's trying to stop you. And you say, okay, great, that's a simple premise, no problem. We'll do that. And they're like, wait a second, we have to, like, try and figure out ways to make this fair.

399
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:14.460
Woody: And it's like, you can't tackle a guy unless he has the ball. And you can't… but, like…

400
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:20.370
Woody: You have to line up in a certain way, because it's like, there's all these sort of extra things.

401
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.519
Scott Burger: And then you have ineligible downfield receivers of the offensive line, causing kick-off.

402
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.190
Colin: ball.

403
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:38.689
Woody: Yeah, sometimes you can kick, but not always, and it's like… Sometimes you can throw it forward, but not always. And it's like all of these ideas of you've started with this really simple premise, but you have to keep adding junk.

404
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:57.079
Woody: to try and make it a fair and exciting game. And, like, what I love about Spelunky is they're like, you go into a cave, and there's things you can buy, and there's treasure you can get, and, like, that's it. Like, this game doesn't feel like it has elements to it.

405
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.570
Woody: That exists solely to balance the game.

406
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:09.059
Scott Burger: Soccer's too elegant. This is, like, the rugby of games, where, like, you're just being pummeled constantly, like, you're falling down on the ground, there's all sorts of arms and.

407
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:09.670
Woody: Yeah.

408
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:13.259
Scott Burger: Grabbing in places… Rugby's got a ton of rules, like, this….

409
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.290
Woody: Like, this to me is just like….

410
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.710
Andrew Harshman: Alright, this is like, this is like a back alley, this is street rugby. Yeah, yeah.

411
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:34.720
Woody: This is underground rugby. Everything here seems to work in such an intuitive way, like, the shopkeeper is selling stuff. You can, you know, steal from the shopkeeper, but that is gonna tick him off.

412
00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:45.770
Andrew Harshman: Alright, we gotta talk about the shopkeeper some more. Sure. Check it out. This is the most vindictive, shopkeep ever. In Enter the Gungeon, you know.

413
00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:58.770
Andrew Harshman: even, like, from a character design perspective, these dudes look similar. They've got facial hair, they're a little portly, they get a little bit angry if you start shooting up the place, or if you start acting a fool. This shopkeep…

414
00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:07.819
Andrew Harshman: goes ballistic. And if any damage is dealt to him by any source in the level, he is aggroed to you, and forevermore!

415
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.060
Scott Burger: shop, or his shop, even.

416
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.359
Woody: Yeah, well, he tells all his shopkeep friends, so even.

417
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.739
Andrew Harshman: He tells all of his clones, all of the T1000.

418
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.180
Scott Burger: Those clones! And….

419
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.619
Andrew Harshman: He's got a shotgun, and he absolutely will not stop until you are dead.

420
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.650
Andrew Harshman: Or he falls on a spike trap, and you can pick up his stuff.

421
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:34.140
Woody: All of the clones will then hang out at the exit for the next 5 or so levels, ….

422
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.500
Andrew Harshman: It's… ….

423
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.110
Woody: It's pretty wild. I mean, it's a real….

424
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.170
Colin: Risk-reward versus situation. Every so often….

425
00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:42.090
Andrew Harshman: The word is right.

426
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:45.220
Colin: I never defeated the shopkeep. If you do….

427
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.720
Andrew Harshman: have.

428
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:53.100
Colin: If you… if you have defeated him in his multiple iterations, do you just get the shop… do they… does the shop still generate the next levels, yeah?

429
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.979
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, except that he's supposed to get their stuff.

430
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.169
Woody: to kill you.

431
00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:07.789
Woody: infinite shopkeeps, like Andrew said, they're clones, so the shops will generate in the next level, but as soon as you get next to it, that shopkeeper will just aggro you immediately, because you killed his original.

432
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:25.760
Scott Burger: And when we were talking about a pinball game before, this is, like, like, Sonic spinball levels of, like, sickening, bouncing all around the level at, like, comically turbo speed. They have… they have wall hacks, they have aimbots, they have 10 HP, where I was….

433
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.650
Andrew Harshman: N?

434
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:43.490
Scott Burger: They have 10 HP, but, like, again, they are… they're perfectly susceptible to the same things you are, including spike traps, web traps, bombs, like, freeze rays, telefragging, even, …

435
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:49.759
Scott Burger: There is, yeah, like, despite how, like, wildly overpowered they are, there's also, like, a way.

436
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:56.920
Andrew Harshman: It should be noted that this is… this is another… another point for Spelunky as a true roguelike, because the…

437
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:04.380
Andrew Harshman: creatures and the enemies, the NPCs in the game, operate more or less with the same rules as the player character.

438
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.060
Woody: Yeah.

439
00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:15.160
Scott Burger: Yep. And, like, notably, there is a way to de-aggro them that's basically impossible for, like, to exit the level without being seen by one. I mean, good luck. Like, Metal Gear Solid style, but….

440
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.769
Woody: Yeah, except they hang out at the exit, so, like, that is really, really hard.

441
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:33.429
Scott Burger: if there was, like, an item, I don't know, like, one of the Egyptian artifact items that we'll get to in a minute, like, if there was one of those that, like, you could activate to go invisible for 2 seconds, like, that could be a way to, like, play with that system a little. But I think it's probably fine, because, like.

442
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:49.779
Andrew Harshman: Oh, it's fine, it's just… it's… it's… very inter… it's something that I've not seen in a game before, like, a shopkeep, a network of shopkeeps that are so vindictive. In Enter the Gungeon, he just closes the shop. He says, well, fine, you can't buy stuff.

443
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.089
Andrew Harshman: He doesn't go medieval on your ass.

444
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.860
Scott Burger: For the rest of the game.

445
00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:01.850
Andrew Harshman: For the rest of the… yeah, for all time, unless you do that one specific thing you mentioned. That's interesting, Scott.

446
00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:08.810
Scott Burger: as, like, deadly as, like, the, the Anubis god, or something, just about.

447
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:16.340
Andrew Harshman: And check it out, if you, like, blow something up in a level, or you set off, like, a big giant boulder trap, which could potentially, hey, grow the shopkeep.

448
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:16.660
Woody: Yeah.

449
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.880
Andrew Harshman: It is the worst feeling in the world.

450
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.760
Scott Burger: Active.

451
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.359
Andrew Harshman: one of those, and then here, Aggro music for the shopkeep.

452
00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:33.630
Andrew Harshman: Which, all the music's great, but, oh man, that is… that is not a.

453
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.319
Scott Burger: You're gonna be hearing that music a lot.

454
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.499
Andrew Harshman: Quite possibly, quite possibly.

455
00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.120
Woody: Yeah, I guess in some ways, like, it's kind of odd that my general advice for this game is, like.

456
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:56.419
Woody: try not to engage with all… like, if you want to get far, like, don't overly engage with those systems. Like, if you see a shopkeep and he's selling, like, one item you want, go ahead and buy it.

457
00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:05.429
Woody: If you see the thing that triggers a giant boulder and it's right by the exit, go ahead and take it and get out of there. But, like, if it is not, then…

458
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:10.280
Woody: Just ignore it, because it's gonna trigger a bunch of bad things that happen.

459
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.890
Andrew Harshman: Oh, go ahead, sorry.

460
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:16.030
Woody: No, I was just, I mean, I just think that, like, at its core.

461
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.730
Woody: This game just has, like, an incredible, sort of, Cleanness to it.

462
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.729
Woody: Like, just this sense of, like.

463
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.470
Woody: Everything that is in this game is in their…

464
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.769
Woody: for a reason, and, like, makes the game more fun. There is not…

465
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.289
Woody: There is not something that, like.

466
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:42.000
Woody: comes up, and I'm like, oh, I can't believe that. Like, an item, I guess specifically an item.

467
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.880
Scott Burger: Crush traps.

468
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:48.979
Woody: Yeah, well, some… there's plenty of traps and stuff that do not make the game more fun.

469
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:56.160
Woody: But it… yeah, like Andrew said, there's… there's a real feeling of, like, Intentional design.

470
00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:04.309
Woody: There's not a feeling of, like, oh crap, we have to come up with a hundred more items for this game, everyone get to the drawing board and just, like, think of stuff.

471
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:04.720
Scott Burger: Yeah.

472
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.089
Woody: It's like, what fits into this system? And to me, like…

473
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:18.659
Woody: that comes back to my original premise of, like, Spelunky is a definitive video game, because it is just sort of platforming

474
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:31.280
Woody: at its most basic. Like, even Super Mario Bros, it's like, oh, you can go into this pipe, but you can't go into these pipes, and it's like, well, why can I go into that pipe? It's like, I don't know, you just can. Like, Spelunky…

475
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.380
Woody: Hardly has any of that kind of stuff.

476
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:45.660
Scott Burger: Yeah. So, continuing with our standard run, you know, you go through the mines, you go through the jungle, you go through the caves, you get to the temple, the final level, and you're jumping….

477
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:55.309
Andrew Harshman: evil obsidian Egyptian, death temple of sorts. Yeah, I mean, insofar as it's filled with death traps.

478
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:59.820
Scott Burger: Yeah, it's got your standard, ancient Egyptian things like, mummies, ….

479
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.409
Woody: Let your bees at you.

480
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:07.389
Scott Burger: Bees! Croc, Croc Men, Magma Men, and Anubis, of course.

481
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.139
Andrew Harshman: Who has a projectile.

482
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:18.369
Andrew Harshman: That is very slow, but it goes through walls, I believe it follows you around.

483
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:19.190
Woody: Definitely follows you.

484
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:23.790
Andrew Harshman: And it deals 5 damage, which is almost assuredly an insta-kill.

485
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:24.360
Woody: Yep.

486
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:26.119
Woody: It's very unreasonable.

487
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.359
Andrew Harshman: My goodness!

488
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:40.500
Scott Burger: If you have sticky bombs, if you have a pitcher's mitt, you can sit all the way on the other side of the screen, maybe even off-screen, and just huck sticky bombs at Anubis from almost off-screen, and just nuke him.

489
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.950
Andrew Harshman: To be clear, Dickie?

490
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:52.929
Woody: The bombs are very clutch to get a good run, and this game is luckily fairly generous with the big spider enemy, and, like, usually I'm very anti-big spider enemies in games, because ick.

491
00:51:53.050 --> 00:52:08.249
Woody: But, like, this… this big spider, like, he sits… as long as you don't run under him, you don't trigger his aggro, and he sits right above two spider webs that will catch your bombs. So you just chuck a bomb in there, and it blows him up, and then you can get his, sticky webbing, which is super sweet.

492
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:17.220
Scott Burger: And so, to Andrew's point, I think that there are, like, elements that feel, like, in a silo, feel, like, wildly overpowered and imbalanced.

493
00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:17.870
Andrew Harshman: But….

494
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:25.620
Scott Burger: But I think the game is expecting you, the player, to become wildly overpowered and imbalanced to balance out that aspect.

495
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.559
Andrew Harshman: isn't that, like, the heart of a road? Like, that's… that's like FTL, right?

496
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.109
Scott Burger: Yeah, that's like a million times.

497
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:46.700
Woody: the end of FTL is unbelievably overpowered. Yeah. But, like, the hope is by that time, you have accrued so much kit that you can take it on, and, like, that is what I like. I mean, this is something I really like about Spelunky, is…

498
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:51.339
Woody: It combines this idea, like, the joy of accruing loot.

499
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:55.400
Woody: That… and, like, feeling very powerful in a roguelike.

500
00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.490
Woody: With a sort of, just, like, bare-bones…

501
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.839
Woody: You feel like you're good at video games type of vibe.

502
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.180
Scott Burger: Basically.

503
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:15.550
Woody: But yeah, your standard run continues through the temple, you beat Anubis, maybe, or you smartly run past him. What's funny is, if you kill Anubis, speaking of things playing by the same rules, you can pick up his staff.

504
00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:34.050
Woody: and then you're like, awesome! I can shoot, like, psychic beams at enemies, and it follows them. Except it goes super slow, and you shoot one out in front of you, and then you just run forward, and you run into it, and it kills you. Like, even your own… the own gun that you shoot will still kill you. So it is very much a worthless weapon, even though it is cool that it's there.

505
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:35.330
Colin: Anubis chase you?

506
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.110
Woody: Very slowly.

507
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:42.399
Scott Burger: Okay. It's easy enough to run away from his little purple circle attacks that, like….

508
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.599
Colin: I guess the better question is, you can't make Anubis run into his own bullet, though, right?

509
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.560
Woody: No, you can't.

510
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:46.880
Scott Burger: No.

511
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.990
Woody: No, that would have been cool.

512
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.690
Colin: What if you, like, circle back around him in the.

513
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:53.630
Woody: It does not affect him, and I think you've brought up a good.

514
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.679
Andrew Harshman: And like, you know, yeah, you can run….

515
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.430
Woody: this game.

516
00:53:56.430 --> 00:54:13.290
Andrew Harshman: You can run past him, you can blow him up, you can get… you can try to go around him, but I mean, sometimes you've gotten this far in the run, and maybe you're running low on resources, and it's like, things start compounding. It's like, well, Anubis in isolation? Manageable. Anubis…

517
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:18.790
Andrew Harshman: in a room full of traps, Anubis in a room with some other enemies, ….

518
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:27.520
Woody: Isn't that just, like… I mean, you guys have a roguelike podcast, you've done 75 episodes of it, like, isn't the idea of, like…

519
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:33.759
Woody: running low on stuff and, like, RNG dealing you dumb bullshit, like, isn't that, like….

520
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:39.769
Andrew Harshman: Oh, no, no, no, that's where the drama comes in. You're right. You're absolutely correct. I'm not trying to say that Anubis is…

521
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:57.909
Andrew Harshman: … unfair, per se? Just… just… I'm just trying to highlight, like, yo, by the time you get to the end of this game, you are feeling the heat. Yes. Like, you thought everything was trying to kill you in the mines? That ain't nothing. That's kids' play. Welcome to the temple of your demise. What happens after the temple?

522
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:10.079
Woody: The temple is very much like, when I get to the temple, I am just like, I'm booking it for the exit. I don't care what else is around here, like, I'm just getting out of here. And the temple's the last world, so world 4-4… well, okay.

523
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:33.749
Woody: The temple is the last world in a standard run. Right. You can go through this intricate series of, like, getting a special item in the mines, and then finding the secret black market, and buying a really expensive item, and then doing a special interaction in the ice caves, and then you go to, like, the Lost City of Gold, and then you go to hell, and then you beat the real secret boss, and, like, it's a ton of effort, and, like, I did it once, and it was really cool, but, like.

524
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.310
Woody: I need to do it again.

525
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.120
Scott Burger: Oh.

526
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:48.400
Woody: But you get to the last boss in the temple, and this last boss is actually probably the thing I have the most problem with in Spelunky. Oh. He is Olmec.

527
00:55:48.720 --> 00:56:04.439
Woody: And he is a, big head. Have you ever seen the episode of The Simpsons Blood Feud, where, Bart donates blood to Mr. Burns, and then Mr. Burns, finally rewards him with a big, like, a big Mayan head?

528
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:06.050
Andrew Harshman: ….

529
00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:09.459
Scott Burger: I was thinking either that or, or Olmec from Legends of the Hidden Temple.

530
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.349
Andrew Harshman: Oh, they're… There we go, yeah.

531
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.500
Scott Burger: Yeah, he's like a big, like.

532
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.240
Colin: I was thinking Stonehead.

533
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.019
Woody: Yeah, he's a big stone head.

534
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.460
Scott Burger: Well, Gold Head, I guess. Gold!

535
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:21.910
Andrew Harshman: Okay.

536
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:38.990
Scott Burger: And you walk into Olmec's lair, and he's being worshipped by these cavemen, and then he goes bananas, like all giant gold heads do, and starts, like, crushing them. And then, like, he just starts moving around this arena, crushing the arena, and destroying it. And crucially, below this arena is a lava pit.

537
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.360
Woody: Yeah.

538
00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.490
Scott Burger: So, you aren't….

539
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.900
Andrew Harshman: Cool.

540
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:47.240
Scott Burger: You're running out of space, to… to, you know… and none of your bombs aren't gonna do anything.

541
00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:53.020
Andrew Harshman: Your bombs don't hurt Olmec, but you can use them to blow out the ground under. Yeah.

542
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:53.860
Woody: Yeah, sounds like….

543
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:58.940
Andrew Harshman: It's sort of a, Super Mario Bros. 3 Bowser fight type situation.

544
00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:04.389
Scott Burger: Yes. And I forget if, like, if there's any indication

545
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:14.990
Scott Burger: where… or yeah, so there's a standard exit to this level, which is just on the other side of the level, same side that you came in on, kind of, or the same elevation, I guess.

546
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:21.649
Scott Burger: Olmec, like, digs his own grave, literally falls into the lava, and you're like, oh, hooray, the exit's open, you come in, and you're….

547
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:22.000
Andrew Harshman: Ray.

548
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.229
Scott Burger: You know, you, you get all the gold, and then you, you leave the, the, the temple, or no, it's, ….

549
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:40.879
Andrew Harshman: You loot all the valuable artifacts, and you take them across the world to be put on display in an act of terror and colonialism, the likes of which no one has ever seen in such a cute sprite.

550
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:55.370
Woody: And then it gives you a cute thumbs up at the end. No, and that's right, and that's, that is the full game, that is the… that is a complete run of Spelunky, and, a run of Spelunky is pretty fast, like, ….

551
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:56.879
Scott Burger: In theory, you could beat it in, like….

552
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.359
Colin: 10 minutes.

553
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:11.789
Woody: yeah, 20, 30 minutes, should be fine, which I appreciate, being as there is so much stuff that can kind of punt your run, and so, like, the level of frustration that would be a part of it if you had a 40-minute run.

554
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:12.320
Andrew Harshman: the night.

555
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:12.800
Woody: some….

556
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.220
Andrew Harshman: Oh, great.

557
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:13.950
Woody: random spike traps.

558
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.240
Andrew Harshman: Right.

559
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:29.400
Woody: Yeah, I'm not crazy about Olmec, because all he does is he kind of has this upper arc to the left, and then when you get under him, he crashes down, or he has this upper arc to the right, where if you're under him to the right, he crashes down. And so.

560
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.589
Andrew Harshman: Presumably killing you in one hit.

561
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:40.119
Woody: Yes, oh yeah. That's the thing that's funny, is you can rescue maidens and or pugs and or, sexy Chippendale dancers, depending on your setting.

562
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:40.690
Andrew Harshman: Yes.

563
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.299
Andrew Harshman: Three, damsel types in this game.

564
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:52.269
Woody: And they, when you bring them… when you bring them to the exit, they, give you a kiss, which refills your health, one, but then by the time.

565
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.510
Andrew Harshman: your health. Gives you, gives you one health.

566
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:56.830
Woody: One health, yeah, you're right, it gives you one health.

567
00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:04.380
Andrew Harshman: No, no, you said a great… I just wanted to be clear, like, one health. And that is almost your only opportunity to heal.

568
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:17.720
Woody: But then, what is funny is by the time you get, really, to, like, the second world, the vast majority of stuff just kills you in one hit, because there's spikes, or the Yeti caves, you're just gonna fall down the pit, or the temple…

569
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:24.619
Woody: Yeah, there's just tons of stuff. But, like, Olmec is this weird sort of balance of being simultaneously

570
00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:30.060
Woody: Boring, and kind of feeling bad, because, like.

571
00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:41.629
Woody: I think he's hard. There's a lot of ways to mess up Olmec, like, cause if you run out of bombs, you can get… dig yourself a pit, and be stuck, and just… get crushed. ….

572
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:57.300
Scott Burger: unlike any other of the mini-bosses that you encounter. Right. It's not like a giant spider, it's not a beehive, it's not Anubis. It's not a shopkeep terminator. Right. No, it is just… it would be funny if there was a shopkeep on this level.

573
00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:12.249
Woody: would be kind of cool. Yeah, well, so many of the bosses in this game, it's basically, like, the best way to beat them is get jetpack, get shotgun, and just, like, go to town. Whereas none of those weapons work on Olmec, which I think is smart, except…

574
01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:17.670
Woody: pretty much every time you die on Olmec, it feels bad. Like, not…

575
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:34.420
Woody: because dying in this game doesn't always feel bad, but you just naturally feel dumb. Because he has, like, the most obvious pattern in the world, and you're just like, well, I just screwed up, and, like, you never beat him and feel cool. You know what I mean? You can never do, like, some sweet play that, like.

576
01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:48.050
Woody: brought, you know, like, dodged something awesome, or… I don't know, he just… it feels kind of anticlimactic, and like, I know this game has another route that is a lot, you know, even more intense, but…

577
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.969
Woody: I don't know, I, I, I don't, I don't….

578
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:50.740
Andrew Harshman: This is a stupid.

579
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:54.050
Woody: where I don't have a better idea, so….

580
01:00:54.050 --> 01:01:05.549
Andrew Harshman: That was gonna be my question. I feel like… I was so worried that… well, as it turns out, this was a con… this was a silly worry of mine. I'm like, oh, I'm so concerned that I'm gonna… I'm gonna beat this game.

581
01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:16.159
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, joke's on me. And the ending is going to be anticlimactic. I was imagining just going through the final door and it being like, congratulations! You're in the treasure room!

582
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:17.709
Andrew Harshman: the end. I mean, that….

583
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:34.119
Woody: kind of is the ending. Well, I mean, there is the boss, there is Olmec the boss, which can really be actually quite climactic the first time, because you… it's very stressful, because you have gotten this far, and you're like, oh, I have made it to Olmec, I don't want to mess up and just get crushed randomly.

584
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.840
Andrew Harshman: I don't want to get domed by this giant dome.

585
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.099
Andrew Harshman: Right, so, so, are you suggesting… it would be better if this was a better designed boss.

586
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:49.609
Woody: Yes, I am a proponent of there being some last boss, or something like that. I just would like…

587
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:53.169
Woody: Some boss that you felt like… Had… because the bottom.

588
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.359
Andrew Harshman: Doesn't feel good to win.

589
01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.499
Woody: And he also basically is the same every time you fight him, because, like, no matter what equipment you have.

590
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.309
Woody: Like, most of it isn't gonna be that relevant, except for the jetpack, which is always relevant.

591
01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:22.079
Scott Burger: Yeah, and I feel like it's so different from how you play the rest of the game that it sort of feels out of place, but it almost… in a way, it kind of feels like a relief of, like, the temple, like, the entire stage of the temple feels like the final boss fight.

592
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:41.989
Scott Burger: You have the arrow traps from Biome 1, you have the horizontal spike tiki traps from Biome 2, you have, … I forget if there's anything from Biome 3 in there, but, like, it feels like there… it's like the confluence of all of these other things that you've seen in the game, and now it's like, alright, you've seen it before.

593
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:46.800
Scott Burger: put it all into practice. This is, this is the run, like, this is the grading assignment here.

594
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.099
Woody: 3 is kind of like a weird, sort of.

595
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:54.270
Woody: respite. Like, I find level 3 to be significantly easier than Level 2.

596
01:02:54.270 --> 01:03:01.780
Andrew Harshman: Exactly! Yes, thank you, we're getting back to this topic, and Scott was the first to point this out to me, that Biome 3, …

597
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.670
Andrew Harshman: It's pretty chill. Much easier. Much easier.

598
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:05.040
Woody: What's time?

599
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:05.740
Andrew Harshman: Of course.

600
01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.120
Woody: It's chill.

601
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.789
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, it's gotta be. It's on brand. Why… why did they do that?

602
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:20.690
Scott Burger: I think that's a… that's a hallmark of a lot of Derek Yu games, where, like, the first level is, like, setting your expectation, the second level is, like, alright, I'm just gonna punch you as hard as I can.

603
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:32.440
Scott Burger: It is a dick-punching exercise. And then the third level's like, alright, I've punched you in the dick a whole bunch, let's have a smoke break for just a quick second before we get back into even heavier dick-punching.

604
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:49.660
Woody: Maybe it's this… maybe it's the idea that, like, he knows that after you've fought your way through the jungle, like, you're gonna be, like, so on edge that if you got to another, like, equally hard level, most people would just be like, you know what, forget it. I'm done with this. But, like, a lot of times…

605
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.560
Woody: You will beat the jungle for the first time, and then you will make it through, like, most of the ice caves, if not all of them, and you'll be like, oh, I can, like, I can do this! The end is in sight.

606
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.010
Scott Burger: Yeah, if the temple was immediately after the jungle, this game would be….

607
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.530
Andrew Harshman: Boy.

608
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:07.849
Scott Burger: a lot… a lot less well received, I feel like.

609
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:08.670
Andrew Harshman: That's….

610
01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:10.050
Woody: That's probably true.

611
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:16.289
Colin: What if it were swapped? What if it was… first level ICE… Then Jungle, then temple.

612
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:16.729
Woody: Well, I think.

613
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:17.680
Colin: Is that what you mean?

614
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.120
Woody: I think story-wise, like, you can't start with the ice caves, just in terms of, like, that is a weird… that would be a weird place to start.

615
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.050
Scott Burger: No, I think, like, Mines, Ice Caves, Jungle Temple.

616
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.390
Woody: Yeah, I think that would work fine.

617
01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.769
Scott Burger: Hmm. ….

618
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.690
Woody: I don't know, the ice caves….

619
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:43.069
Colin: I guess a better question would be, is ice caves actually easier, or is it that you have more stuff by the time you're in ice caves? Like, are they… are they literally the same difficulty, but you're just further in the game?

620
01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.750
Scott Burger: Ice Caves is significantly easier than the jungle.

621
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:57.900
Woody: But I do think Ice Caves does reward you a lot for being well-equipped, because there are a lot of scenarios where you have to take big jumps, so, like, having a cape or a jetpack or lots of ropes is super helpful.

622
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:58.860
Andrew Harshman: Indeed.

623
01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:05.669
Woody: Colin has been sitting stoically like an Olmec head for a while here, so I… I just want to ask…

624
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.780
Woody: like…

625
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:16.479
Woody: So, was your main bounce on this game, Colin, is that it is just kind of hard and unforgiving, or do you find, like, the mechanics of this to just be kind of uninteresting?

626
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:22.400
Colin: A little bit of both. I'm… I'm generally not…

627
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.740
Colin: I don't like hard games that are hard just for being hard.

628
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.440
Andrew Harshman: Do you like platformers.

629
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:35.419
Colin: I'm indifferent… I do not have strong feelings one way or another for platformers. Okay. Like, I….

630
01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.840
Andrew Harshman: You like Indiana Jones?

631
01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:38.700
Colin: ….

632
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.820
Andrew Harshman: Tomb Raider.

633
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.550
Colin: Sure.

634
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:46.339
Colin: I never played Tomb Raider, I've never played Castlevania, so I'm probably a bad, like.

635
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:58.990
Colin: truly not a good platformer, enthusiast. But I like them as a… as a delivery vehicle for… for game. I really liked Dead Cells, so I'm comparing a lot of my…

636
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:17.350
Colin: thoughts on this were, like… I mean, Dead Cells is not the same game at all, but it is a platformer, and the way that I felt when I was going through something like Dead Cells is very smooth, and you feel powerful, and…

637
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.230
Colin: fast and fluid, versus this, I just felt

638
01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:33.670
Colin: bad at video games, and then I'd die, and then I'd restart again, and I'd feel bad again, and it was just very frustrating. And…

639
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:35.000
Colin: it…

640
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:45.469
Colin: really, I hated the whip. I hate the whip so much. I could… I could not get a handle on it, and maybe it was… the problem was that I shouldn't have been trying to use it as much.

641
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.740
Colin: But then also just, like.

642
01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:54.339
Colin: I did not find the conceit of the game as interesting, like….

643
01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:59.659
Woody: you're exploring a cave, and then you get to the end of the cave, and you go to the next level. Yeah, oh, no, 100%.

644
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:17.559
Woody: a game… like, I think… I really like this game's aesthetic, I think it looks great, but, like, it is not, like, oh, I want to know more about the lore of the cave, like, it does… Dead Cells at least, like, gives the vibes of, like, oh, I'm in this interesting world, and there's, like, weird monsters and sort of weird vibes around here.

645
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:30.479
Scott Burger: And it's… and it's interesting that for a game that's, like, such a titanic mover of the genre, like, this is… this, I think, like, Spelunky 2008, and then, like, that building the hype for the 2012 release is…

646
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:42.099
Scott Burger: like, new roguedom. Like, before that, roguelike games, like, were not popular, they were not fun, outside of, like, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games. Like, they didn't sell well, like, they were not commercial successes. This was, like…

647
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:55.100
Scott Burger: oh, hey, what if, like, someone who was good at game design took all the good parts of, like, these old traditional roguelike games and put them into a fun setting like a Mario game? And I think that, like, there's… there's, like, an allegory here of, like.

648
01:07:55.100 --> 01:08:04.850
Scott Burger: Spelunky being, like, the… the titular, like, zero-meta progression, like, arcade-style rogue… rogue-like game,

649
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.149
Scott Burger: Feels like it's… it's like the nuclear throne.

650
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:18.550
Scott Burger: to, like, how Rogue Legacy is, like, to enter the Gungeon. And what I mean by that is, like, Nuclear Throne is, like, way smaller scope than Enter the Gungeon.

651
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.349
Woody: Another throne predate Gungeon?

652
01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.560
Scott Burger: I'm pretty sure it does, yeah.

653
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.010
Woody: Okay, carry on. I'll fact check you.

654
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:39.559
Scott Burger: Like, Nuclear Throne, way smaller scope, way faster, you die a lot more, there's no meta-progression, there's, like, basically no story, it's like, oh, I've gotta go and ascend the Nuclear Throne, great. Versus, like, Rogue Legacy and Enter the Gungeon, it's much more progression-based, it's a lot…

655
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:54.559
Scott Burger: more forgiving, more… it's slower, it's, you know, less punishing, and I feel like those have… like, that style of game is maybe more appealing, generally, because the

656
01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.880
Scott Burger: Like, that's… that's the draw. Like, the draw is like, oh yeah, it'll… like, it's hard, it's a hard game, but…

657
01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:12.079
Scott Burger: if you stick with it, like, the game will just, like, let you get better at it regardless if you're, like, a super, like, highly skilled twitchy gamer or not. It will just….

658
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:26.079
Woody: Yeah, your character will sort of get stronger, and, like, Dead Cells has those elements very much so, because you're… you're continually, like, pumping souls into the forge, which, you know, keeps leveling up your weapons.

659
01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:34.309
Woody: You're getting new abilities, and for those following along at home, yeah, Nuclear Throne came out 2015, Gungeon came out 2016.

660
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.089
Scott Burger: Oh yeah, oh yeah, talk about fashion.

661
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:39.150
Colin: So, I would say for me, like.

662
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:52.499
Colin: I… I'm probably a bad roguelike player. I am definitely a roguelite of… of… Sure. If you know what I mean. Like, I… I play video games to feel like I am making progress.

663
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.060
Woody: Yeah.

664
01:09:53.069 --> 01:10:08.819
Colin: And, you know, the more we've done this podcast, the more I've realized that I don't actually care if I am making progress and getting better. I just want to feel like I'm getting better. Like, you know, there's a subtle difference between them, and roguelike elements will make it so it's like.

665
01:10:09.019 --> 01:10:15.059
Colin: boy, you're getting better at this game. It's like, am I? Let's just not examine that too hard. I'm getting further.

666
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:24.189
Woody: That's a really smart observation, Colin. I like that point a lot, of, like, this… because, like, I think Hades does a really good job of that. It's like…

667
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:33.730
Woody: by the time you're, you know, 10 or 15 hours into Hades, your character is just more powerful, and you feel like you've gotten better at the game.

668
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.620
Colin: And you probably have, but yeah, you probably have.

669
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:42.290
Woody: It really doesn't matter, because you're getting farther than you did before, and like, that's what you care about.

670
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:50.100
Andrew Harshman: And to your point, Colin, … I sat down this morning to try to beat this game.

671
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:55.580
Andrew Harshman: And… It took me at least an hour to get to the third biome.

672
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.689
Andrew Harshman: I, like, I've been playing this game a lot.

673
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:10.489
Andrew Harshman: I feel like I got the movement down pretty good, I feel like I got a pretty good handle on the mechanics, and it is still… the first level is still tough. Yep. …

674
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:21.380
Andrew Harshman: And… real quick, just to remind everybody, … I didn't beat Battletoads, but I got darn close. I've beaten a number of the, like, old school…

675
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:26.020
Andrew Harshman: Castlevania games. I've beaten Ninja Gaiden 1. Oh, that.

676
01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:26.720
Woody: Oh, ugh.

677
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.830
Andrew Harshman: Which, ….

678
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:41.659
Woody: That game is so cruel… you talk about a cruel game. That game, you get to the last boss, which is a very, very hard last boss, and if you die, you go back to the start of the level. Not the start of the boss, the start of the level.

679
01:11:41.990 --> 01:12:01.880
Andrew Harshman: Brutal. And but, so, that is to say, like, I'm not terrible at platformers, and but yeah, this is, Spelunky… I've been saying this on our Discord a fair bit, and I've been saying this to just people who I've been talking about this game. Just people on the street! Just on the street!

680
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.560
Woody: You've just been out there with a sign.

681
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.769
Colin: He's been berating his wife about this game.

682
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:19.770
Andrew Harshman: I walked up to my friendly local barista, and I said, so I'm playing Spelunky, and let me tell ya, it is absolutely living up to its reputation. That reputation being that it's a bastard of a game, and boy is it.

683
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:40.549
Scott Burger: Woody, I'm curious, from your perspective, like, you are no stranger to these exceedingly difficult games. For the listener's benefit, Woody and I were roommates in college, and I remember the day when… and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure, like, that was when you beat Battletoads for the first time, right?

684
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:43.909
Woody: Yeah, we… I remember this too, this is a very seminal memory

685
01:12:44.250 --> 01:13:02.899
Woody: I beat Battletoads, like, for the first time, and then I'm like, oh man, I'm running, I'm running hot. I was so hyped. I remember I ran up and down the hall of our game, and then, I'm like, alright, I gotta ride this, and then I played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, and then I beat Mike Tyson for the first time.

686
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.349
Colin: In a row?

687
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.899
Woody: What do you mean? Back to back?

688
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.609
Colin: You beat Battletoes, then you immediately beat Mike Tyson?

689
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:16.040
Woody: Yeah. Wow. I mean, no, I had to, like, fight Mike Tyson many times, but, like, it was the same day.

690
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.840
Colin: That's what I mean, yeah. It's incredible. Yeah. Incredible.

691
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.440
Woody: And then, like, yeah, so, I was running hot.

692
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.950
Scott Burger: Yeah, so, but, like.

693
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.759
Scott Burger: You, you have, like, this kind of, intrinsic draw to these very challenging and difficult games.

694
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.270
Woody: Sure.

695
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:39.150
Scott Burger: Was that the draw to Spelunky at the time? It's like, oh, this is, like, another legendarily difficult Battletoads-level game, I need to summit that mountain, like, was that….

696
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:39.500
Woody: Oh!

697
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.670
Scott Burger: At the time, the drawing?

698
01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:52.499
Woody: I didn't know that, because, like, when I first played it, because, like, it hadn't developed that reputation, and I guess I don't even think of it that way, like, because I feel like…

699
01:13:53.700 --> 01:14:08.640
Woody: I don't know, it's like, those games… like, Battletoads, like… the difficulty in Battletoads is just bad and busted, and, like, doesn't make sense, and is not fair. Like, I… I am… I am totally get that, and it's, like, very much, like…

700
01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:17.089
Woody: a smashing your head against the wall and just trying… like, that is the prime example of a game that you memorize. You don't necessarily get to.

701
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:21.770
Andrew Harshman: about way earlier, You, you memorize the levels, because they are each….

702
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:23.500
Woody: Yeah, and I….

703
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.410
Andrew Harshman: designs.

704
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:28.789
Woody: I just started playing Spelunky, And just like…

705
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:40.160
Woody: continued to play Spelunky, because, like, the act of playing it, I found very pleasurable, and then when I died, I'm like, well, I guess I get to play more Spelunky now.

706
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:49.069
Woody: And that's not to say there weren't many, and still are, many memories of very frustrating things about this game.

707
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.860
Woody: But… I guess, like, it never felt… it's never felt totally cheap, and just cruel the way…

708
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.349
Woody: you know, Battletoads does.

709
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:07.850
Woody: Just for example. I remember… So, yeah, it wasn't… when I got to the phase of trying to…

710
01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.730
Woody: you know, consciously, like, beat a hell run, to see those more mechanics. …

711
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:19.960
Woody: That is where it starts to feel more that way, because…

712
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:25.980
Woody: Like, you need things to go right in order for that to work, and like…

713
01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:30.940
Woody: so it can be frustrating when that doesn't work out, but if I'm just playing a run.

714
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:47.230
Woody: to see what happens and try to beat it, like, I don't really care, like, I will… if I see a shop with a shotgun and a jetpack in it, I'm killing that shopkeeper. And, like, I'm gonna see what happens. Nothing personal. Because I am not… I'm not worried about it.

715
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.389
Andrew Harshman: It's just business, that business being archaeology.

716
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:52.870
Woody: Yeah, exactly.

717
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:56.829
Colin: It is fair. You're, you're, you're tomb robbing. You're Tomb Raider.

718
01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.159
Andrew Harshman: That business being Tomb Robbery, yes.

719
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.449
Woody: And I guess, to me, that's, like, another thing that I just really…

720
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:09.469
Woody: Respect about this game is, like… I never noticed…

721
01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:29.319
Woody: its hardness, like, obviously I know… I noticed its difficulty because I was dying all the time, and I still do, but I didn't notice it in the same way that I do for those games that, like, you know, are quote-unquote, like, the massive… like, the games you play solely for difficulty.

722
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:37.350
Andrew Harshman: Sure, it's difficult in a different way, for sure, for sure, in a own uniquely cruel way. No, yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely different.

723
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:39.400
Woody: Yeah, and I mean, to me, though, that's like…

724
01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:46.129
Woody: That, at its core, is, like, what rogue… rogue games are about, is that…

725
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:49.740
Woody: Dying is just a part of the game, and like…

726
01:16:50.230 --> 01:17:02.389
Woody: if the game is intrinsically pleasurable, it does not matter how much you die. Like, if something interesting happens, and you had a good time, and you, like, learned one lesson of, like.

727
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:10.290
Woody: Like, I just learned one, like, you can go into… one of the bonus levels is you can get sucked in by a big bug.

728
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:21.680
Woody: And you, like, go down his stomach, and you get, like, a special knife. For all you guys complaining about the whip, you can get, like, a crystal knife that, has a slightly better range and kills enemies instantly.

729
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.319
Scott Burger: Crucially, it's a crisp knife from Dune.

730
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:41.469
Woody: Yeah, because you go into a big sandworm. And then I'm like, this run is going great, I'm gonna go into the Alien Mothership, another bonus level, and I shotgunned down some of these turrets, and then I'm like, what's going on with these turrets? And I hit one of them with my knife, and it exploded.

731
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:57.189
Woody: Which, you know, was maybe as close as I've ever experienced to, like, hey, that felt like random BS in, in the world of Spelunky, but I'm not sure I'd ever seen that interaction before. So, even, you know, 50, 60 hours in, still learning new things.

732
01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:04.270
Scott Burger: I remember when I first picked up Spelunky, I think it was, this was the very first Rogue game I bought on Steam.

733
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:17.549
Scott Burger: And November 2013, so the year of release, I think I got it for $4, and I was, like, at the time I was so engrossed in it, I remember specifically, it was the, it was the January 1st, 2013,

734
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:24.490
Scott Burger: Colts vs. Chiefs playoff game, where there was, like, this, like, one of the biggest come-from-behind victories in playoff football history.

735
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:34.709
Scott Burger: And I was just completely ignoring it, because I was playing Spelunky on my laptop. Sure. I'm like, goddammit, I'm gonna beat this level! And I'm, like, throwing my wireless 360 controller across the room and stuff.

736
01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:43.100
Andrew Harshman: And that's when you… and that's when you threw the himbo into the exit. Oh, alright! Anyway, yeah.

737
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:51.289
Scott Burger: But I remember bouncing off of it at the time, because it was punishingly difficult. I didn't really understand why it was so lauded at the time.

738
01:18:51.290 --> 01:19:04.300
Scott Burger: And it took me, like, until June 2015, scrolling through my Steam purchase history here, to get Risk of Rain 1, which was, like, that was the gateway drug. So, like, I played Spelunky.

739
01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.940
Scott Burger: I was engrossed in it enough at the time, I didn't beat it at the time.

740
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:18.949
Scott Burger: But, like, I bounced off it, because I'm like, yeah, but it's, I don't know, it's just, like, another Meat Boy, or something. Sure. And, like, sure, yeah, it's difficult, and I thought, at the time, difficult for difficult's sake.

741
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:33.239
Scott Burger: But having… having played enough of these and really thinking and thinking about it critically and coming back to it, I'm like, wow, like, it's so polished for… for how pared down it is compared to something… well, I mean, Noita is also very polished.

742
01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:44.600
Scott Burger: But, like, Noita, or, Splunky crawled, crawled with its belly across the cavern floor, so that way Noita could, jetpack across, to victory. …

743
01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:53.460
Scott Burger: and yeah, I feel like it's just so foundational, like, of opening up the doors to all these systems, of like, oh, hey, actually, like, these rogue systems from all these, like…

744
01:19:53.670 --> 01:20:02.289
Scott Burger: incredibly terse and, like, 150 keyboard command type games, like, can actually be fun if you apply it to the right medium.

745
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:19.110
Scott Burger: Speaking of run types, … so, like, we talked about a standard run, Woody kind of touched on, a Hell Run, which requires getting… yeah, getting, like, the Wadjet eye from the mines, the Ankh from the black market, which gives you an extra life, the Head Jet from.

746
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:24.129
Woody: Yeah, it gives you an extra life, but if you die, it uses the onk, and so you can't…

747
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.570
Woody: Unlock the secret, so you have to get it and not die.

748
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:43.530
Scott Burger: Well, and then you have to crucially kill yourself next to a giant moai head in the ice caves to activate it, which spits you back out of the Moai head, wearing a cool head helmet that's made of gold.

749
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.059
Woody: That's what they call them. Head helmets made of gold.

750
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:57.119
Scott Burger: And then you get, you kill Anubis in the temple to get his scepter, which, like, with all of the… well, actually, I think you only need the scepter and the head jet, technically. …

751
01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:06.239
Scott Burger: and so there's creative ways around this that I'll get to in a second, but, like, you use the scepter as a key to open the… the…

752
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:15.000
Scott Burger: Golden Door in, I think the second stage of the temple, to go to the City of Gold, and that's where, like, you can just get your daily.

753
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.070
Andrew Harshman: Where everyone wears head helmets made of gold.

754
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.460
Andrew Harshman: I've been laughing off-camera about this.

755
01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.790
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, sorry.

756
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.859
Scott Burger: And so, so….

757
01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:30.540
Andrew Harshman: Is the Gold City just, like, a treasure-like room, or is it actually, like, a full biome with, ….

758
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.439
Scott Burger: It's like everything's made of gold, right? And then, like, everything that you blow up, it's just, like, it's raining gold, and you're still….

759
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.849
Andrew Harshman: There's head helmets everywhere.

760
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.049
Colin: Are they our enemies?

761
01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.179
Woody: Yeah, there's enemies. Oh, Colin, it wouldn't be spelunky if there weren't.

762
01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.530
Andrew Harshman: Oh, no, okay.

763
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:48.089
Colin: Well, that's what… I think that was Andrew's question, and also….

764
01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:52.660
Woody: No, there's no bonus level. Even the bonus levels in this game still kick your ass.

765
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.320
Colin: I wasn't sure if it was a transition level.

766
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:55.690
Scott Burger: No.

767
01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:56.100
Colin: in your.

768
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.250
Scott Burger: Like a Sonic the Hedgehog, oops, all emeralds.

769
01:21:59.250 --> 01:21:59.700
Woody: Yeah.

770
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:05.530
Colin: Yeah, or like the little, in, in Mario, when you're in little… you go down the thing.

771
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:19.030
Woody: This is, this is totally unrelated, but I just, would like to encourage your listeners, when they're done listening to this podcast, do a YouTube search for, Skull Monkeys, bonus room song.

772
01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:20.010
Woody: …

773
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:25.290
Woody: It's just some random PS1 platformer, but it does have the best bonus room music of any game ever.

774
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:26.760
Andrew Harshman: Oh, alright.

775
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.929
Woody: Alright, anyway, carry on. You make it through the City of Gold.

776
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:37.909
Scott Burger: Yeah, so while people are listening to that funky music, you get to the City of Gold. You pick up some sort of, like, Necronomicon-type, tome.

777
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:53.770
Scott Burger: If you have that, you beat Olmec, that opens up a secret entrance to Hell, which is, like, right above the lava zone there. So, like, you have to… you have to bait Olmec to, like, crushing down, like, the entrance specifically, like, by the lava.

778
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:59.099
Scott Burger: He, like, Olmec is disposed of, you go to the, you go to hell, and it's like…

779
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:05.149
Scott Burger: if you didn't think Spelunky was hard enough, and you were like, you know what, I want something to just, like.

780
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:15.209
Scott Burger: be… be so comically difficult, it's almost like, basically YouTube streamer bait. That's your hell option here. You get to King Yama.

781
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:30.100
Scott Burger: who I think is maybe a more appropriate final boss design for this game, and he's, like, 3 screens tall, he has, like, hands that, like, remove from his body and fly around, there's en- like, all sorts of different enemies attacking you, …

782
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:36.179
Scott Burger: And, yeah, beating him gives you, like, you know, the secret ending and a lot more points or whatever, but….

783
01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:36.790
Andrew Harshman: ….

784
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:48.229
Scott Burger: But, crucially, this ties into maybe one of the, like… I'm struggling to think of a crazier optional challenge mode in maybe all of gaming.

785
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:51.170
Scott Burger: then something called the Eggplant Run.

786
01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.480
Andrew Harshman: Excuse me?

787
01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.059
Scott Burger: Woody, are you familiar with those?

788
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:55.220
Colin: ….

789
01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.789
Woody: I'm not sure we are allowed to do this on our podcast.

790
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:59.820
Andrew Harshman: Family show.

791
01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:18.750
Scott Burger: The E stands for educational on the, on the bit there. But, so the eggplant run is… like, the history from it comes from, like, people toying around with the Xbox 360 release, and then seeing, like, oh, if I take this mystery box from the shop, and I sacrifice it on one of the Kali altars, I get this little eggplant. Oh, that's a…

792
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:27.829
Scott Burger: That's a cute little throwaway thing, whatever. And it's a very fragile little thing that, like, if you touch it wrong, it'll… it'll explode, or, like, you know, fall apart. It's like a… like a clay pod.

793
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:28.820
Andrew Harshman: Oh, yeah?

794
01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:32.120
Scott Burger: level of fragility. So, but…

795
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:39.609
Scott Burger: someone was digging around through files or something and found a thing that's like, oh, there's, like, this eggplant monster in, like, the game's files.

796
01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.450
Andrew Harshman: I'll bet.

797
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:53.460
Scott Burger: something, right? And once the game was released on PC, PC gamers do their thing and datamine the shit out of it, and find the interaction of the eggplant with King Yama.

798
01:24:53.810 --> 01:25:00.339
Scott Burger: Where if you throw the eggplant at King Yama's face, he turns it into a big eggplant.

799
01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:00.950
Andrew Harshman: Where….

800
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:05.970
Scott Burger: You can just… you can just whip him with… for a one-hit KO, and kill him.

801
01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.489
Scott Burger: But the, the….

802
01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:10.960
Andrew Harshman: Interesting bit about this is how… just how….

803
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:12.680
Scott Burger: comically difficult.

804
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:32.209
Scott Burger: it is to do this, because you have to… you have to get the RNG in order to get a shop and a Kali altar on the same floor, usually in, like, the first biome. You pick up, like, the mystery package, you sacrifice it, and hope that that gives you an eggplant, so there's already the RNG filter there. You…

805
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:34.670
Scott Burger: … Gosh, what is my favorite.

806
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.529
Andrew Harshman: And this was secret for,

807
01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:39.699
Scott Burger: Yeah, and I believe Derek W was like….

808
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:44.810
Woody: hire… every so often, you'll get, shops that let you hire a helping hand.

809
01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:56.699
Woody: Which are, like, little assistants that follow you around, but have absolutely, you know, terrible AI, and as is mostly the case in Spelunky, will cause some accidental chain reaction that makes you die.

810
01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:02.739
Woody: But because you need to be holding, like, the scepter.

811
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:15.169
Woody: to get into the City of Gold, and you also only have to be holding the eggplant to bring it in, you have to, like, have one of these guys carry the eggplant, behind you without letting.

812
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:19.539
Scott Burger: He did die. Or, Woody, if you are Bananasaurus Rex.

813
01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:38.240
Scott Burger: possibly the best Spelunky player, maybe Spelunky 1 player of all time, you do it solo by item-juggling the eggplant and all the other items back and forth, while ghost dodging… we didn't even talk about the ghost, but, like, ghost dodging across the map.

814
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:46.530
Scott Burger: blowing up two other Kali altars in order to get a, a ball and chain where you have, like, an actual, like.

815
01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:55.729
Scott Burger: like, prisoner big ball, like, chained to your leg, which is another thing you have to juggle, which will come in… will be important here in a second. …

816
01:26:55.990 --> 01:27:08.819
Scott Burger: you're making your way to the ice caves. Somehow, if this wasn't already hard enough, you use the ball and chain to break open the moai head in the ice caves.

817
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.829
Scott Burger: And then you…

818
01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:17.130
Scott Burger: The way that he did it, at least, was to use, like, the climbing gloves to, like.

819
01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:35.660
Scott Burger: climb up against the side of the wall of the… of the ice caves, because there's a bottomless pit at the end of it, or the bottom of it, that will insta-kill you. But if you, like, climbing wall your, your way down, the ball hangs down, the ball will get deleted by the insta-kill zone.

820
01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:41.259
Andrew Harshman: freeing you. Also, crucially, the reason why for the ball and chain, so you use the ball and chain to, like.

821
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:58.750
Scott Burger: break open the Moai head, so that way you don't need to go to the black market and get the onk to sacrifice yourself, you see. You break open the Moai head using this ball and chain. You dip it down into, like, the kill zone. You dip your ball into the kill zone? Yep.

822
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.390
Woody: In order to move the eggplant.

823
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:03.970
Scott Burger: Yes, and then, you grab your eggplant, you, …

824
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:22.090
Scott Burger: I may be missing a step here in my Google Doc, but, you, you, get the head jet through the, through the Moai head, which allows you to carry stuff through subsequent levels. You then go all the stuff through the temple to get the, the, …

825
01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:41.850
Scott Burger: the Book of the Dead, the… the Scepter, also, and you're juggling all these things, you… you finally get to Hell, you're, like, cradling this fragile eggplant all the way through this, like, menagerie of chaos that we've described so far. And then you get to King Yama.

826
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:46.519
Scott Burger: Bananasaurus Rex did this with 1 HP remaining.

827
01:28:47.110 --> 01:29:03.339
Scott Burger: throws it at King Yama's face, turns him into a giant purple eggplant, and King Yama's, like, frozen. He can't throw any more spikes and energy balls at you, just waiting for that whip to just come open and just slice his big, juicy eggplant head open.

828
01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:17.590
Scott Burger: He did it, he posted it to YouTube, and, like, the… at the time, when it was called Twitter, folk, ask your grandpa again, Twitter and YouTube just exploded, of, like, this was not possible, this was something that the developers said, like.

829
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:36.059
Scott Burger: the eggplant run can't be done, they denied the existence of Purple King Yama, even though they left in the mechanic of, of the ball and chain, blowing up the moe head, which was unintentional, but Derek Yu saw it and was like, you know what, that's good, that's, like, so cool, I'm just gonna leave it in there. …

830
01:29:36.190 --> 01:29:50.059
Scott Burger: And, yeah, like, that has, like, entered the lore of, like, on the level of, like, those Half-Life 2 gnome runs, where people carry the gnome through the entirety of Half-Life 2 to put it in the spaceship, or the rocket at the very end, it's like….

831
01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:50.380
Colin: Damn.

832
01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:50.970
Andrew Harshman: But I mean….

833
01:29:50.970 --> 01:30:04.899
Colin: Describing doing that run sounded like describing a dream. Like, a child describing a dream, and then the ball, and the lava, and then he climbed up, and then King Yama, and….

834
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:05.750
Andrew Harshman: Absolutely.

835
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:12.999
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, that's, I… Scott, I cannot think of a more difficult….

836
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.299
Woody: Optional challenge mode, either.

837
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:19.180
Andrew Harshman: Very impressive. And the name of that player is what again?

838
01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:21.330
Woody: Oh, Bananasaurus Rex.

839
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:25.869
Andrew Harshman: Manasaurus Rex, what a hero. And also, what a hero dev for not patching out

840
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:30.870
Andrew Harshman: That, the ability to destroy the head with, the ball and chain.

841
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:36.280
Woody: Well, that, I mean, that is kind of the, …

842
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:53.819
Woody: I don't know, that feels like once that has happened, like, you've reached the outer limits of Spelunky. You have spelunked all that could be spelunked, but, like, I'm still perfectly content just, like, making runs of this game and seeing what kind of stuff happens, and, like, I'm gonna have a good time. I…

843
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.479
Woody: Are you guys, at some future date, gonna talk Spelunky 2?

844
01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:08.020
Scott Burger: You know, we've gotten more requests for Spelunky 2 than 1, but I thought it would make more sense for us to cover for the big 75th episode.

845
01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:08.410
Andrew Harshman: Oh, yeah.

846
01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:20.989
Scott Burger: Avaganza, and a listener request episode to do, like, obviously doing Spelunky 1 first. Yeah. Spelunky 2, like, from what I've dabbled with it, it feels very… it's almost like in a, …

847
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:32.179
Scott Burger: Like, if this one that we're talking about right now, Spelunky HD, is the remaster of 2008.1, Spelunky 2 feels like the remaster of the Spelunky HD version.

848
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.089
Scott Burger: I… Does that make sense?

849
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:53.520
Woody: Yeah, I was super hyped for Spelunky 2, when it was coming out, because I was all in on Spelunky, and I have never… I have never quite clicked on it. I have, I think, you know, 12 hours in it. I think I've made it to the third world. It's just…

850
01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.550
Woody: it…

851
01:31:54.580 --> 01:32:06.539
Woody: the praise that I leveled on Spelunky about, like, feeling like it doesn't have a bunch of extra rules and stuff you have to figure out, like, Spelunky 2 feels like it has

852
01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:17.289
Woody: more rules, and more stuff you have to figure out, and stuff that kind of just exists in the game to add content. And I'm willing to be wrong, now that…

853
01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:19.299
Woody: Talking, or …

854
01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:32.490
Woody: being on this podcast has reminded me that I love Spelunky, and, like, so maybe I will make another attempt to try and crack through that Spelunky 2 wall, because I'm confident I can get there. It's also…

855
01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:43.840
Woody: It's also weird, because I was at the point where I'm like, oh, I can beat original Spelunky, like, 70% of my runs, and then, like, I started playing Spelunky 2, and I'm like, oh, I'm just dying in the first world every time again.

856
01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.779
Scott Burger: It's like riding a bike again for the first time.

857
01:32:46.780 --> 01:33:01.810
Woody: Anyway, I'm happy to talk Spelunky 2 for whenever you guys get there, and Colin is, like… Colin's, like, … you know the cartoon dust cloud? Where, like, someone runs away, and all that's left is the dust cloud? That'll be Colin when we talk Spelunky 2.

858
01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:02.480
Scott Burger: I have….

859
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.570
Andrew Harshman: Possibly.

860
01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:04.369
Scott Burger: I have in mind.

861
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:07.029
Colin: Or maybe that'll be the one, maybe it'll just… just…

862
01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.350
Colin: Oh, yeah. I mean, I appreciate Splunky, this game. I….

863
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:13.740
Andrew Harshman: What do you appreciate about it?

864
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:18.129
Colin: I see why people might like it.

865
01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:19.220
Andrew Harshman: Oh, okay.

866
01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:24.960
Colin: It does have a lot of systems that seem to interact very well. It's got…

867
01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.450
Colin: an elegance to it.

868
01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.740
Colin: ….

869
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:29.800
Andrew Harshman: Yes.

870
01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.460
Colin: It's just not….

871
01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.530
Andrew Harshman: Elegant design.

872
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:32.830
Colin: for me.

873
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.830
Colin: what I'm looking for when I'm playing a video game.

874
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.120
Colin: For the most part.

875
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:56.670
Scott Burger: And speaking of, before we jump into ratings and similar game stuff here, some community correspondence here. So I put the question out, of, like, you know, what is, what are people's thoughts about Spelunky these days, and got some good write-ins here. So, I'll bounce back and forth between, between these, but, …

876
01:33:56.670 --> 01:34:02.409
Scott Burger: One from, CoolUsername1111, says that,

877
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:02.979
Andrew Harshman: That is cool.

878
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:10.149
Scott Burger: Gold standard for the genre. Every death feels simultaneously utter bullshit, and 100% my fault.

879
01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:32.620
Scott Burger: This one from, with a bunch of threes and zeros in his name, but, RetroGamer83, says, I never liked the game. When I play a roguelike slash light, I'm looking for crazy builds and game-breaking combos. Spelunky never gave me those things. It reminded me more of a 2D Souls-like than a roguelike.

880
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:49.899
Woody: I think that you… I mean, the game-breaking com… I think there are ways to achieve game-breaking combos. They probably require a level of attention and depth that, you know, is beyond just, like, popping the game in. Like, you can do weird stuff with, like, the teleporter button.

881
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:54.240
Woody: In terms of, like, blasting through levels in weird ways, and, like.

882
01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.269
Woody: The jetpack and shotgun is as broken as you're gonna get.

883
01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:00.930
Scott Burger: But it's not like the vampire survivals… survive.

884
01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:13.409
Woody: No, you're right, it doesn't have that same visceral feeling. Like, as useful and powerful as you feel with the shotgun and jetpack and Spelunky, you know that, like, one random beam or spike is still gonna kill you.

885
01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:15.400
Andrew Harshman: Some random spike. Yeah, it's true.

886
01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:22.199
Scott Burger: This one's a little longer, but I'll end with a shorter one. One from Five Dozen Whales.

887
01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:36.360
Scott Burger: It says, Spelunky nails what I think makes a good roguelike. Beginners die every 30 seconds, experts can win streaks. It's hard, but rarely unfair. When you start, it feels clunky, the delayed whip and bombs seem badly designed, nailing jumps feels impossible, but…

888
01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:54.010
Scott Burger: But as you get practice under your belt, you realize that it's extremely responsive. The controls are some of the best in any platformer. You start feeling like a ninja, bouncing off of enemies' heads into back whips and throwing bombs perfectly, and yeah, you do get spelunked occasionally and die in a way that's not your fault, or that was only barely avoidable.

889
01:35:54.010 --> 01:36:17.579
Scott Burger: But when that happens, it's usually funny. It gives you a story to tell or a clip to share. You never feel defeated, you feel eager to jump back in. A lot of hard platformers are simply clunky and unfair. They're hard because there's a skill ceiling, not a skill curve. A lot of roguelikes rely too much or too little on luck. Experts might not fare much better than beginners. Spelunky is smooth, fair, and has just enough luck.

890
01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.270
Scott Burger: Luck.

891
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:24.350
Andrew Harshman: I don't agree with all of that, but I do absolutely agree with the controls. This…

892
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:39.260
Andrew Harshman: game has some tight controls, and they're difficult to master, but they are more or less predictable and, pretty responsive, and I think that is…

893
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:46.569
Andrew Harshman: Maybe one of the first challenges in this game is… is mastering just moving around, and jumping around, and ledge grabbing, and…

894
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:52.419
Andrew Harshman: When you get a handle on it, it feels pretty good.

895
01:36:52.990 --> 01:37:16.690
Scott Burger: And I'll say from the clipping perspective, like, I was doing the daily challenge run every day for the past two weeks, just to, like, let's just see what happens. Let's… I'm not going for a win here, I'm just interested to see what happens. And it has gotten some pretty clippable moments between, missing a bat by one frame, and then getting killed by the subsequent bat, like, 2 seconds later. It's given me, like…

896
01:37:16.690 --> 01:37:24.720
Scott Burger: some… some very, Type 2 fun clips to share of, like, Getting beaned by, …

897
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:44.720
Scott Burger: impossible-to-kill, shopkeeps, or, like, cool, like, ghost baiting and dodging and stuff, and, like, whenever I'm sharing a clip in the Discord, and, like, you know, Andrew and Colin and maybe Will is watching, who knows, and, you know, you're seeing, like, okay, the level's starting, this is gonna end badly somehow.

898
01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.050
Scott Burger: But how badly is it gonna end? And I was watching those clips myself, like, back and forth, like, the next day, and like.

899
01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:57.899
Scott Burger: Okay, yeah, I could have avoided that, like, that was pretty, pretty well telegraphed. There was maybe one that was kind of bullshit, but….

900
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:01.860
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, there's some of those clips where it's like, you have to do a little bit of CSI, work.

901
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:13.710
Andrew Harshman: to, like, figure out, alright, what actually killed you in this case? And there's always… there's always a logical explanation, but sometimes…

902
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:17.510
Andrew Harshman: in the moment, it's like, man, I don't even know what got me.

903
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:29.360
Scott Burger: And this last, comment from, Fishman465 says, IMO, the game requires the ability to laugh at your own deaths.

904
01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.179
Andrew Harshman: Well, that comes easier to some than others.

905
01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:54.329
Andrew Harshman: Yes, I think everyone would do well to remember their breathing exercises, and to remain zen, while playing this game. And not to yell too loud, lest you bother your significant other. Hey, cool username, RetroGamer, Thousandwhales fishman.

906
01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:58.989
Andrew Harshman: Thank you for your input. Much appreciated. Thank you for weighing in.

907
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:05.639
Woody: I do think a weight is lifted off of the player once you make a successful run. Like, once you get through

908
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:22.119
Woody: and defeat Olmec once, you're like, okay, you can either be done with it, or you can be like, okay, now I'm just gonna play, and not get upset, and just, like, see what happens, and see what I want to explore, and, like, engage with the weird secrets of this game. …

909
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:28.870
Woody: And not… yeah, because I've… I've beaten it. I can at least feel… I can feel content that I have made it through.

910
01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:45.820
Scott Burger: Yeah, I think the, the standard run of this game is fun. There's, … like, Woody and I were up past midnight, I guess technically today, playing, playing some of the co-op, and, like, it, you know, the co-op isn't… isn't great, but… or, well, the…

911
01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:52.779
Scott Burger: Let me rephrase, the co-op standard adventure mode is kind of meh, like, the screen sharing feels very.

912
01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:57.989
Woody: Right, it's not split screen, so you essentially have to follow one… it's the, the tail.

913
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.640
Andrew Harshman: Central.

914
01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.849
Woody: One character has to play as Tails, where they're constantly left behind.

915
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:05.110
Andrew Harshman: Speaking of Battletoads, ….

916
01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:12.299
Woody: Oh, yeah. It is also… it is the Battletoad symptom of, if you play the two-player game, the game is way harder. Yeah.

917
01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:23.810
Scott Burger: Yeah, and like Woody, you were pointing out, when I was just about to pick up the, the Anubis Scepter, you're like, maybe you don't want to do that, because as soon as you use it, it's gonna attack me, and like.

918
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:37.389
Scott Burger: oh, okay, that, like, I was simultaneously disappointed, and I'm like, wow, okay, yeah, that does make sense from the game design standpoint of, like, it's gonna home in on stuff, and, like, Woody's character is stuff.

919
01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:43.390
Woody: Thanks, Scott! That's a really nice thing you said to me. Woody's character is stuff.

920
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:44.180
Andrew Harshman: Oh my….

921
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:47.509
Scott Burger: But, but, but when you found….

922
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:53.720
Andrew Harshman: the golden head statue. Which one of you, wore it? I mean, helmet. I screwed up the joke! Anyway, ….

923
01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.489
Scott Burger: Head and helmet.

924
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:54.920
Andrew Harshman: disappointed.

925
01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.309
Woody: the head.

926
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:57.929
Andrew Harshman: here, that it's not…

927
01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:10.179
Andrew Harshman: both players don't have their own screen. I thought just all the players would be running around on their own instance, but sharing the level, and that sounded like a lot of fun! But the fact that you're on the same… you're stuck on the same screen, that kind of….

928
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:18.189
Scott Burger: I think the game would be way easier in that sense, and probably, like, that might be, like, a lot harder to code, so I can't really fault a 2012 game for not having.

929
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.979
Andrew Harshman: Oh, sure, it's just a little disappointing to hear, I guess.

930
01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.470
Scott Burger: Yeah.

931
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:29.209
Andrew Harshman: I thought it could be a… potentially a very good co-op game. I wonder if Spelunky 2 has a….

932
01:41:29.210 --> 01:41:32.990
Woody: 2 has more in-depth co-op features. Okay.

933
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:37.270
Andrew Harshman: Like, what I'm imagining. Right, right, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. But, what do you, what do you and I….

934
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:52.549
Scott Burger: we're having a good time in the deathmatch mode, upsetting 99 bombs, and how many wins we could get in, I don't know, 5 minutes or something. It was, like, a good zany, like, you're having friends over for a pizza party, just throw this on, and they're just gonna bomb each other and have fun.

935
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:53.500
Woody: Yeah, it was fun.

936
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:53.970
Scott Burger: Yeah.

937
01:41:53.970 --> 01:42:00.919
Andrew Harshman: Alright, I can dig it. And is there… real quick, is there a mechanic for spawning one player back in?

938
01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:07.330
Woody: Yes. When you play the co-op, at the start of every level, there will be a coffin.

939
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:20.919
Woody: Where if somebody has died in a previous level, they will get reanimated as a ghost, and they can kind of blow things around, but then when you get to the start of a new level and open the coffin, their character will come back.

940
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.500
Andrew Harshman: Okay. Duly noted.

941
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.440
Woody: Oh, do you have any more to spelunk, Scott?

942
01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:30.960
Scott Burger: That's a great question, I think we've kind of….

943
01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.020
Woody: touched on all of the things in my 28 pages of show notes here. Got good music.

944
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:36.940
Scott Burger: ….

945
01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:38.380
Andrew Harshman: Music, music.

946
01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:39.739
Scott Burger: Very good. This is really good.

947
01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:41.169
Andrew Harshman: Or your music, even, even.

948
01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:45.689
Colin: The music is something that I can say unequivocally is… I, I, I…

949
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:49.530
Colin: I thought it was a little repetitive at first, but then I realized that I was wrong.

950
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:58.639
Andrew Harshman: I really did not like the saxophones in the tutorial, but the rest of the music, I think, is great.

951
01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:19.649
Scott Burger: Yeah, … really good work here by Eric. I'm just gonna pronounce his name differently every time. I'll just call him Eric, by Eric, who, again, for UFO50, like, if he doesn't win, like, an actual, like, Emmy or something, or, like, Oscar-level thing for, like, the amount of, like.

952
01:43:19.650 --> 01:43:22.890
Scott Burger: sound design that he did for UFO 50. I'm gonna be real mad.

953
01:43:23.770 --> 01:43:29.340
Scott Burger: And, yeah, like… As mad as a shopkeep? As mad as a shopkeeper, of course.

954
01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.809
Andrew Harshman: Bouncing off the wall, hopping mad.

955
01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:37.169
Scott Burger: Yeah, I think, when we do get to that game, obviously we'll have Woody back on there, because you've beaten how many of the.

956
01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:46.670
Woody: I'm currently on 40 of 50 golds in, UFO 50, but, you know, only about maybe 10 of those games count as roguelikes.

957
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:54.019
Scott Burger: True, yeah, so we wouldn't be playing 50 games. Okay. We would be, like, paring it down, obviously, to what's appropriate here, but….

958
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:54.440
Andrew Harshman: Obviously.

959
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.239
Scott Burger: Yeah, stay tuned for sure. We talked shortcuts, yeah, I think…

960
01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:09.719
Scott Burger: … yeah. Do we… do we wanna spelunk into the dark, bottomless pit, of numbers that we've arbitrarily slapped onto this game?

961
01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.370
Andrew Harshman: Hell yeah.

962
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:14.670
Woody: Yeah, let's do it. We're already in, like… this podcast has been the length of, ….

963
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:18.690
Scott Burger: What, 15 spelunky runs at this point? Yeah.

964
01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:24.969
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, I could've died, like, 20 times in this… more. I did the math wrong, anyway.

965
01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:32.650
Colin: I'll pick on Colin first, because I can tell he's getting sleepy from travel and podcasting from on the road. Yeah, I'm in a hotel room right now.

966
01:44:32.650 --> 01:44:33.529
Andrew Harshman: What a guy.

967
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:36.710
Colin: I'm in Central Time, so it's 10.40 for me.

968
01:44:36.710 --> 01:44:37.300
Andrew Harshman: Chee!

969
01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:38.630
Colin: ….

970
01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:40.400
Andrew Harshman: Shh, don't dox yourself.

971
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:44.249
Colin: Yes. All of Central… Central Time America….

972
01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:46.059
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, they know what time zone you're in.

973
01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:56.800
Colin: … So, I feel a little bad. I'm giving this game a 5.7. … I feel like…

974
01:44:57.470 --> 01:45:00.009
Colin: There is a lot about this game that is good.

975
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.540
Colin: I understand why people like it.

976
01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.010
Colin: But I didn't… Enjoy playing it at all.

977
01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:08.560
Woody: Yeah.

978
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:16.979
Colin: And… I felt very frustrated while I was playing it, and at a certain point, it was like.

979
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:24.540
Colin: I… I was, like, my mouse was hovering over it, like, the next day, and I was like, this feels like homework, and I want to play.

980
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.770
Woody: video game instead, and so I….

981
01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:45.610
Colin: played, like, Factorio or something, which is literally a game about… is homework the game. So, I think that's a bad sign for it. There's a lot of stuff that it has… I think all of the aesthetics in it are pretty… pretty excellent, and they hold up really well. Like, it's got…

982
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.139
Colin: The graphics of it are timeless. The music of it is timeless.

983
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.209
Colin: … If you like

984
01:45:53.350 --> 01:46:01.579
Colin: difficult games, I would still recommend it to you. If you don't like Dark Souls or hard platformers, I would not.

985
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:02.460
Woody: Yep.

986
01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:05.380
Woody: I think… I think that's fair. I think this game…

987
01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:11.469
Woody: You know, it is what… this is not a game that attempts to be for everyone.

988
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:20.829
Scott Burger: Well, yeah, crucially, Woody, before you so excitedly jump into your review, let's have Andrew go with his, and then I'll go next. We'll always leave the special guest with the final word.

989
01:46:21.610 --> 01:46:25.380
Andrew Harshman: Yes, we want, we want to make sure that, ….

990
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:26.880
Scott Burger: We end on a high note.

991
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:40.630
Andrew Harshman: Someone with, the proper resume, gets to, say, have the final, mention about it. Okay, well, hey, Colin, let me tell ya, you gave this game a 5.7. If you just stuck with it.

992
01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:50.280
Andrew Harshman: for another, 21 and a half… no, 22 and a half hours, you might have rated it as high as 5.73.

993
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.710
Woody: Now, Woody, you haven't been on in a while, but… so you might have forgotten that.

994
01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:57.690
Scott Burger: My co-host here….

995
01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:09.509
Andrew Harshman: They, they really hoodwinked me. When I first joined, we had one ranking system, and I was like, well, whatever, it's your guys' show, I guess I'll do it, and I started numbering and moving.

996
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:12.239
Scott Burger: These are also edited out from every episode.

997
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:21.010
Andrew Harshman: With these wacky, wild scores, so no one can get mad at me, because, they, midway through my tenure here, completely changed the ranking system, and now my ranking….

998
01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:23.190
Woody: They're changing again next week, by the way.

999
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:41.339
Andrew Harshman: So, anyway, so, so I just figured I'd want to catch you up, Woody. So, scoring 5.73 points, on the Andrew scale, totally arbitrary and, and, you know, very, you know, to each their own scores, pretty respectable, right, right ahead of Dysomancer.

1000
01:47:41.410 --> 01:47:44.509
Andrew Harshman: Right behind Barony.

1001
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:50.300
Andrew Harshman: … And to me, Barony, what it came down to.

1002
01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:56.049
Andrew Harshman: For my, ranking decision was… the traps.

1003
01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:05.629
Andrew Harshman: We complained about the boulder traps in Barony, which of course is a first-person, dungeon, dungeon crawler. …

1004
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:08.510
Andrew Harshman: The boulder? In Barney? Pretty bullshit.

1005
01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.480
Andrew Harshman: Somehow?

1006
01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:13.369
Andrew Harshman: The traps in this game felt…

1007
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:23.419
Andrew Harshman: much worse from experience. And the key difference, how I finally came down to it's like, well, I'm gonna put it, I'm gonna put it in here, does Spelunky go ahead.

1008
01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.530
Andrew Harshman: Or, behind Barony.

1009
01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:28.700
Andrew Harshman: boils down to this. Barony?

1010
01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:46.090
Andrew Harshman: Always, often laughing when I died. Laughing with delight. Whereas with Spelunky, I was almost always enraged, as my partner can attest to. And that is very much, you know, a personal and subjective thing, of course.

1011
01:48:46.090 --> 01:48:46.540
Woody: Sure.

1012
01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.989
Andrew Harshman: And we didn't even… we hardly talked about

1013
01:48:50.200 --> 01:49:00.970
Andrew Harshman: The Ghost. And I do want to mention the Ghost really quickly. Now, listeners, if you haven't played Spelunky, you might think, golly, this sounds like a dangerous game world. Sounds like there's a lot of pitfalls, literal and otherwise.

1014
01:49:01.710 --> 01:49:10.319
Andrew Harshman: Just be careful! Just take your time! Slow down! Well, guess what? If you play too slowly.

1015
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:16.140
Andrew Harshman: A giant fuck-off spectre of death appears

1016
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:20.599
Andrew Harshman: From one of the sides of the screen, and just floats through the level.

1017
01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.959
Andrew Harshman: Threatening to instigib you the moment you make contact with its

1018
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:43.929
Andrew Harshman: Ample hitbox. Ample, I tell you. Now, there were a few instances where I outran the ghost, and I did something really cool and clutch, where, like, oh, I was running along with, like, the damsel, or the himbo, or the puppers, and I was juggling items, and I also had the idol, and, like.

1019
01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:45.430
Andrew Harshman: That felt really good.

1020
01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:54.000
Andrew Harshman: But… a game like Barony was, like, full of moments, exciting, fun, story moments like that.

1021
01:49:54.010 --> 01:50:08.700
Andrew Harshman: And for me personally, for a roguelike to be, really special, there needs to be an emerging story and excitement. And I did not come away from Spelunky with that many stories, aside from how,

1022
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:10.809
Andrew Harshman: Flummoxed and angered.

1023
01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:12.379
Andrew Harshman: I was by it.

1024
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:16.379
Andrew Harshman: But I'm gonna keep playing it, because some part of me finds it fun. I don't know.

1025
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.140
Scott Burger: Well, I'm going to jump up the rankings scale here, giving… and I…

1026
01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.370
Scott Burger: I was coming into this episode thinking, like, okay.

1027
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:41.140
Scott Burger: we're putting it on the schedule, I kind of have a little bit of an axe to grind of, like, oh, maybe Spelunky really isn't as good as I remember, or, like, maybe it's not as good as, like, people think it is. So I kind of came in, like, a little skeptical. I'm like, you know, it's kind of bullshit, I don't know. …

1028
01:50:41.190 --> 01:50:55.339
Scott Burger: like, I was playing the daily challenge, like, and I was looking forward to it, like, every day, because I wanted to see, A, could I beat Woody's high score? B, like, how far could I get? Like, could I do better than I was before? I was playing it very much with, like, this arcade mentality, …

1029
01:50:55.340 --> 01:51:01.919
Scott Burger: And it was really fun! So, for me, Spelunky's landing on my rankings at a 9.1,

1030
01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:13.679
Scott Burger: Just behind Inscription and just ahead of Vampire Survivors, in good company, because there's, like, a lot of other really titans of that genre up there. And I think it deserves to be. I think it's… it has…

1031
01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:25.280
Scott Burger: the legacy, I think it has the standing power, … I think it is, like… like we were talking about earlier, for, like, the scope and size of, like, what it is and what's in it, it just…

1032
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:44.620
Scott Burger: everything feels so complete, and I feel like there's nothing missing that wouldn't add just more cruft to it. Some bad things, just to nitpick it a little bit, these are all, like, little minor things, but, like, you can't pause mid-run. I guess, like, the Steam Deck kind of solves that, but, being, like, if you've got a really good run going, you're like, oh shit, I gotta go to work.

1033
01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:46.999
Woody: Oh, you mean you can't, like, exit and come.

1034
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.100
Scott Burger: Like, save and quit, yeah.

1035
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:52.130
Woody: I thought you meant, like, you can't, like, press start and pause the game.

1036
01:51:52.440 --> 01:52:00.019
Scott Burger: No, yeah, you… boy, I sure hope they had a pause button to Spelunky 2, wouldn't that be great? The learning curve… Well, it's an old game, Scott.

1037
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:11.669
Scott Burger: Learning curve, I think, is… is really steep. Sometimes it, … it, like, kind of skirts the line between, like, Nintendo hard and Nintendo bullshit sometimes. Sure. …

1038
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:29.870
Scott Burger: the… the shortcuts, I think, are an interesting system. We didn't really talk much about this, but, like, the shortcuts, like, you… when you end a level, you, like, you pay off the tunnel man in subsequent steps, like, I think it does a good job of teaching you how to progress through the game, …

1039
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:42.779
Scott Burger: I feel like if there was… so Noita has this, like, daily challenge mode of, like, it just puts you in a random part of the game with random equipment, go to town. And, like, I think that's a really great way of learning that really complicated game. I think if…

1040
01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:55.889
Scott Burger: Spelinky had something similar. Again, it's 5 years earlier, so it's hard to… hard to fault it, but I think that would help a lot with, like, okay, what about this situation? What are you gonna do? What about this one? Without having to go through the… the, …

1041
01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:16.070
Scott Burger: Rube Goldberg machine of death to get there. No cloud saves is kind of annoying, and having to play the tutorial again. This game looks awful on a 1440p monitor. It is a 720p game, it scales up, and again, you can't really fault it from 2012, but at the same time, like.

1042
01:53:16.530 --> 01:53:30.190
Scott Burger: it looks really, really good on the Steam Deck. If you're holding it at arm's length on a small screen, if you are, like, looking at it in all of its hideous glory on a 1440p monitor.

1043
01:53:30.190 --> 01:53:39.290
Scott Burger: a foot away from your face, you kind of start to see the wrinkles. But you know what? Wrinkles are fine. We're not out here to Botox everything to a smooth bowling ball finish.

1044
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:56.700
Scott Burger: Spelunky, it kicked off the roguelike Renaissance. We have all of the great games on this program that we've done, I think, owe it to Spelunky to kick open that door and start that. There's just enough branching paths to, like, keep gameplay fresh. …

1045
01:53:56.930 --> 01:54:12.629
Scott Burger: it's so smooth and precise, like, the ninja comment about, like, jumping around feeling like a ninja, 100%. And I think this is a… overall, a punishing but fair game. I often think sometimes if, like, if I opened up, like, a roguelike arcade, like, business.

1046
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:21.540
Scott Burger: This would be, like, the first thing you see when you walk in. This would be front and center, this… like, welcome to roguelikes. They're tough.

1047
01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:37.650
Scott Burger: They're hard, you're gonna dump a bunch of quarters, you're gonna dump a bunch of time into beating this game, but it's gonna be like that Battletoads moment of victory when you do so, and it's gonna be… feel real rewarding, and I think overall, it's still fun to revisit 10 plus years later. So for me, a 9.1.

1048
01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:40.540
Scott Burger: Now, Woody, … Is it?

1049
01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:46.690
Andrew Harshman: Is it, one of the definitive video games? We're about to find out. Woody?

1050
01:54:46.830 --> 01:55:03.900
Woody: Oh, yeah, I convinced… I mean, I kind of came in biased, yes. I think it is one of the definitive video games, I just think that, like, what you can… it's just so clear of, like, how much is accomplished with a little amount, and just, like…

1051
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:11.299
Woody: when I'm explaining board game rules to people, and I… you know, so many times I get into this scenario of, I'm like.

1052
01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:31.090
Woody: oh yeah, but one more thing, like, this… you can't do this, like, this rule kicks into gear, whereas Spelunky, there's that, you know, 2-minute tutorial with the big pictures that tells you what to do, and that basically gives you everything you need to understand the game. Even if there's, you know, a lot more depth beyond that.

1053
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:34.329
Woody: You don't need it to traverse the caves. …

1054
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:50.110
Woody: Well, so, I am not fully educated in this new rating system, but I feel like I can fit my rating into it, because Spelunky's a 10. Like, I don't know, like, I… if you're not gonna give Spelunky a 10, like, I don't know what you're saving your 10s for,

1055
01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:51.160
Colin: fire.

1056
01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:51.780
Woody: Yeah.

1057
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.720
Colin: Gotta make sure we mention that at least once per episode.

1058
01:55:53.720 --> 01:56:11.629
Woody: Yeah. Sure, I mean, all those games tends, too. Based, you know, I… as I said, I'm fortunate to only be on this podcast when I want to, meaning I only have to play games that I really like, or at least have some sort of vested interest in, and so…

1059
01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:18.810
Woody: I love Spelunky, I… I love it ever so slightly less than Enter the Gungeon, because it doesn't have….

1060
01:56:19.150 --> 01:56:24.370
Andrew Harshman: My man! Yes, yes, yes. Dungeon still hangs on, it doesn't have… always.

1061
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:30.910
Woody: that same goofy, totally goofy sense of humor. It just… you know, even though we were kind of…

1062
01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:38.190
Woody: calling out games that add 500 new weapons or whatever as a way to fill content, like, I like all the 500 weapons and guns.

1063
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:41.389
Andrew Harshman: Yeah, I mean, it's only bad if you do it wrong. Yeah.

1064
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.730
Woody: Exactly.

1065
01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:45.919
Andrew Harshman: And, you know, it ain't easy, but, you know, the Gungeon does it.

1066
01:56:45.920 --> 01:57:00.070
Woody: Yep, and so… Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, no, you're good. Spelunky is a game I just… I just love playing, and I'm always so, so impressed by how well put together it is. …

1067
01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:11.820
Woody: Yeah, and just in this time of revisiting it after I had gone through what I thought was the end of my spelunky phase many years ago, I'm just reminded of, like, oh yeah, this is one of my favorite games of all time.

1068
01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:15.209
Woody: So… Thanks for letting me talk about it.

1069
01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:23.070
Scott Burger: Yeah, … similar… Thank you for coming on! Yeah, thank you again for coming back for all the good games, ….

1070
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:24.989
Woody: Similar games, Spelunky 2.

1071
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:43.879
Scott Burger: Yeah, that is the first one that I have on there. Spelunky 2, clearly, there is, one that, like, if you thought Spelunky was fun, but you wanted more traditional roguelike mechanics in there, and more difficulty, then, the game Vagante is right up your alley, for being punishing….

1072
01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:44.720
Woody: Dante.

1073
01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:47.920
Scott Burger: V-a-g-a-n-t-e.

1074
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:49.310
Woody: Okay.

1075
01:57:49.480 --> 01:58:05.640
Scott Burger: Woody furiously taking notes of more difficult games to beat, of course. There is, a game by, Caseware on Steam. A lot of his games look very similar. This is a guy that did Bone Razor Minions, but he also made, Spirit's Abyss.

1076
01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:25.440
Scott Burger: which has, like, this really good, chunky, like, dark, Halloween-vibed… it's like a Halloween-vibed Spelunky, almost. Which is quite fun, maybe not as punishing as Spelunky. There's another game that's, maybe like Spelunky in reverse, where instead of going down, you're going up, called Tower Climb?

1077
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.849
Scott Burger: Not, … not, ….

1078
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:29.300
Woody: Not Tower Fall.

1079
01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:47.129
Scott Burger: Not Tower Fall, Tower Climb! But, is filled with all sorts of, like, those kind of simulationist, weird, deep game mechanics, and flies under a lot of people's radar. Other games that are kind of, like, similar cave spelunking dungeon games, Catacomb Kids…

1080
01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:58.840
Scott Burger: People like a lot. Cave Blazers, people like a lot. There's one that has really good pixel art called Dun Greed. And of course, we have to mention Noita again, because I feel like…

1081
01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:04.100
Scott Burger: all the stuff that I like about Spelunky, for me, personally, I think Noita does better.

1082
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:04.790
Woody: Wow!

1083
01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.310
Woody: Like… Okay, adding Noita to my wish list.

1084
01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.619
Colin: You haven't played Noida?

1085
01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.909
Scott Burger: No. Oh, what you have?

1086
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:14.940
Colin: to play Noida. It's absolutely up to.

1087
01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:16.789
Andrew Harshman: You must, simply must.

1088
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.180
Scott Burger: Yeah, Noita, I feel like, is….

1089
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.699
Colin: You're gonna like it.

1090
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:22.540
Scott Burger: Yeah.

1091
01:59:22.730 --> 01:59:38.830
Scott Burger: Listen to our Noita episode, previous episode, of where to go to get those workshop mods for making your starting wand home in on dudes to make it a lot easier. Yeah, check, check some of those out. Well, that's… that'll wind down our…

1092
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:51.490
Scott Burger: 75th, Big 7-5, I don't know what wedding anniversary, reward that one is, but, episode, and listener request episode. And if you want to request more stuff,

1093
01:59:51.490 --> 01:59:55.740
Andrew Harshman: I'm pretty sure it's the, … Golden head helmet.

1094
01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:56.790
Woody: Yes.

1095
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:59.399
Andrew Harshman: 75th anniversary, if I'm not mistaken.

1096
01:59:59.400 --> 01:59:59.810
Scott Burger: That's.

1097
01:59:59.810 --> 02:00:03.520
Andrew Harshman: You're beloved. Yeah, thanks for tuning in! I'm sorry.

1098
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.830
Scott Burger: And what else we got? Send your golden head helmet stories.

1099
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:07.160
Andrew Harshman: into….

1100
02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:21.130
Scott Burger: grogplodZone at gmail.com. Our mastodon is GrogPod, I gave him a tough place. Technically we're on Blue Sky, although I didn't put it on there. Something at Grog… it's one of those weird, like, mirror things. …

1101
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:39.070
Scott Burger: But yeah, I think everything that I post on Mastodon just automatically gets mirrored there. GrogPod.zone has all the official, unequivocal, unarguable ratings, and all the other nonsense stuff, the website. Go check that out. But that's gonna do it for a very brutal, hard…

1102
02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:47.400
Scott Burger: titular game of… of Splunky, so I thank, I thank everyone for, being brutalized,

1103
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:49.229
Scott Burger: As a warm-up.

1104
02:00:49.710 --> 02:00:59.960
Scott Burger: to be brutalized for our next episode, where… I had this one on the schedule a long time ago, and I thought, you know what, it just needs more time to bake, needs more time for me to understand and grok it.

1105
02:01:00.590 --> 02:01:12.659
Scott Burger: I think I grok it now, and it will be fun and interesting to get our Ungabungas in a row, and, smash some giant, dragons and demons

1106
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:28.419
Scott Burger: Because next episode, we are playing possibly the, well, up to this point this year, the biggest roguelike, or roguelite, depending on how you define it, game released in 2025 thus far, as of August. Slay the Spire 2 is gonna come out tomorrow, as soon as I say this.

1107
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:31.400
Scott Burger: I am picking Elden Ring Night Rain.

1108
02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.070
Scott Burger: For us to play.

1109
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.000
Scott Burger: And it is gonna be….

1110
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:35.640
Andrew Harshman: eBay.

1111
02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:45.559
Scott Burger: It is gonna be some jolly cooperation, it is gonna be some… some wild nonsense, a lot of… lot of dodge rolling, lots of, …

1112
02:01:45.700 --> 02:02:05.169
Scott Burger: protecting of the flock, and yeah, continuing the maximum level of roguelike brutality by getting good! And, and, you know, as you see in standard Elden Ring a lot, some messages saying, at last, dot dot dot, fort, dot dot dot, night.

1113
02:02:08.710 --> 02:02:26.949
Scott Burger: But that's gonna, yeah, that's gonna wind down our Spelunky episode. Elden Ring Night Ring coming up next. Very excited for that one. But to play us out from here, will be, some jammin' tunes for you to hold down that sprint button, and ready your shotgun as you prepare to fight Anubis in the final temple before the end.

1114
02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:28.320
Scott Burger: Or is it?
