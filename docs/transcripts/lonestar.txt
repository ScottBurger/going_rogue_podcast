Hello and welcome to another episode of the Grog Pod Rogue Like podcast where each episode we blast off across the universe hunting small, medium, and big boss rogue like bounties and then throw them into rogue like prison at the end of the year and have them fight fight for prison supremacy in our rogue like game playoffs that we revisit at the end of each season of our podcast.
1:01
I am your pet cat piloting A Starship host.
Scott Berger, and on the Galaxy's Most Wanted list this week are my Co host.
Oh, I didn't even think of a special name.
I am a goofy some kind of spaceship with some swapping thing.
1:16
Oh, this is terrible.
This is Will.
That's who this is.
And it's me, Colin, the pilot of a giant crab Mecca ship that's gonna cut Andrew in half.
And rounding out our rogues gallery is It's Me, Andrew Real, Folks, Blues Harshman.
1:32
Yes, this week we are playing cool math games in space with Lone Star released in Early Access pretty recently January 18th 2024.
Currently only on PC, but per the the developer Discord recently saying that they are thinking about bringing it to the Switch in the near future.
1:56
Developed by Math Tide Games and published by Beijing based Thermite Games who are known for other games such as a life SIM called Nobody The Turn Around, a point and click game called Tales of the Neon Sea and a visual novel called Far Away.
2:14
Your average player of this game has about 20 hours in it, which is a pretty respectable chunk of time for a pretty recently released Early Access game, and this cranks in on our popularity charts at the 533rd most popular Rogue LED game with 1001 total reviews.
2:35
Colin, you have one sentence of energy cards left to describe what one does in Lone Star.
Put up to 9 units on a ship, make 3 lasers, go out, kill enemy, Boom.
I mean, that was fine, yeah.
One sentence.
2:50
What happened?
See, I actually followed the prompt.
Only one sentence, unlike man, I think.
Those were actually a bunch of independent clauses.
We could say that you had a big old, you know, sentence place or commas place in the middle of there.
If you very well, I mean it's a it is not really a deck builder.
3:07
I would say it's close to a deck builder.
You do have a deck of energy cards that kind of get shuffled together and drawn ish and you're you're building your little ship in in various combinations and then you are facing off in a showdown with another ship bounty hunter style and you got three lanes of lasers and you got to beat the the ship on the lasers.
3:33
Then you blow it up, and so your goal is to have a higher number in three spots than the other ship, or maybe 2-2 spots if you're you're moving around, but that.
That's that's if you want to have a higher number in some cases.
I mean, mostly you do.
3:49
As far as I can tell.
I beat it.
I beat it a couple times.
I'm gonna say you generally are going for bigger number.
Well, I was.
I was kind of taken aback because when Will suggested this game for us to play, he he threw down a gauntlet and proposed a challenge to us.
4:07
That in he listed a bounty, if you will.
Oh yeah, there was a target.
There was a a wanted poster put up for this game saying that.
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe your first two runs in this game, you won both of them.
4:24
Is that right?
I've never lost.
You've never you've never lost a run in this game.
Yeah man, I only realized that there was the retreat option.
I've only used the retreat option like in one game, and I use it like, I think four times that game.
But like essentially I've.
Only used the retreat like 2 times.
4:41
I mean six out of seven or seven out of eight.
What?
What?
What are you saying to me?
What's going on?
These are all just slaps in the face that you're you requested this lap in the face and here we are.
And let me, and let me, and Colin, you also beat your first round, Is that correct?
4:59
I think I beat my first four in a row.
Your first four.
Yeah, now, now to be clear.
And I lost on a on a weird fluke on the first boss on that fifth one.
And to be clear, when you're talking about like winning, you're talking about winning like the full, like three act structure of of the whole run, right?
5:21
OK.
And at once I asked the five bosses at the very end, you're just like, yeah, I'm having, I got, I got a good build.
Let's just roll through 5 consecutive bosses back and you're just like yeah, that was easy.
Do they wait?
I can't remember.
Do they?
If you're doing the five boss thing, do they?
Do you get fresh health each time?
No, you just.
5:36
Go through What is the?
Five boss thing.
What are you talking about?
When you win.
When you win if.
You win.
Someday you'll you'll.
Get well.
To be clear, both Scott and I eventually got a victory screen.
The Legend screen there and then.
5:54
Apparently if one ever wanted to play more of this game, there would be.
There's an option to then do some kind of five boss gauntlet.
Yeah, you start with full health and I guess you, you fight five bosses in a row on the same health pool, which I wasn't sure because I wow.
6:11
I mean, I don't think.
It sounds like a heck of a good time, boy.
All right, well, that is very surprising to hear, but I commend Y'all's ability to learn.
Grok a new game and seemingly master it in your first, not just first run, but second run, and then sometimes four run.
6:29
Interesting.
But, Scott, you had a greater point, perhaps that yes, there was a gauntlet.
We've gone over how we did I I did not claim the bounty.
Scott did not claim the bounty, but Colin did.
Four times over.
Wild.
Which, like when I heard.
6:46
When I heard like, OK, Will won his first two runs in it, I thought, Oh well, that makes sense because you you fire up this game and you you're plopped down into AI.
Think a pretty OK tutorial.
7:01
There's a lot of stuff going on here, but like going through this tutorial, I have a a note in my Google doc.
It's like.
This game is.
So easy.
No wonder Will got two victories in a row.
And then I realized, oh there's oh oh there's much more to this.
7:22
I thought, well when you were talking about you got two victories in a row, I thought you meant that you had beaten 2 bosses in a row in a single run.
And I'm like, well yeah, of course that's that's so easy.
And then getting getting rolled in the in the third act of this game, I thought Oh yeah, well, well clearly everyone else must have.
7:39
But I I think Will and Colin must have Bellatro brain going on right now where you're just able to see all the combinatorics, you're able to see all of the probabilities in math equations lining up.
And I didn't get my first victory until just this morning playing on the bus.
So I've I kind of eked it in at the 11th hour.
7:56
Congratulations.
Good on ya I I too similarly was pretty late my one and only and last time I've I.
Will say that.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead, Will.
Yeah, I'm.
I'm going to go ahead and say that it's because I'm a you know slave aspire aficionado here and there's a lot of I think carry over with the mechanics or at least the the type of thinking when you're like Oh well how useful will this sort of thing be when you consider like you know each each like weapon or support thing is going to have like some kind of synergy and you can kind of just look at its description and be like well is this likely to be like a very strong synergy or is it like or not.
8:34
And in most cases unfortunately with this game it's just the rarity it's essentially like almost more important than the synergy stuff.
And so if you just get the the rare and the legendaries like that's pretty much I mean you you you wouldn't want to have no synergies, but I think that the the just having more rare stuff is generally the what leads to better outcomes.
8:55
And I you know I I believe it that the two of you have been have put in your reps you are you have have a level of mastery of this type of game and these sorts of mechanics that I do not have at all.
9:12
I will remind everyone Bellatro was the first like deck builder game I really properly played.
I was just checking slay the Spire stats and you have one minute.
Well, how many hours do you have in Sleigh the Spire?
20 minutes.
I'm actually ashamed.
I haven't actually played in like I think two months now 'cause there's Bellatro and then I've just been doing other things lately.
9:34
But let's see here, this sleigh, the Spire looks like, Where's that Here?
Oh, here it is almost 1000 hours, which is actually I think I thought I was expecting more.
Or if you include Downfall, then we're probably getting up to about 1400 hours.
And and once again, I commend you, but I wanna go back to what you were saying at the beginning.
9:52
You said it's a matter of reading the description and turn and finding out like if it's gonna be a good synergy, if it's gonna be good.
Let me stop you early there.
Just.
Reading the description, that's the greatest challenge that this game offers at at every turn.
10:08
The verbiage, the localization, the the UI design is seemingly actively trying to subvert and obfuscate and do every bit of skullduggery to mislead you There is there is an issue with the terminology in this game.
10:31
I think we can all agree, I think we may, but you know, obviously we have different opinions on how big of an issue this is.
But yeah, just read the description.
Easier said than done and I will.
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll give the devs maybe a little bit of credit because they're they're probably writing the descriptions and then translating it to English.
10:53
And I think for the most part they've done like a pretty bang up job.
But I think like, it's not so much in like the translation as it is like there's certain types of of like tabletop games or like European board games that get like excessively complicated.
11:11
And there there's like there's words that mean very similar things.
And it's like you see this all the time in in games like the, the.
Literal word, the term that they're.
Using.
In his existing real word, real world word.
Right.
And like no matter, like if it was English, if it was French, if it was Italian, it doesn't really matter.
11:28
But like, you know, you have like 2 words that kind of mean roughly the same thing, but like their application is pretty different.
It's thematically similar, but it's like it's like a thing where it's like really hard to figure out well how does this thing work based on the text, But once you see it in action, you're like, OK, I think I get it now the I think, yeah.
11:50
And I think there's maybe like a problem with there being a lot of text and to some degree like there's like there's like some like tutorial in game wiki stuff that like tells you like, hey this is how this thing is working, which is pretty good.
12:08
But I think I I think I need that on like a BI unit.
Basis almost like a into the breach sort of like as you I mean like explicit like instructions for what this thing will do when you get it and not just in its current form.
I mean it does give you the upgraded form description but like something that's more detailed about what's going to happen when you do this.
12:29
And and I just I just scrolled up through our chat because I I was the first to like it.
I think this is on the 8th.
Today's the you know 21st when we're recording this and it looks like the I'm saying the fuck does this mean?
And I and it's like I took a screenshot of something that says you know the options, three options, copy, copy one unit and then and the next one is enhancement Copy the lowest graded slot of one unit.
12:52
And I'm.
Just like what?
What is a slot?
Is that a like, is that a unit?
Oh, and then I realized, you know, just in like like thinking about it and just being like process of elimination of what that could be is, oh, this is the energy slot.
And so the lowest graded one would be like if you have whites, blue and orange or then it'd be whites and if you had blue and orange, then it would be blue.
13:12
And it's just like, OK, so this is all like legal speak almost.
You have to be like a lawyer and be like, OK, well let's just think about this in terms of its contractual value.
I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with you on speaker speak.
It's like a weird circuit board where they put instructions on it and you can figure it out if you follow the circuitry and you're like, OK, logically this must be a resistor because that's the way that a circuit would work and you have to in some ways disregard many of the the way that it's phrased.
13:43
You're like, this makes me think it would do this but that doesn't make sense.
And I'm, you know, I'm hovering my little energy over this unit and the number isn't going up the way I thought, let's let's puzzle.
Like the first puzzle is how to beat the game and get the bigger number.
13:59
But the the second or maybe the zeroth puzzle is to figure out how each unit works so that you can figure out how to then use it in a synergy.
Because this game is you mean.
Well.
Saying that you don't like hunting for synergies isn't the best way to do it, but you do end up with synergies almost regardless.
14:21
And if you know if you have a choice between one very powerful unit and one other very powerful unit, one of them is going to almost certainly be better for your build.
And if you can't figure out which one that is, you will just lose.
And especially if you make a mistake when you're loading your energies into your thing.
14:39
So like you have all of these units, you have a hand of energies of one through 9 and different colors you put them in to to activate your your laser powers or whatever.
If you do them in the wrong order, you can absolutely screw yourself the order.
14:56
Especially with like how the various abilities proc is like every every turn is a chess puzzle in in some ways to like figure out how you want to like.
There is almost certainly a correct sequence to to to load your things for the optimal output.
And just like to to expand on that, it's just like, it's not only is it like if you have a, you know, you have a certain number of energies in the beginning and you're starting the game at, well, you have to like, memorize what every single thing the enemy's like units do, 'cause they all have long descriptions about this will trigger when this happens.
15:27
And when this happens, it moves down here.
And then you have to like, look above at all of the air.
I'm going to call them relics.
I don't remember what they're called in the game.
But like treasures, yeah, treasuries, they they work the same as latest by Relics and you have to memorize all of those things too.
Which is to say like if you want to save a game and come back into it, you have to spend a good 5 minutes.
15:46
Just like, yeah, you can't.
I would say don't do that.
Just don't do that because you come back and you're like, OK, what's going on here.
So I I generate another energy after the 10th energy I've generated.
But then unless this happens and and it's just like you can only keep so much in like active memory and like the the chess puzzle gets I'd say into like you know it's it's you know these are 2000 rated puzzles when you think about like the.
16:09
Level of complexity.
That you have to put into some of the decisions and like the level of foresight of like OK this is the the absolute perfect path.
And the perfect example of this is in that one game I remember the the final boss, I ended up retreating 4 times, but it was one where it's just like, OK, well, I learned that, like, exactly how the enemy's mechanics work, But, like, there's one narrow path to victory and you had to play it in exactly the right order, else you just couldn't do it.
16:40
And it took me that many times to be like, OK, in fact, I can sacrifice this.
If I move my ship down here and avoid this one, I'll take a lot of damage, but that's OK, 'cause on the next turn I'll be able to do this.
And it's just like it's a it's a whole thing.
You gotta work the whole puzzle out before your first move.
Well before your first move, before your tutorial, before you do anything in this game, you boot it up and you are greeted with the mouth harp of the century with a a a Blues bar that got Will to say that this was.
17:13
Is this still accurate, the best soundtrack to a game that we've played on this podcast?
I.
Believe the exact quote was the rudeness tooteness soundtrack.
Is that?
Isn't that right, Will?
That doesn't sound like me, but the sentiment does sound like what I was getting across.
Did I say rudeness?
Studentness.
No, I'm I'm making that.
17:29
OK, yeah.
I mean like, I mean as a harmonical.
Play myself exact quote was Lone Star music equals equals.
Best of all games so far BTW.
There you.
Go it is quite good and and you know a main menu theme is super important.
17:44
I think we've we have learned, we we maybe already knew, but we also have learned on this podcast that like you're going to hear that a lot.
You're going to hear it on repeat and and like you know, oh boy you know it's it's it's you're in a tough spot if you've got a game where you alt tab out of it and you're walking around listening to it and it doesn't have a good, a good song but this, yeah, it's it's it's good stuff.
18:06
What specifically do you like about it Will?
That that whole space cowboy thing, I mean, even though that's kind of like done, I won't say to death, but it's been done in many big, you know, Cowboy Bebop comes to mind right away.
The Smokey Dokey from that is like one of the biggest that that's got that basically started a whole generation of harmonica players with that particular tune and so like this has a very similar vibe to that.
18:31
But you can think about it like Rimworld has a very similar theme too.
I think there's, in fact I was almost, I was almost convinced at one point.
There's a transition with like a little guitar rift that like sounds almost like it is exactly from Rimworld.
And they may have taken that or like did a very small modification on something that Rimworld did.
18:49
But it's like it's very similar there.
And I I just, I like that style.
There's something about that.
That it's very, you know, it's warm, it's very human.
It's reminds me of maybe of Firefly a little bit.
You know, there's something about that sort of that that cowboy space adventure, you know, especially with, you know, collecting bounties and that sort of thing.
19:11
It just works for me and all.
Yeah.
Again, also because I literally have a harmonica here all the time.
I don't carry one with me these days, but I just play, you know, pretty frequently.
It's it's one of those things that really catches my ear.
Now it's interesting that the like you're you're greeted with such a a space western aesthetic like from an auditory perspective and I guess like you kind of get a little bit of that vibe through like your non combat events a little bit.
19:43
Was that was that everyone else's experience?
Like like how would how would we describe the lore of this world?
I don't know.
I'm at a.
Level with y'all.
I don't think I read those event descriptions.
I I read I I read like a handful of them but they're it was kind of I don't I I try not to do this with games but it was kind of happening sort of naturally where I'm just like yeah, yeah, whatever.
20:08
What's the mechanic what what are my choices mechanically.
So I I don't know.
You tell me.
Well yeah I mean like your your two things that you do in this game where you are you you're laser ship fighting and you're reading event descriptions because and I think actually like this is, this is an interesting way to mix it up because like to come back to FTL, right you know you're you're going from like node to node across the map and oh is this a combat encounter or is this like some sort of text based event with a a gambling mechanic tied to it or whatever.
20:46
Lone Star does it interesting because you have like it's almost like a like a sonar plot and you have events that are like a certain unit distance away and you have to kind of rationalize like, well, I have, I got 7 vacation days here.
21:02
I've been banking up the PTO for bounty hunting and I've got to figure out whether to use my 4 vacation days on this this red event that's further out or this Gray event that's closer in or maybe a a blue event that's also closer in.
21:23
You know the you might have better options with one or the other and then you you pick on one and you know you are you're rolling into the space Bounty hunter saloon and you're plopping down to play presumably.
I think this game Lone Star is titled after some in game card game named Lone Star, possibly in a similar vein to like Gwent or something.
21:47
I I think I had a similar, a similar kind of aspect where I'm like oh this is kind of interesting And then like the more that I was reading my eyes just kind of like glazed over.
I'm like, you know, it's late.
I just did a big workout.
My mom's calling you.
But I do like.
22:04
I do like, I think the the writing for how much text there is.
I think there's a lot of flavor and effort put into the writing and and there's not as much like legal game mechanic lawyerisms going on.
It's much more straightforward.
22:20
It's like you strolling to the robot.
Machinist.
Shop and.
Clear and and I mean there are a couple times where the the the options that you get at the end aren't exactly clear but I think for the most part once you understand the mechanics of the game they're fairly clear and I and I think they're often times somewhat interesting choices like I'm I'm gonna compare it to Slave Aspire.
22:45
Usually Slave Aspire is pretty like they're very straightforward.
It's like get a card, get rid of a card, get some more health or whatever.
Like, there's definitely some of them that are in this game that are, you know, sacrifice something to get something else or the chance of something else.
23:01
And I I I thought that they were good.
I liked the upgrades that they offered in the in the vacation days.
I wish they'd called them like relaxation days or something.
Like I don't.
I don't imagine Cowboys going on vacation.
Imagine them like tendon the farm or something but I'm I'll let that, I'll let that slide.
23:19
Like saloon days or something.
Yeah, I feel like.
I feel like there's there's.
A rustling days.
Oh, rustling.
And because this game, you know, is in Early Access, I expect, you know, there's there's gonna be changes to lots of stuff that we're complaining about.
But I feel like there is, there's an element with this event exploration aspect to to just have like more stuff in here because I feel like all the events are things that like they're well done, but they're things roughly that we've kind of seen before, right?
23:50
You know, you have something that's like your deck milling option, your option for upgrading the units like, yeah, OK, I understand how all these work.
We've seen these before.
It's it's a tried and true formula that works but like the the combat stuff is so is so new and unique that I'm I'm and this is something that I'm sure they'll they'll they'll get out before one point O releasing.
24:16
But like, I'm almost expecting like combat encounters to happen.
You know how like an FTL, you know you have and maybe the maybe I'm almost painting myself in a corner of like, you know, it would be great to have all these new unique novel things.
And by the way, FTL did blah blah blah blah blah so.
24:35
I like the new unique stuff, but actually do it like the old stuff.
Well, I mean there's I feel like there's a very thematic thing you could do where, you know you stroll into a a, a saloon to play the Lone Star game and you're so maybe like a push your luck thing, you push your luck too far and oops, that triggers a combat encounter kind of a thing like draw, draw across the table.
24:55
You had five aces kind of a thing.
I feel like there's there's also more of that cowboy Wild West space or like the space cowboy lore that's like, it's established like the first thing that you see, but it's kind of sprinkled in through the rest of the game.
25:13
And I feel like I've like, give me more of that.
I want to see more like space robots wearing wearing dusters and with the sawed off shotguns kind of thing.
I am I'm I'm nodding along.
I could definitely go for more of that for sure and in a one point O release I would, I would say you know it's probably not a stretch to imagine that there might be some artwork to go with these vacation and the and and the idea of you know, there being different triggers for combat is is certainly neat, definitely.
25:47
Good.
Or even just like with with just regards to FTL and like A, A mechanic I think about frequently these days is to have kind of like a reoccurring characters or something where act one something happens which sets a kind of a mini mission where there's a probability of certain events happening later that's increased or decreased by you know the consequence of that.
26:09
And then you have another decision later on.
And so you have like a sort of a, you know, a continuity around some kind of a micro mission and I know FTL did that really well.
And as I'm thinking about other games like it seems like having this sort of, I don't know if we want to have a meta progression where you're like with one character 'cause he's runs all seem very much encapsulated within, like the the run is like that's the game.
26:35
It's not like there's nothing outside of that that really pulls you back in like a Haiti style thing, but just to have those little micro missions might.
Offer some variety and spice.
You know what we're missing between So like what There's a spectrum here for Rogue like sci-fi bounty hunter games on one far end that's a very story.
26:57
Entrenched long possibly more of an RPG with Rogi elements in it is Grifflands.
And on the farther end of the spectrum that is very more of like individually run based but less less with like like the over like the the domination of the art style is Lone Star.
27:20
And I feel like if Lone Star came like three or four steps closer to like the the visual presentation that Grifland has.
And maybe with some of like those those kind of systems that you're talking about, like oh, you know, you're you go to one event like, oh, you're given some task to to come back later or like doing something raises or lowers your reputation with like other factions that you're hunting bounties for.
27:51
Like maybe we're trying to shoehorn too much into a game that's like relatively straightforward.
But I feel like there's there's like that kind of stuff that would work really well here that I can only I'm like crossing my fingers like I I hope there's like some more stuff like that.
28:07
Yeah.
Like you go into the the vacation day events and you see the big wall of text and then your ship is just kind of on the left, like floating there.
It would be cool if there was like slay the Spire style style, like splash art of like, you know show me like the, the, the like what's happening in the universe.
28:24
Like there's.
Show me the robot, the.
Character.
I wanna see the characters.
Characters, yeah.
Then at least I don't have to necessarily look at the text.
This is going to sound like I'm real dumb.
I'll have to look at the text.
I can just look at the picture.
Well, I mean, yeah, there's something to be said with like the the story being telled with some kind of visual, visual presentation in addition to the text.
28:46
We're all losing our intelligence here.
It was tell.
He was talking about Telltale Games.
And that.
What a great story.
They make well.
So an adjacent topic related what I look for in a really good rogue like is and and what I think all great rogue likes have to some extent story narrative that narrative NDK.
29:10
But like there was a fun story and flow and plot that came out of your playthrough because all of these sort of you know random Rogi elements came up, rolled out and and played out in an interesting unique way.
And it's fun to get to the end of a run of a rogue like and be like Oh yeah, you know FTL is like the best example.
29:30
It's like, you know, I started with this group and you know, there was, there was Sally and there was Becks and there was, you know, Ray J from the Rock planet or the Fire planet or something.
And they had to deal with XYZ events.
And then, oh, I got really put into a tough spot when you know, all of my, you know, most of my main systems were destroyed and so I had to gamble on this one, you know, sort of far off, you know, treasure event and it lucked out and blah, blah, blah with this game.
29:58
I mean, how would you summarize the story of of your run?
It's a puzzle game.
It's a yeah, there's.
Really not a There's really not much of A story there.
There's not it really it's there are 12 or there's three bosses in in three acts in quotes where they each have two underlings, 1 elite and then the boss.
30:23
And as far as I can tell, there's really no theme correlation between all of them.
It's it's it's pretty much 12 individual showdowns, which kind of does fit the theme but it does mean that you don't have as much tying all the all the bits together, which is unfortunate.
30:45
I do want to call out though, my favorite, my favorite ship battle that you fight.
And I think the one that is the best for theme is the the one.
He's like one draw McGraw or something.
He's the one who makes you draw.
Like at the start of the battle it's like draw instead of drawing 4 energy, you drop 10 and it's just like quick draw.
31:07
We're going to do it all.
Right in the first.
Turn and he has like I think one hit point or something.
So it's just like he he's like we're going to go in one round and we're either you're either going to beat me or not.
And I'm like, that's actually feels like it fits the theme of the game more than most of the fights.
31:26
But you're just kind of like, oh, that's a crab robot.
Like, OK, cool.
I guess I don't know what a crab has to do with the the space western, but like, that's fun.
Yeah, I feel like there's there's, there's definitely, like, I do like generally the themes of the enemy ships that you're fighting.
31:46
Like there's one that was putting mines on my empty slots of my ship where I was like, Oh my God, now I gotta like puzzle through which of those do I want to deactivate?
But like, I had a good synergy going of like, well, I do want to take damage because I had this thing that every time I took shield damage, it was increased power for other things.
32:05
But anyway, between like that guy, I actually kind of like the Scorpion, the Space Scorpion for how like.
I did too.
I I actually, I thought it was fun.
I mean, I don't know what it how it fits in the theme, but it's still fun.
But yeah, I feel like there's there's, yeah, because you do fight three or four ships three times basically.
32:28
It would be interesting that like you know in this group of four that's like the the Green faction or you fight the Purple faction or some they have some kind of like theme that ties them together that maybe there's pirates or I don't know.
But it there, it, yeah, it feels like.
32:44
You know, they have like a similar mechanic like, oh, the first one has a mine.
And then you're like, OK, I'm gonna have three or three or four turns to figure out how to, like, build up my resistance to this strategy.
Yeah, yeah.
32:59
I feel like there is there is more to kind of flesh out in in that aspect and also with like in terms of like bounty hunting, there doesn't really seem to be a whole lot of like negotiation going on.
Well that's a great point.
That's a that's a missed opportunity for like you know and that and that would you know speak to the sort of you know, interesting decision making that we in games.
33:20
But if there were decisions as to like which bounty am I going to pursue at what time definitely that would be that would be good 'cause yeah, as it is the structure of the combats is pretty rich.
Like you're gonna have these fights and they are automatically gonna happen.
I don't know.
33:35
For me, it felt it.
It didn't, It didn't feel very Roguy.
And that, you know, when I would do a run, it didn't feel like much of a run.
It didn't feel like there's any kind of, like, you know, openness.
It was just like I need to.
I will be presented with challenges and I need to, you know, withstand them.
33:51
Basically, yeah.
I mean, the rogueness comes almost exclusively from variability in item and treasure drops.
That is, that is the entire.
Which which is important in these games.
But like for that to be the only rogi element is unfortunate And I'm sure you know there's there's a lot of time for them to you know expand this game and make and make lots of stuff.
34:12
But at this point the core, the core game play the ship combat is for me very is good once you get through just a God awful learning curve.
Let's let's talk a little bit more about that core combat and what is probably the highlight of the game.
34:32
I have a question for everyone.
So there's there's certain elements, well you were talking about it most recently Scott, about how this game offers a lot of fresh new ID and specifically this like this three lane structure was very new and interesting to me and I I've never seen it anywhere else.
34:54
Have have you all seen anything similar?
Nope.
It's just a way of, from my point of view, of combining attack and defense into a single number.
Yeah, and I think it's I I feel like I've seen something like, it's close but not really.
But yeah, it's it's it's interesting that it's instead of being split into attack and defense, it's split into attack defense, but in three different parts.
35:17
In a way, Griftlands is kind of similar, but you have like friendly, friendly units instead of we're just talking about verbiage instead of spaceship guns in lanes.
35:33
You know you have like your your, your friendly bounty hunter associate in like the top part of your screen in Grifflands.
You have your player character in the center and then maybe like you know like a a a dog or someone like helping you out on the bottom lane.
35:48
Like that's that's the closest I can think of that that kind of matches up.
But yeah, it's not monster train.
Monster Jam, that's another scale like it's it's definitely not the same because there's a lot more going on and there's not there in Monster Training.
36:03
They're they're moving up the three levels and then there's just your health pool at the end, which is a pretty different thing than you have to manage the attack values in all three at all points.
Right, right.
But, but generally it's yeah.
But it's pretty.
36:19
Pretty fresh and pretty unique.
And I think what really makes it all that much better is that like thematically this is such a great choice because you have like the two ships facing off.
They are literally like the visuals are very, very nice and appealing to me.
36:35
The visuals, like, you know, once you've made your decisions and you say, all right, fire, fire the weapons, you know, both ships acquire these big beams of energy at each other, these three beams and they collide in space and they kind of push back and forth.
Very anime, very, very animated.
36:51
And it's while it may not be a 100% original concept, let's call it maybe like an 80% original.
It it like fits and works so well here and is pretty, pretty Dang good, pretty exciting, pretty cool.
So another dope thing that would be would be fun would be like some sort of like text pop up like when you're about to fire something that pops up like and then you both fire your stuff at the same time.
37:17
I I definitely like unironically said fire everything while I was playing this quite a few times quite a few Times Now like the whole something something that did come to mind with the the unit system.
So I think we we're brushed on this for a moment.
37:33
Your ship or at least the base ship.
I I never used anything but the has nine slots.
Imagine.
Imagine the D&D alignment chart, if you will, except.
Each.
Spot is a open slot for you to slot in a unit and every unit does something.
There's A tag unit.
37:48
Well, there's obviously typical, but anyway, there's A tag unit and there's support units in it and it's like you're you're building your ship, which is, which is also thematically fun that you would be building it.
And what I kept thinking of, Hey, you board game fans out here, Scott, I'm sure you thought of a Galaxy.
Trucker Hey, Yep, it's in my Notes Galaxy Trucker and to some extent, Eclipse.
38:11
I'm sure Nerds and I I I was amused.
I was delighted to see that a similar interface.
I'm sure they didn't.
What and what great inspiration it is.
Because yeah, of course if you're going out into space and rogue, like, one would expect that you're going to get to modify and customize your ship.
38:31
Now calling them units I think was a terrible idea, but again, maybe they could fix that before.
When I feel like that's AI mean it's not great, but it's the least of their sins against the English language.
Yeah, I think that for for for me the greatest of their sins was saying your enemy on the enemy ship to mean you.
38:55
Which is just mind bogglingly confusing, I mean.
Right away.
You guys are just like, yeah, no, oh.
No, no, I read out of four enemies, it's.
Module.
But the enemy of my enemy, I'm me.
Yes.
39:11
I figured it out but it just every time I read it I had to pause, like unscramble it and then be like OK now I understand but it it it added like 3 seconds to every time I had to read one of the descriptions.
Indeed.
So the three out of four of us thought it was not a trivial issue.
39:31
Correct.
Answer is literally, we were discussing it on Discord.
Scott brought it up.
And then I'm like, well, I understand.
I think I got it now.
And then I go back to my game.
I'll tie back to my game and immediately make the same mistake.
And I was like, Oh my gosh, I thought I understood it and it was just explained to me.
39:47
Yeah, I think like the one of the base ship attack units that you start with also has a.
It has two grace or white slots on it where if you feed it in energy of the same point value, you get like you get a bonus from that.
40:10
But I don't know what I was thinking for.
I think like at least three or four hours I kept loading in units of the same color instead of the same point value.
And like I.
Don't know why is this thing not working.
It took me forever to grok that also.
40:28
I mean, I've got like 8 hours in this game and I and there were still like just every time I would sit down to play it, there would be a new, like earth shattering revelation.
Oh, there's a hierarchy of energy.
What?
I mean really.
That is on you, Yeah.
That's covered in a tutorial right away.
40:46
For example, as an example.
Oh, there's there's the the I just had a ground or shattering revelation.
The vacation days are also color-coded.
Yep.
What?
Like, OK, I guess that's cool.
41:01
That's neat.
Once your third eye opens or your third energy slot opens and you're just like, Oh my God, I can I get it now It's like, OK now like, I only this only just occurred to me this morning where I was like, Oh my God, this is how this thing works and this is how this thing works.
41:18
And like for the longest time I was dumping red energy cards into everything, 'cause I just thought that.
You mean orange?
What do you what do you got the color blind that's going on?
I was dumping the orange, the tangerine ones into everything, 'cause I just naturally assumed that they were better and like in orange so for.
41:36
There are so.
Many I and I I did not make that same assumption, but like you're constantly making assumptions in this game, just subconsciously.
I feel like that's.
Other games you've played and then you do it one.
Time.
And you realize that it didn't do the thing that you thought it did.
And then you're like, well, let's examine that assumption.
41:54
The fact that it happened so much though with this game like there the the, the the graphic design is is lacking.
The terminology is lacking constantly, you're it's just misunderstanding after misunderstanding.
Form a hypothesis, you test, and then you adjust your behavior based on the results.
42:12
Yes, but it's 10:00 at.
Night to be expected with games, but it it happens with such frequency in this game I think it's.
Too much?
I mean, it does happen more often than it should, but.
Far more often.
Far more often.
And and again, I was like, I don't know, I was like 3 hours in and I'm like, oh, oh, OK, that's that's the difference between energy and points.
42:32
Like.
All right, got it.
Now I understand.
Like.
The real hard one is strength versus power, which is that one's like, confusing all of the time and it never tells you how much strength it has.
So you have to just like, hover your mouse over it and how many it's just.
See, I'd forgotten which has 'cause.
42:48
They're so similar, all right, So power is the one that lasts between runs.
Another revelation put.
Energy in in order to activate the power, the strength is always strength.
And the power, Sorry.
I have the.
Power is a permanent, permanent it.
Is permanent.
43:04
OK.
That's another one of those.
Revelations of the round.
Didn't didn't know about power for for many many hours.
So thank God I'm in such a wonderful and helpful discord group with two wonderful teachers, Colin and Will patiently explained to us legitimately, patiently explained to us how things were go, how how the world works in space, how how, what, how, what life is like and and and life lessons to be learned out.
43:32
To be fair though, like I'm looking through I'm looking through some of these screenshots I took of the tutorial and I'm like what word would I pick that would be better?
And I'm struggling because so in your in your laser showdown, the numbers you know you're you have 9 numbers.
That's like here's your column, here's the enemy's column and numbers.
43:49
This is what you're planning on doing.
The goal is to have your numbers be bigger.
All right, simple enough.
Those numbers are your strength, and then the power is the the permanent bonus effect that's added to your attack units that that is an additive to the numeric value on your energy card that you only put into.
44:14
Enhancement bonus, unit power, like just add another word to it, like more stuff than, just like a single word that is practically the same in like.
In your brain, looking through their their release notes, it sounded like they used to have more words in all the descriptions and it was somehow more confusing.
44:36
Which does that.
That's hope it it it makes you both concerned and hopeful that they're going, they're progressing wars and optimum.
They're they're Speaking of revelations.
Yeah, Colin discovered oh wait, we're we are playing the streamlined and more understandable version of the game's verbiage.
44:58
It's like, yo, that's that's saying something.
I think that perhaps they did go too far the other direction, like maybe in a previous version there was like a wall of text for everyone and they tried to slow, slim it down, simplify it and perhaps they have gone too far.
45:15
Perhaps.
Which is true.
Which is why I think.
Perhaps those.
I think those like F or Into the Breach style animations for the support and the attack units specifically would help a lot because it's like, OK, here's a big wall of text, that's great, but like, So what happens when I do the thing like I can?
45:36
Be a lot of work to make though.
There are like it would be.
There are like 200 units, sure.
That they'd have to make that for.
But yeah, I wonder if that's like, I don't know if that's a thing that they could test and just see like, you know, the is the player experience better as a result of this or what.
45:51
But like, I don't know.
I feel like it is a lot of work.
Maybe there's a cost benefit associated with it, but I feel like it's at least worth a shot for for like a tutorial sequence maybe.
I I think there's also other tools at at Game Designer's disposal that isn't just like, hey, you picked a bad word.
46:10
It's like there there, there could be some kind of, you know, color coding in the text.
It could be some kind of symbology that's used.
There could be just a few extra words like for the Super simple issue, the Super elementary problem that I was having for a long time, which is like what's a unit, what's a point?
46:27
And it's like if it just said unit cards, if that was the game term, like OK, cool, like I would have never had an issue, like just for example.
And I think that perhaps we are, during this episode, gaining greater, greater appreciation for all those board games out there that might have a lot of complicated concepts, but through, you know, various design cues and tools to make it more understanding.
46:53
This might be a.
Game that like bad board games.
Well, well, just like with board games, this might be Lone Star might be a game that like you watch a stream of someone playing and you're like, oh, OK that's that's how that thing works.
Got it.
Versus like, I think I was also shooting myself in my cowboy boot with a revolver as well because like a I'll give this game props like it plays like very well on the Steam deck, which was not something I was really kind of expecting, but the what?
47:21
What?
Were your concerns.
Well, the the the text is.
It's viciously tiny.
And.
Like tiny to the point where it's like I'm like having the the deck like, you know, 3 inches away from my face.
Like, OK, upon loading energy, this unit gains 2 power and powers adjacent attack units and I'm doing like all this mental calculation stuff.
47:43
Meanwhile, like the bus is bouncing back and forth, and the steam deck is just like gyrating all over the.
Person thinking in the text at all.
Yeah, that's cool.
Well, that kind of like that sort of simulates.
You know, like around the bridge of the.
Enterprise and the.
You've been hit by the whatever torpedo and shake.
It around, you're on your space horse.
I I want to know.
48:00
I want to know more about how how Will was able to grok the system of quote UN quote card draw in this game.
Because this game like Lone Star's so different than all the previous deck builders that we played where it's you got a deck, you you draw from it, you know roughly what's in there.
48:19
You know roughly what's coming up.
But this is it's so different of a system, but you were able to like jive with it almost immediately it sounds like.
You form an expectation, you see what happens, You update your expectations and you do that right away.
First round of the first game, What's going to happen when I hit this button and you see this is what happened.
48:37
Well, I was expecting this and this happened.
Maybe this is different hypothesis for what caused that.
But my Bayesian my Bayesian prior does not exist for this kind of system because it's so tuned for discrete card draws.
Like, OK, when am I gonna get that orange three that I saw before?
48:54
Yeah, I feel like the energy draw system is very weird, but for the most part you don't have to understand what it's doing for your effort to work.
It just ends up be it.
Like the difference between understanding it and understanding is like I don't know, cards happen and like you just get something sometimes and it's confusing why, but like you're not being you don't get immediately punished for not understanding it.
49:20
I.
I have a question.
How big is your deck?
It's like less than 10 cards, right?
I mean it's.
Tiny.
You start with 15 point value starting with.
I think it's a what is just 12345 with maybe some duplicate, I don't remember exactly the the structure.
49:38
No, it's 12345 and then.
And you have like 2 whites, 2 Blues and the orange.
No, there there may be like basically just a you have a certain number of colors and a certain number of numbers and then like as you're drawing them, the the color and the number unite into a single card and they just kind of randomly fall into those slots.
49:56
You draw the color and the number separately right?
And then merge them and then the card goes into your hand if they had some sort.
Of like that merging was happening, yeah.
Merging is complete only when you hit play.
Yeah, I mean, it's really just it it, as far as I can tell, it doesn't matter if you understand that.
50:19
Part that's true I'm I'm like like.
Sure.
I'm just like, curious.
Your your next draw has that card you need.
Like, that's usually like, Oh my God, if I don't draw this card, I'm going to die.
I'm like, I'm counting on getting that card.
This one's like, you know?
Hopefully number big.
I mean hopefully number big, that's kind of all that goes into it because there's not a lot of, there's no text on these cards, right?
50:37
There's not like a if this happens or draw to and then like search your deck to find the thing you want.
It's just like a.
Between, you know, some.
Average value of card and some average value of like your, the, the, the, the color and so it's like doesn't really matter so much.
Now there there is one.
Vacation day event that allows you to pick a different deck array if you will.
51:00
It can the the 2 * I encountered that I was like immediately, like like recoiled from my screen like whoa whoa whoa whoa yo.
I don't know the stats.
I haven't run the numbers.
I have no idea how to make a good or bad decision.
51:16
Steph would just fortunately, there's an option to say, you know, exit.
No, thank you.
Bye bye.
Well, you'll know if you want to do that.
Like because of the units you have, maybe, you know, no, I mean like.
If if the units you.
Have are like if if you feed it with one energy like A1 value then it will do some amazing thing.
51:35
Well obviously then if you can convert your deck from 12345 to 111355 or something like that like or 111255 same point value.
But like, Oh yeah, now you have three opportunities.
That proc.
That extra cool thing.
Interesting.
Like that's.
Think about it.
51:51
Less about probabilities and more about like what what What cards do I need to service my build in my ship?
The units to the units.
The term you love excuse.
Me, a technical unit, not cards.
52:06
They're called energy.
The energy is the name of the thing and the point value on it is called point.
That's all.
It's just called point, not point value, just point, which is another mind boggling.
I do want to call out one game term that I.
Do like we we talked about earlier.
52:23
Lanes.
Yeah.
Love it.
Ain't gonna confuse that.
No siree, yeah, but what does showdown?
Showdown.
In showdown mean.
Oh, I think showdown.
Isn't that the?
Term for That's the laser fight.
It's the laser.
Fight but every.
52:38
Time.
It says failure in showdown, but it's on the enemy.
You're like, is this if I fail or if it's that the enemy fails, Like do I want to win this lane or not?
I don't.
I can't tell.
Question.
Hey, enough about this mechanical.
Crap.
52:54
Let's talk about some of these characters.
This game has so many fun pets that you can play.
Has so many fun pets.
There's an entire race of alien cats, folks.
I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the cats of Othar.
I'm talking about space cats going around and having fun and I'm lying.
53:11
They're all just like the devs pets rights.
And they just said, hey, wouldn't it be fun if we just turned oh really into?
A character.
You know what?
It is fun.
It's stupid, but we have Mapa.
It's fine.
We'd have Mapa.
We have, but there's.
Some fucking we.
Have all the stars.
53:27
Absolutely.
What what do we think about the characters?
I think it it's a great idea to have them show up in the vacation days, like whoever, you know?
Yeah, that would make way more present.
Elsewhere, right?
Rather than showing your ship if you show your.
Pilot Oh yeah.
53:42
I like that idea.
Like that's a.
Simple.
That doesn't even require them to do.
More art.
They just use the existing art but make it bigger.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
That's, that's.
That's a good call.
That's a good yeah.
There.
There's a lot of like.
There's a lot of heart put into I think the the world building that I think just needs to be fleshed out more and yeah between now and like one point O release I can totally see that happening where you know you your your cat pilot rolls into a bar and like somehow you know your your your cat avatar is on like one side then like the the you know the robot so that's an operator is on.
54:17
The other side like it's.
Such a fun.
It's such like a fun.
Visual that you're just like yeah, I'm not here for you.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Your cat pilot with the little.
Like you know Scouter eye patch or whatever it sits down to a a game, a hand of Lone Star.
And then there's like the close up of the Paw Old Union pushing the cards and the chips forward.
54:38
Yeah, but OK anyway.
But maybe that's a little bit of scope.
But you know there's there's hey developers, you know you got our interest with the characters and with the setting and and and we're we're we're we're thirsty for more.
Like what about how overpowered some of them are?
Relative to others?
54:54
I don't know.
Colin.
I I think Colin.
You you you notice this too?
Oh yeah, the guy who?
The guy who?
If you get a legendary, you just get two of that legendary insane insanely better than all of the rest of the pilots.
Like Easy mode win.
Wow.
Yeah, and.
Then and like the abilities.
55:10
Of these guys like some of them are just absolute trash tier like the the first no hat you get which is like you know you get what is it.
You get coins when you repair yeah when you repair right relatively amount that you repair So you're like incentivize to take damage.
So that way when you do upgrade what you should typically have to pay to do or in some cases not.
55:29
But like it's just like a way, a very weird way of getting more money like versus other ones which are just like way, way better.
And I don't have a like I think I'm lots of like, you know, ton of these characters over the course of my like what, 14 hours or so.
But like yeah, some of them are just like this is just overpowered and like the difference in like it's your expected outcomes is dramatically different.
55:53
Yeah, maybe there could be a little.
Leveling of the playing field, perhaps?
I mean, it's fun, like how many characters?
Are there like 25 or 30?
There's so many different pilots, I put a bounty on some of them.
Yeah, so like if.
You don't like some of them?
56:10
Then just reroll a couple times till you find one that's good yo that mechanic.
It's pretty weird.
What is going on?
There, I mean it's.
Definitely like so.
So there's a mechanic to if you.
You get a choice of three different pilots when you start.
You don't get to choose from all of them, which my guess is they they they're like we've put in too many pilots.
56:30
We need a way to make sure that people don't just play as the one the whole time.
So we'll make it a a resource to to reroll them that that needs to be retuned because.
I you said, oh, there's 25 different.
For me, there's only one character and that's master thief Wolfie.
56:48
Well, you won't be able to get master.
Thief Wolfie as you progress in the game because you won't show Well, I've played eight hours and I.
Can get her pretty consistently, I feel like.
Well, you might have let her.
Just might have left it all in. 10 together for a little bit, but at least.
Five or six, Interesting, to be honest.
57:03
I don't know if feels like so.
So you're saying you did run out of rerolls?
No, I have like 45 left.
Yeah.
You.
I've never rerolled.
Like I wanna play all the new things and so it's just like, let me pick from what you have and that was I rerolled until I wanted to.
Try out the ship that's bigger.
Like there's the one pilot that says I just I I instead of the starting ship I I come with my own ship and is big.
57:24
Really.
Yeah, it's a.
It's.
Five by three or four by Is it a big ship instead of?
Yeah, as far as I can tell, it really doesn't play that differently 'cause you still are only limited to 9 total units, which honestly that's one of the other things that didn't.
57:41
The balance of the game was kind of weird in that you they they trickle out.
You start out with being able to have 6 units in your ship and then they trickle out the 7-8 and nine, which means that you're just kind of it's a linear increase in power over time.
I I feel like there should be some trade off in here that lets you say, oh, I want to fill up my my whole ship with real crappy units or I want one unit in the middle that's worth like half of the weight of my ship.
58:10
And it's just like everything there are there is that.
Mechanic.
I mean, there's a there's a number of 0 weights.
There's not that many, though.
Not that.
That's that's fair.
Yeah, there's like.
A couple of them, and there's like.
One or two that are worth 2, but they're not very good and I've never found it to be worth it.
58:26
Here's a question.
Would the game be?
Better if like in Galaxy Trucker you you only take damage for things that you have like tiles for.
So for example, you know if you have like you you have your three by three grid and then you just leave your top grid empty and then they try to shoot at it, but there's there's no quote unit to hit.
58:47
Would that be a way to balance it?
No, no, I mean, it could be you.
Would be a different game.
They'd have to to rebalance a lot of stuff for that.
But yeah, a lot of, a lot of the two different enemies like.
Rely on you being three wide.
And if you just like, of course right now, then there's a big mechanic which is you can move up or down to avoid shots kind of in some sense.
59:07
And a lot of what they do is that they'll either fire all their shots down the center lane or I'm just in the outside lanes or those just a movement and a combination of things.
And so I feel like they'd have to rebalance a lot of stuff if you suddenly made yourself essentially only 2/3 of the the size of a target.
59:25
Yeah, I can see that.
But I wonder if.
Another note that I have in here is all of at least all of the attack units that I've played with have always shot in straight lines.
I'm wondering if like, what about things that shoot in like AY or AW or like shoot from the top one to the bottom or always shoot the, you know, the the enemy showdown lane with the highest value or something like that.
59:51
I'm and again like I'm sure these are things that they've all thought of and were like, no, that idea was terrible and that's why maybe not putting it there.
But the the point is there's a lot.
Of room for expansion and and and new ideas and stuff.
It's already a cool system and there's there's room to add add more.
1:00:07
I mean, I think the biggest thing that they.
Not should change, but need to change is they need to change the difficulty curve of beating it more than once.
I think that it is too hard to beat it your first time and then as you beat it with like the ascension levels, the difficulty does not ramp up very fast.
1:00:25
They need to make it significantly easier to win your first run it you guys shouldn't.
It shouldn't have taken you 8 hours to get a win that's too long.
And then it should just be, you know, Ascension Level 3 is like substantially harder than the base, which it's not.
1:00:42
Well, oh, they've got 15% more health or something.
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess maybe maybe to.
Pivot on that Ascension theme a little bit, have we mentioned Slay the Spire yet?
Like there, there doesn't feel like there's a big bad in this game.
1:00:58
Like yeah, you're going and collecting bounties and then I think the the big boss that I collected the bounty on was like, you know, potentially some space Italian gangster.
But like, is that it?
Like, I feel like there's like, what's the Force driving all of this skullbuggery in the Galaxy?
1:01:18
Like, where's where's like, the Slay the Spire titular heart.
Both Slay the Spire and Monster Train have a thing.
Where you take on burdens in the the early game in order to unlock the final boss.
So like for this it would be like you take on a unit that just doesn't do anything or something like that and it's like and then if you can beat the boss with that, then you fight the actual boss, like the the true crime Lord Laura Palpatine or Snoke or whoever.
1:01:42
That wouldn't really fit the bounty hunting theme though.
Right.
Well, those are the other ones.
Are like the epic story.
Of like saving the world or something like close to saving the universe.
This is just like, Oh yeah, I want I'm in it for the latinum.
I mean, this would be the truest bounty theme.
This would be every bounty hunter story, which is the bounty hunter goes after bounties and then eventually he gets attached to Kid Yoda and then he actually do good in the universe.
1:02:05
I mean, every bounty hunter story is well, but he's actually got a heart of gold.
Then he saves the day at the end.
That's the other thing is like, I kind of want.
To be able to go the bad guy route of like I'm just getting for the cash and it's.
Nothing personal, kid.
And.
Like, oh this this small innocent kid spaceship who ran off with a lollipop.
1:02:27
I could not get that.
Bam, bam bam bam bam.
That'd be kind of.
Neat.
I wouldn't mind the idea of like a because each run is independence.
That's fine.
But like if there's a Galaxy sort of sentiment where it's like where it's like on the scale of like you know, there's good things happening, general or evil things.
And that might change the sort of like events that you encounter or or change the sort of units because you know this is the everything's dead because you've killed it all and so suddenly the stock is low and or it's like more rusted or something takes longer than I don't know, something like that, a fable esque sort of Now I I don't know if your ship starts getting devil's horns on it.
1:03:02
Yeah, what's the mechanic that we need?
Like, OK, so OK, here's the premise here.
You you, you have the ability to create someone mechanic and introduce to the game or remove a mechanic and that's the thing that's going to like make it a, you know, whatever your point value is right now, it's going to do plus one to that.
1:03:19
What's that?
What's that mechanic for me?
I think it would be.
Like your your character's alignment and you start off like as a neutral bounty hunter, but like you go through like event quests or like depending on who you collect bounties on.
1:03:37
If you so choose to, then you either become more and more of a goodie or more and more of a baddie.
I want your vacation days.
To somehow affect your run in, in terms of the combat, I want you to be like, OK, cool.
1:03:53
You could either take this thing or you could take the legendary unit and the next enemy you fight is going to be a little bit harder.
Or take the you know, here you go.
You get this unit and also a choice of do you want your next enemy that you fight to be offensive or defensive or something like just a little bit more rather than just here's 12 fights in a row with no choice whatsoever?
1:04:19
Like put something that lets you affect the path that you're on even a little bit?
Yeah, a more engaging story.
Would be good for me and we've we've discussed you know some potential mechanical ways to do that.
But just so that when I end a run I can kind of look back at it and think yeah, there was like an approximate any that that happened aside from like my ship fought 12 guys and beat them.
1:04:45
Yeah, Bygum Yeehaw.
Well, lucky lucky joy of wait, Will didn't answer.
Well, this is.
The will was able to figure.
This game out in 2 seconds if a war makes it better.
OK, so.
But just 'cause I figured this game.
1:05:00
Out doesn't mean that.
Like, I mean I I don't give it a great rating as as you'll find here.
I mean I thought it was a a fine game but like I'm I'm actually struggling here as I'm just you know in this one minute brainstorming I had while you got all over like give it, I I don't know what mechanic would make this game like the one thing that would make it like a space jokers.
1:05:21
You know, I was just going to.
Say that I I'm really struggling here 'cause I mean.
Once there's something to be said about like interesting characters that you care about but like I mean the actual chess puzzle of the the combat is fine I guess I I wanna feel like I don't know what's the what's the thing like when I'm selecting a like in a in a Aspire of course like this like de facto like OK so you're you you've just won you get a choice of one of three things or like you know the of of categories you get some gold one of three for a card like I think there's something with the energy and like the energies the.
1:05:54
Energy and like color system.
Is just inherently like maybe not so interesting.
And like I want like, I mean, I know that the units are supposed to be like carrying the card sort of like synergies and all that stuff.
But I'm having a hard time articulating.
1:06:10
But there's something like that's like lacking about that and like when I'm drawing cards and play Aspire, every single hand drastically effects what I'm gonna do.
Whereas in this thing it's like, Yep, OK yeah, I I want big number with which is more more orange in general.
1:06:25
So I want I want there to be something about the card draw dynamic which is just more fun because I've basically game is won, energy should do something, the game is won or lost.
When you end the.
Battle Do you have the right units or not And that's kind of like what it comes down to is it's a it's a Yep, OK you're just feeding the units the the color as opposed to slay aspire.
1:06:45
There's more strategy about I want to draw this card so I can look into my deck to find the thing that I need to use.
And like there's a lot more of that sort of that feeling of I made a difference.
Autonomy and like personal choice are impactful on the combat like tactical level.
1:07:01
That's what it is.
That's what it is right there.
Yeah, like that's that's a hard.
That's not really like a specific thing though.
That's like make the combat better, no?
That.
That's what I'm saying.
Is that like drawing card energy and color is bad?
I think it's community, I think.
1:07:17
I think.
That I think that's.
I think that limits the the, the, the, the maximum goodness this game has.
I think it's a unique thing and I can understand why the developer might be like, Oh yeah, no one's done this particular thing.
But now we know why and we've seen it, we've tried it and it's like, it's not that fun, is there?
1:07:34
Is there like a a theme?
That's missing where like red energy is like is your interruption energy, is orangey.
It literally says orange.
In the that.
Scott is proposing.
Another.
Color.
Yeah, there we go.
Color.
Well, maybe not colors.
1:07:50
Maybe.
Misunderstood.
I get what you're saying.
It's like most of the player agency and like decision making is made pre battle and then the majority of the game is spent in a battle that's kind of already been based on how you how you which, hey, do we want to talk about the retreat?
1:08:06
Yeah, I I want.
To highlight this because we made a point earlier about there like not being like a whole lot of roguiness.
And I think the thing that grokked for me just today was that, aha, yes, there is roguiness to this in the sense that again, I didn't find out about the retreat mechanic until yesterday.
1:08:24
Even again, it's in the tutorial.
I don't know how I missed it.
I didn't miss it.
I misunderstood.
It I thought it was limited like other similar things.
I mean, the game's thrown a lot of the tutorial.
I thought it was limited time.
I assumed.
It was so I assumed.
Like the supply drops or whatever, like the the call for help or call for repairs which are like one per game.
1:08:45
I thought, oh, you can only you can retreat once per Galaxy or something, because as it is, you can retreat infinitely, which seems like a terrible Band-Aid.
Well, that's where an early actress game, that's where I think it worked.
For me, because the final boss fight, I had this build going that like, it just barely worked to like get the the boss down to like three hit points consistently.
1:09:09
I'm like, Oh my God, there's OK, there's a way to thread this needle here.
Retreat.
Like OK, what other items do I have banked up here What if I put this one here let's try that run for like a a couple runs like OK, this is clearly not working.
Retreat.
What about what if I do this What if I do this other there's like this experimentation angle that I'm like oh OK this is where the the taking the stuff from your bag of tricks and experimenting and seeing how you get through this puzzle works.
1:09:42
And I think for like it was kind of annoying on the final boss.
But I think I kind of painted myself into a corner with my build to some extent.
And I was able I, you know I was able to have the the legendary thing do damage every time I loaded energy into it.
I got the numbers engine in such a way that it just it barely worked on the last turn I was about to die and I was like, all right I did it.
1:10:05
I think I can wait until 1.0 now and that's not fun.
Though right like that.
Game where you are just I think I saw on the screenshot you retreated 10 * I I retreated.
Nine times in my victory, that's a different game.
1:10:21
The the game.
Where you're like doing the same fight over and over again and you're just trying to thread the needle.
That's not that's into the breach.
Where?
You're using time warp holes.
Well, you you get one.
That's the thing about.
Into the breach is like, oh, you didn't understand this mechanic.
You made a mistake.
All right, you get one retry.
1:10:38
This one's just it needs to punish you.
It needs to say.
That's it, That's enough.
You got, you understand it.
Maybe you don't.
That's fine.
You get one.
You should be able to take back your turn.
Not, oh, take that energy of placement.
Yeah, like if you.
Like, drop a reset.
Oh, you didn't mean to?
1:10:54
That's locked in.
That's stupid.
Well.
I have a note.
I have a note.
In here, 'cause there's a game called Slice and Dice that is very similar in the aspect that, like, it has unlimited undos to, I guess to some extent.
But, like, there's there's like you can you undo your turn, like infinitely in that to see, like, OK, well, this proposed solution that I had didn't work out.
1:11:16
Undo, undo, undo.
What if I do this thing instead?
Oh, well, that seems like it kind of works better.
And I was thinking, like, would that work better here?
And I don't.
I don't think so, 'cause I think there's so many units that so many attack and support units that you accumulate throughout a run that there's there's synergies that you may not have thought about that maybe punishment is a good idea here.
1:11:40
But for me it worked out that like, oh, like there was the synergy I didn't expect to happen.
That just got me over the lip to to beat the boss.
And maybe, maybe that's not the ideal game mechanic for everybody.
And yeah, like, it wasn't I like, I was just kind of like forcing the win at that point.
1:11:59
Like it wasn't, it wasn't out of fun.
It was more of like, I have to beat the boss, because if I go on the podcast and I'm the only one that hasn't beaten the boss yet, I'm gonna get raked over the coals.
So yeah, I I.
Had more or less the same experience.
It's like, let me try playing it a different way.
Let me try remixing my unit placements like and when the win finally arrived, let me ask you, Scott, how did it feel to to beat the big bad final boss?
1:12:28
It felt all right, I feel.
Like again, if it was 'cause it for me, it felt great.
Yeah, I mean like.
Because I I had ground and like for me there was literally like one in like it was like a one in 300.
Possible solutions like this is the only one that works, I think largely because of how I set my ship up.
1:12:46
But yeah, I think like, you beat the boss once, you're like, OK, now I know what to expect from the boss fight.
I'll tune towards that.
You would you would have better luck in the future especially if you understand the synergies.
And like, Oh yes, orange energies don't inherently do more damage.
1:13:02
Like I thought for like 4 hours of my play time.
Yeah.
I think that like, for me it was a little hollow because there wasn't like, what's the narrative thrust that I'm solving here?
Like, OK, I I got.
I got the, the big Don Corleone ship.
That's it.
1:13:18
And yeah, like early access, sure, I understand.
But like what?
What is my goal here other than just grinding the latinum?
Am I grinding the latinum to retire?
Like can I finally retire onto the to the to Ryzen?
Yeah, to.
1:13:35
To the.
RIM world, yeah.
And to be clear, so before.
We get off the topic.
To be clear, I was very happy to have the retreat button and to finally realize, oh, I can use it infinitely.
At last, I can.
Finally beat this game and feel some sense of satisfaction and but it's obviously you know a temporary it's a crutch.
1:13:56
It's a crutch and and there's no way that makes it to final roll and if it does then that's a that's a big issue as you said.
Well then that's a different game.
Should we should we do ratings?
Yeah, yeah.
Andrew, kick us off with.
Ratings here.
Easy to do this to me all right?
1:14:11
Check it out.
I was incredibly for us maybe the second time I made it to the final boss because there was a mechanic did not understand and it was a unique mechanic that that was already difficult for me to understand to begin with because I was having so much trouble grocking what was going on.
1:14:31
And then on top of that it was it was like it was a it was a it was a new unique mechanic and I thought at the time I could only retreat one.
I was like this game has has has screwed me over.
I'm so mad.
Etcetera, etcetera.
And and that got me thinking about like how how do I review this game?
1:14:49
I started, I started I started philosophizing and I'm like, I got to come up with some kind of some sort of rubric for this game.
I'm like, all right well, who do I recommend this even games that I hate.
Like personally I'll recommend I I could see myself having a conversation with someone being like, you know I played a game it wasn't my favorite.
1:15:08
But what you're describing, your game taste that you're describing, I think you would like next game, I think you would like Y game and I came to the conclusion in its current state I would recommend this to no one and therefore I said it is last place.
1:15:26
It is my bottom of the heap game.
But as we've discussed as we were having a conversation, it's raised ever so slightly, and I can say definitively pretty pretty certainly that I would probably recommend Lone Star in Early Access, with all its weird, wonky stuff.
1:15:44
I would recommend it before recommending Cataclysm.
Barely 'cause there are some players, there are some people I've met where it's like, Oh yeah, I think he'd be into this weird, like, granularity.
But anyway, just because, and that's only the reason I'm breaking it up, this is this is such a like subjective silly thing, is that the that beating the final boss was exciting.
1:16:06
A lot of the fights were exciting and engaging.
The core combat mechanics once you understand them, which can take a while, especially if you're an FPS meathead like me, is legitimately fun.
And I am confident that in the 1.0 I'm pretty confident that it will be.
1:16:23
If I re reviewed it it, it wouldn't be second to last, but as it stands, second to last game just above.
I'll go next.
I think like my my ranking number is gonna sound more brutal than I think my ranking verbiage.
1:16:41
I think this game is fun.
I think it has an interesting art direction and aesthetic that I want to see more of or like more fleshed out in this game.
I feel like the the harmonica tune and like soft guitar strumming that goes on like I want.
1:16:57
I want more of that like motif in like the tense battle sequences.
Like there's there's like flavor there that I'm like, hmm, yes, this does taste nice.
I would like more of it, please.
I like the fact that the math is auto calculated like in monster train.
Like I can't imagine having to sit there and be like, all right, what's?
1:17:14
So this number equals this.
This is this.
It would be unplayable.
Yeah, it it.
Would be pretty bad.
But hey, you know, maybe there's a an enemy unit that can obfuscate what their number is.
I think the the card and energy system is is kind of a challenge to grok because it's so different.
1:17:34
I like the fact that it's different.
I like the fact that there's like a someone's trying to do something new in this space even if I didn't get it for the longest time.
And yeah, I think the the biggest, the biggest kind of issues so far are just like the verbiage is is pretty terse, but I think they're kind of aware of it and they're trying to fix it.
1:17:55
So yeah, it'll be interesting to see with one point O how much, how much of that they improve on.
Yeah, I think it just, it just needs a little bit more time in the oven, which is fine.
Early access.
It's only been out for a few months.
That's gonna put it for like a 6.75 for me, which you know, like it's a it's a good, solid, meaty part of the middle curve on on my ratings.
1:18:19
And I I think that like once it comes out one point O, they'll have a lot more stuff in it, a lot more Polish and it'll jump up those rankings significantly.
You don't have a meaty part of the curve, you have a Tri.
Modal distribution?
Oh.
Got em, I mean.
Look at this.
1:18:34
It's just ridiculous.
Like you're you're you're inflating so many shitty games because you feel bad, but then some other ones, you're just like, fuck em, I'm gonna go ahead and like, rake em over the coals, but I I there's hardly any meat on that trimodal bone.
Come on.
Exactly.
But, you know, fair enough.
1:18:50
I mean, we're all.
Entitled to our own opinions here.
I just wish it was consistent, is all I'm saying, regardless of.
Scott's Let me just move Rimworld down.
Another nine spots here regardless of.
His His pitchfork.
Of of ratings.
I'm going to give it A7.
1:19:07
What was that rating again?
I was laughing at 7:00.
I thought it was an interesting game.
I really liked the concept of it.
I liked the theme off the bat.
I think that that can could future, maybe do more with it.
1:19:26
I thought that the the puzzles were good at first, once you once you got over the like understanding how the things work.
But I think the thing that kept it from being a higher ranked game for me is that I got bored with it after a couple of runs.
1:19:44
The difficulty didn't.
The difficulty started high and then didn't increase.
And then for whatever reason it feels like all of the strategies.
You're just you're doing different things to achieve the exact same thing no matter what.
You're trying to get 3 numbers big and you're doing it in different ways, but at the end you're kind of, it feels all the strategies end up feeling pretty samey.
1:20:10
So like.
It had a a good hook but not as you know, as you reeled it in.
It ended up being a smaller fish than I thought it was going to be.
So 7 out of 10.
I mean excellent analysis.
Colin I.
Mean I I have to agree here 7 out of 10 I mean I I think it was a it's it's a slay the spot it's ASTS like game I think and it falls into that category or or what we're calling that anyways and sleigh like sleigh like yeah is that is that what the term is.
1:20:39
I I think there's a lot of new ideas in this but unfortunately the new ideas just aren't that compelling and I already gave my my analysis of like what I think they can do differently but I think that you're yeah the same the same E Nos is is very true like an Aspire if you're going for a corruption build you're the cards you're picking and the strategy you're doing is very different and it feels like what you're choosing in game is it like in terms of like on a per turn basis is very unique and it's all very satisfying as it builds it ladders up to this strategy which is unique to the build whereas this time in this game it's just Yep 3 lanes get bigger number like that's that is what it boils down to.
1:21:23
So I don't know.
I don't know that there is a fundamental change that will say that I think it's going to be stuck here in this unfortunate 7, maybe 8 with some improvement stage.
But it's this is never going to be a tenant game.
It's never going to be truly an epic or great game.
1:21:39
So yeah, 7.
All right.
Well, very quickly some.
Similar games.
I think the the the most similar game to this right off the bat is Cobalt Core, which is like a a pixely much more kind of traditional deck builder rogue game with I guess like Starfox style characters and banter.
1:22:05
It's much more cute and and like, a lot pinker than this game, but it it's it's almost like exactly the same kind of idea where you have a ship, you're moving around against another ship and you're shooting stuff and you're you're using offense as defense kind of stuff.
1:22:24
Like, it was kind of amazing that Cobalt Core and Lone Start came out like roughly around the same time as each other, 'cause their ideas are so similar, their execution is very different.
But yeah, like Cobalt Core stands like far and away as like the most similar game to Lone Star.
I think they can learn a lot from each other.
1:22:41
We talked a lot about FTL and Slave, the Spire of Cores, and then some deck builder games that have come out recently that have kind of put interesting spins on the genre.
I'll list off quickly here.
Chrono Arc recently just came out of One Point O.
