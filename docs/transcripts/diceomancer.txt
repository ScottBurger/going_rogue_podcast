greetings friends and welcome to yet another episode of the Grog The Pod roguelike podcast wherein
each episode we roll the die on a roguelike game, sometimes landing on a Nat 20 and sometimes with a
0:45
crit fail.
Revisiting those those high rolling games at the end of the year for a good old fashioned recap
0:53
episode.
Everyone's favorite.
0:54
I am your Piggy King host of the podcast Scott Burger and with me are my Co hosts Emerging from the
Purple Mist.
1:02
This is Will Wright, you're Sage with the most reliable deck.
And this is Colin, a very aggressive goose.
1:09
And lastly, Andrew Harshman here, you know I got a soft spot for anime.
I'm the life of Lifomancer.
1:18
Yes, this this week we are talking the roguelike deck builder Daisomancer, released relatively
recently, October 9th, 2024.
1:29
I believe this is a Steam exclusive developed by Ultra Piggy Studio out of Beijing, China that was
founded in 2023 consisting of four people, 2 artists and two developers whose only other previous
1:43
work I think was a prototype for this game that was an itch itched on IO Game Jam game for the game
makers Toolkit Game Jam called Dice is the way and I think if you Google if you Google dices the way
1:57
you'll quickly see ah yes, this does indeed look like a prototype for dysomancer.
Dysomancer is published by I'm gonna say Gamera games Gamera games depending on on your Godzilla
2:09
fandom notable publishers of drumroll Dyson sphere program shapes with AZ 2.
Stay tuned in 1/2 rogue like deck builder Shogun showdown.
2:21
We got TMN teenage mutant Ninja Turtles shredders revenge very well regarded and weirdly the last
spell because I think since since the last time we covered it.
2:33
The last spell has since changed publishers from the arcade crew to gamera games gamera games.
But yeah, reasonably good portfolio there, Dyson.
2:45
Reasonably good, Incredible, incredible last spell.
Good stuff.
2:50
Isomancer.
Your average player has about 18 hours of gameplay in it, and it rolls in on our roguelike
2:57
popularity charts as the 230th most popular roguelike game with 4394 total reviews.
Will you?
3:06
You are compelled to describe what one does in Dysomancer in exactly 999 sentences, unless you
choose to change that number.
3:16
Well, I think I can roll a dice and make that one sentence here.
And it's a it's a really OK, the very simple one sentence summary is that it is a this is going to
3:27
sound.
It's it's a worse slate of Spire with some different mechanics focusing on this primary thing, which
3:36
is rolling a dice to replace and or rolling a die to replace any number that you see on the screen.
Now I was very excited when we were going through the the picking process and trying to figure out
3:46
what what game are we going to follow follow up Noita with and bending around some ideas.
It's a will episode.
3:55
So it has to be a rogue like deck builder where contractually contractually obligated.
And there's, you know, there's like a handful of overwhelmingly positive rogue like deck builders.
4:05
We've covered a lot of them so far.
Bilatro slaves, fire, of course, inscription, monster train, but there's a few that we haven't
4:12
covered.
And I was very excited to see Daiso Mancer on this list of overwhelmingly positive roguelike deck
4:18
builders, which means it's got to be a hit.
But I think looking back through some of our our previous episodes, a game being highly rated does
4:29
not guarantee that we will highly rate it.
Looking back at some of our overwhelmingly positive whiffs we have, I think I think Against the
4:38
Storm is overwhelmingly positive that I think I was the only one that liked.
I think we were unanimous and whipping on Brotato.
4:46
I'm pretty sure Cult of the Lamb is overwhelmingly positive.
And really I'm pretty sure it is.
4:52
Check me on that.
And I believe.
4:56
It was, it was fine, but it was overwhelmingly positive.
Yeah, I guess like.
5:00
It's a fine game.
What what I mean by whiff here is like our our like, you know, it's fine not matching like the the
5:07
steam level of like Oh my God, like I I I take overwhelmingly positive to be like, oh, you're gonna
really like this regardless of who you are but or at.
5:18
Least one of you is going to love this game.
One of one out of four chance for sure.
5:23
And I guess that landed with Against the Storm.
I I will still kind of bat for 60% of that game, but yeah, I think 60%.
5:32
Oh wow.
But I was very excited because Dyson Mancher, I had played, yeah, I think the demo for it at one of
5:39
one of like the next fest, Steam Next Fest events or something like that.
And I was like, oh, this is this is interesting.
5:45
What do you mean you played it at the the next fest?
Well, I I went I.
5:49
Went on your steam?
Deck Yeah, the the I went to the steam.
5:53
You went to Bellevue?
I went to the Steam con at my desktop computer and I downloaded the demo along with, you know, I
6:02
waited in line to download the demo, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
6:07
You had to wait in line.
You did.
6:09
You did cosplay for it, which I I commend you.
Yeah, Oh yeah, I'm wearing, I'm wearing a purple hoodie right now.
6:15
This.
And yeah, ironically, this is somehow like.
6:18
That's your Noida outfit.
Excellent.
6:20
Yeah, this is our our a trilogy of accidental purple purple hoodie episodes that we've gotten
between Noida and God.
6:28
What was the game that we played before Noida?
This.
6:30
Like despite all of the Azure dreams?
Did Azure Dreams have a purple no rift wizard?
6:36
OK so I guess it's not a trilogy.
For some reason it felt like a trilogy.
6:38
Yes enough.
I just kind of like blacked out Remnant and Azure dreams.
6:43
Grog Pod your number one source for coverage of purple robed games.
It's a burgeoning genre.
6:51
I like, yeah, that's actually a good name for a company.
Purple Robe Gaming.
6:55
I mean, I could definitely see that as a thing.
Absolutely.
6:58
Ian POD stands for Purple.
Yes, as as we all know.
7:04
But yeah, the, the tutorial or the demo that I had, I had downloaded, I'm like, oh, like this, this
art style feels very unique.
7:14
And the demo just kind of gives you enough of a taste that I'm like, OK, playing through this little
tutorial sequence, I'm like, Yep, this, this seems very interesting.
7:23
And then when Will picked it for steps and I'm like, oh, awesome.
Like I'm I'm very excited to to dive deep into the complex crunchy game mechanics of this surely
7:34
next evolution of spired like card mechanics.
But, but gauging, but, yeah, but but dot, dot dot gauging from our last two weeks of playing, maybe
7:50
that has not resonated so well.
Yeah, that's that's an understatement.
7:55
I think if we check the logs here about how we're feeling about the game as we're playing it, I'm
not seeing a lot of oh man, this is so great.
8:01
I'm having such a great time.
It's like, I don't get, this is stupid.
8:05
This is why are they doing it like this, that kind of feeling.
I'm checking my logs here.
8:09
I'm, I'm seeing there's a lot of Noida updates of me, which will be getting a reappraisal in the
Omega Bowl.
8:19
Yeah, well, hey, look, you know, why are we, why are we getting off on such a dour note?
You know, here there's there's there's much to be examined and enjoyed in this game.
8:29
I'm, you know, hey boys, we're back.
We're finally playing another first person shooter, which is great and Foo boy, there's a lot of
8:38
weapons and there's a lot of there's a lot of art and of course, this game takes place uniquely it
from a first person perspective.
8:45
As you are traveling across in in this game, you're traveling across a exactly FTL map.
It is horizontally arrayed and there is a a force that is that is pushing towards you from the left
9:00
hand side.
You can't shoot a gun at a goose.
9:03
You can shoot a gun at a goose.
If you've ever crossed by Untitled Goose Game and thought, gosh, I wish I could just blast that
9:10
sucker, you can.
You can do that, but uniquely it is from a first person perspective, which is kind of fun.
9:17
And the the animations like you when you are casting and using your cards, which might be, you know,
different like sword attacks or crossbow attacks or Canon attacks.
9:26
Maybe you are you are seeing your hands out before you and this and this is all illustrated and and
drawn in a sort of a little bit sketchier but but definitely like sort of the Studio Ghibli type.
9:40
Of I I really liked the art S that.
Very close.
9:43
Oh yeah, visually, very much enjoyed this game.
Low FPS because I mean, I just feel like, yeah, they're just like animating just a few frames for
9:51
everything essentially.
Yeah, and I think the low FPS like it that that it worked with the art style.
9:57
It has like a kind of dreamy quality.
It feels like a 1930s cartoon, kind of.
10:03
Am I wrong?
Like like janky low frame rate, like the big big Mickey Mouse, like cartoon hands.
10:10
I'm.
Not sure.
10:11
It's very like exaggerated, I suppose in terms of like the art direction.
And, you know, I'm, yeah, I'm sure that the, the, the, the, the, the small number of key frames is,
10:23
is probably, you know, production.
I think it would have been worse with more with the smoother animation.
10:31
I think that the like type of it like it I I don't know as like a dream sequence vibe to me, like
pastel colors, like landscape stuff like I think it works really well with what they were going for
10:46
aesthetically.
I don't think it really like it doesn't seem to be particularly relevant to the game play for I
10:54
think it is good.
Yeah, and one of the reasons I'm excited for it in terms of the dreamlike quality is kind of
11:00
ethereal.
Like even when an object is sitting stationary, like there are different frames that that sort of
11:08
undulate and the, and the stroke lines that make up a character kind of move slightly.
And, and sometimes I find that like inaccurate, kind of sketchy, like quality to be off putting.
11:19
But in this case, I think it works very good.
And the low frame rate, I think you're right, complements that.
11:25
And what is being depicted is what what what do we have here?
It's it's vaguely anime in terms of art direction.
11:34
It's it's has it's sort of AII.
I'm sensing seeing some some Western and Eastern fantasy.
11:41
Astoral.
It feels like a mother's grim like fairy tale book with crossbows with.
11:47
Crossbows.
Yes.
11:49
This, Yeah.
It's like, it's like Grim Grim Brothers cross with Studio Ghibli.
11:54
Right.
And you're traveling across the land.
11:58
I don't rightly recall what to what end.
You've got you've got three acts just like Slate, Aspire and upon No spoilers here by by the way.
12:08
You have all finished the game right?
Or like.
12:10
Absolutely.
Not Nope.
12:12
How many hours you had before?
I had many.
12:15
I mean I've got 8.6 in it.
Did you?
12:18
Beat it on like your second run I did.
Yeah.
12:20
But that's that's because.
Blif Wizard at work again, Just cranking out these games.
12:25
He's a machine.
The man's a machine.
12:27
I feel like once you've crossed it over into that Ascension 20 threshold of Slay the Spire, you're
like, you can just like immediately see through all of the game mechanics for card games and you're
12:36
just like, no, I've already beaten it.
I don't even have to play it anymore.
12:39
Yeah.
And if there was a different scale, then I might be like thrown off like right now, like this latest
12:43
fire, you know, attack does 5 damage.
Like this one was just slightly like reduced.
12:47
So your main attack, like the kind of basic attack was 4 damage.
But like that was easy for me to scale to like understand every single card basically immediately.
12:55
But the point like after you beat the the final dude, the whole point of it is then you go fishing
and there is a little fishing sequence and so.
13:04
Unlike the tutorial is like you go fishing and then you come back from fishing.
I kind of want to talk a little bit about tutorial because I, I think like the the tutorial does a a
13:15
very good job of kind of setting the stage for for like what this game is.
It's very clearly like a Spire like you have cards at the bottom and you play them.
13:24
But I I love that like the tone of the game is so like cozy vibes like right at the start we're like
prologue hit the tutorial.
13:33
You're like me.
What a great day.
13:35
Let's go fishing on the West side of the village and you have this very cute like fairy tale
landscape in front of you.
13:42
Got the, the, the Dutch windmill going on the hill, this little cobblestone path that you know, just
looks like something out of a of a cute little fairy tale.
13:52
There's a town out in the distance.
You're like, Oh yeah, this does look like a great day to go fishing.
13:56
Why not?
Big poofy clouds.
13:59
And then like all like normal fishing trips that you happen to go on, you go to the next node on the
map and you're encountered your, your path is blocked by a drooling wolf that you have to, you know,
14:11
take swords out of your pocket to to slash to death, you know, like your standard fishing adventure.
Right, right.
14:16
Like something right out of the Andy Griffith intro, an orc steps into the the way and and then
Gomer Pyle has to collaborate with a pile.
14:27
Yeah, interesting that the interesting to learn that the the ultimate goal of the main game is the
the same as the tutorial.
14:37
That's fun.
Well, that matches, you know, the, the, the whimsical, cozy core tone of the game, I suppose.
14:43
Yeah, and and so like it.
It does like the very basic tutorial stuff of like this is a card, this is how much it costs.
14:50
It comes out of this mana pool, yes, like things that we've we've seen a dozen times already in
various deck builders and all that stuff.
14:57
But I think it does a good job of like if you've never played a deck builder before, then like, OK,
yeah, it's kind of spelling out all the steps.
15:03
The twist here is mana with color though, So it like the first node you like was.
This Magic the Gathering.
15:13
Never heard it.
Is this Is this MTG?
15:16
No, because it doesn't have the circle of colors.
It only has a couple or wait, actually no.
15:21
How many colors does it have?
Will.
15:23
I believe it's 5.
Oh shit, I just hadn't gotten far enough.
15:27
Wattsy is preparing their legal notice now.
Yeah, that that is a that is A twist, Scott.
15:34
And how do you acquire these these different manas?
Well, depending on the deck that you picked or cards that you acquire, the, the card itself will be
15:45
titled with a, a background that has some kind of color to it.
And you, you, you, I guess you discard that card in order to convert mana in your pool to that
15:54
color.
For the, the 10 people that listen to this podcast that have played Race for the Galaxy, it feels
16:01
very like that.
We're like you're using stuff in your hand to build up like an economy of things to play other cards
16:09
with kind of And so like you're, you're like using stuff out of your hand to pay for things that you
will play also out of your hand, which I thought I thought was a neat twist.
16:19
I'm like, OK, like I can see how this will be interesting.
And then after you've crossbowed this, this pig enemy who I, I love that like some of the enemies
16:31
will have like background sounds to them like as you're playing and this, this like like beefy pig
man who's blocking your path will just like every like 5 or 6 seconds.
16:42
It's disturbingly like accurate.
I found it almost distracting.
16:47
It's like his pig noises are too pig.
It's not just like a guy going.
16:52
It's like it's.
Like they actually got the pig in the studio.
16:56
But yeah, so you you crossbone like six or seven times and you win that victory.
Like, OK, yes, I've learned the lesson on to the next step and that that's where it started.
17:04
That smile, that damn smile meme.
A strange girl approaches and this the the little journal thing that pops up, I think is is a a it
17:14
fits the cozy cuteness vibe of the game very well.
Of you have this little like almost picture book that pops open with like little like hand drawn
17:23
piece of art on one side.
And it's it's an event.
17:25
It's it's your standard event kind of deal.
It says, I met a girl, She says swords and Shields are so boring.
17:32
Try these goodies and gives you a bunch of these purple cards.
And these purple cards are kind of like your dice, your dice base rolling stuff.
17:41
And then the player character says, what the hell is all this?
And I can kind of sympathize.
17:47
So then it kind of goes into the mechanics of multi colored cards that have like a mix of like
purple and Gray or like blue and purple and, and some such things.
17:56
Then you fight the, the, the pig king at the end of this tutorial.
You're like, why is this piggy so strong?
18:03
All of his numbers, all of his attack damage and all this health stuff is like super over the top.
You know, like, oh, like clearly I'm I'm supposed to fail this fight, which is fine.
18:11
Like sometimes tutorials do that but the little message pops up so you won't be able to handle all
this.
18:17
Here's something good for you and it's a a higher detailed version of the girl from before.
It gives you the one dice card that can change any number on the screen and doesn't even give you
18:30
just one.
Gives you maybe like a dozen of them and a a special like cartoon Acme bomb card that does 99 damage
18:39
to the enemy, but also to yourself.
And you can use that as many times.
18:43
So this I feel like this is a good teaching moment of like, OK, are you going to solve this problem?
And I think this for me is where like the light turned on of like I, I hesitate to admit that I lost
18:53
this tutorial for the first time because I didn't know like I, I I have like the one dice camera
like, OK, like what do you mean?
19:02
I can change any number on the screen like any number.
What?
19:07
That doesn't sound right.
Any number yeah, let me just bump up my steam played hours so it looks like I know what I'm talking
19:13
about when I review this game yeah and and there's this cool there's this fun like VHS pause effect
where you know you get like the I don't know the interlacing lines kind of flash up and yeah you.
19:27
Scribbles out.
Indeed, when you do it, it feels.
19:30
Like a very 4th wall break.
Yeah, which I I, I don't know, I think it's integrated well enough, but it's it's it's definitely
19:39
cool.
It's a cool.
19:41
I would calling it a gimmick.
Gimmick is the word.
19:43
I think we.
All I mean, I think it's pretty novel though.
19:47
I think it's.
A gimmick can be novel.
19:49
I mean, that's.
Barely.
19:51
I I think it adds a fair amount to the game.
It should be discounted immediately.
19:57
So, so anyway, you, you, you figure out the puzzle to like, oh, like I reduced the damage of the, of
the grenade.
20:03
I, I use the cards to reduce the enemy's health bars.
Kaboom.
20:07
Like I really love the animation of this grenade where like you hold up this Acme bomb and then it's
like like nesting doll unfurls to like a smaller and smaller dynamite thing and then blows up
20:18
animations.
Top notch in this game.
20:21
But then it's like, oh, I, you know, I saw something purple in the distance and it feels like it's
getting closer and closer.
20:28
It feels wrong.
I better run away from this.
20:30
And instead of going from the right to the left in the tutorial, now you're running from the left to
the right back tracing to the previous nodes that you've gone through to get back to your original
20:41
starter node.
And then the little girl thing pops up again and says, purple fog keeps spreading.
20:51
In the haze, I seem to see things not of this world.
And then in quotes, the world is broken.
20:57
He he the girl appears again beside me.
Because you used that dice card to change the numbers in this world.
21:03
It's quite useful, right?
Otherwise you would have been beaten by the piggy boss.
21:07
If you stay here, you'll be swallowed by the these purple strange things, she says with a smile.
Even though it's a frightening thing, it's escape this world with me and I love like there's this
21:18
weird dichotomy where like the sketch is like this mischievous, like he, he, he, he like very
devilish, like, Oh no, what Faustian bargain have I signed up for?
21:27
And then like literally the next scene is like this very like happy go lucky anime girl.
That's like feeling like, Hey, welcome to my home like this.
21:37
Is the movie lofi?
Lofi anime beats cozy core.
21:41
Exactly.
To roll dice too, yes.
21:43
And she says the the world we left is no more like I can, I can take you to countless almost
identical worlds, however, no matter where you go.
21:52
Dystopian shit here.
Yeah, exactly.
21:54
But you know, there's a, a a a winky face emoji, so why not?
If you can run all the way to the center of the royal city, I'll send you to a world where you can
22:02
have leisurely time to fish.
Good luck.
22:05
And you're just like, all right, well, I'm have been sent to this like weird realm between realms of
dystopian purple mist nightmare and this happy anime girl's like, good luck, pal.
22:18
You know your standard fishing adventure.
Definitely a very wacky and unique concept for a story that you would only see in anime, so that
22:29
that also matches the the tone of the presentation.
So that's nice.
22:33
Interesting.
Well, I obviously should have paid closer attention to the tutorial, which I had to do twice, by the
22:37
way.
And I, I didn't realize that yo-yo, the player caused the mist by taking the dice.
22:45
Oh my gosh, this is that's, that's good stuff.
And that's where I thought like the story for the game was going to be some kind of interesting like
22:54
Lord of the Rings style 1 ring corruption type deal where I'm like, I have this immense power.
I need to like balance this immense power before it.
23:04
Like, like I thought, I literally thought the purple mist was like Frodo's corruption as as you're
trying to like and like, Oh, I'm sure like clearly bringing this purple corruption to the, to the
23:16
center of the city is going to present me with some kind of choice of like, you know, do I, do I
cast the dye into the fire?
23:24
Or do I just turn around and say no and keep it for myself?
That is, perhaps you become the stopper king, the new king, the dice king, the dice, the the true
23:33
diceomancer.
Yeah.
23:36
All right.
Well, that scratches one of the questions I have in my notes off the list.
23:40
What is the purple mist?
Oh, wait, there's a follow up to that.
23:44
Does anyone care about does anyone?
Now that I've heard the storyline again, it's a little intriguing, but it's kind of unfortunate to
23:52
hear that it doesn't really go anywhere.
Yeah, the the purple mist is essentially stolen from FTL or like, I mean, I shouldn't say I mean
23:59
like I appreciate stealing inspired by is inspired by, I mean, I I'll I'll say steal.
I steal the game mechanics for all the time, but this one is just like it doesn't do it doesn't
24:10
really feel like it adds anything to the game.
And I don't think that in FTL that it really did all that much either.
24:16
Like the having the standard like I mean, it's essentially a latest fire map procedurally generated
except for sideways.
24:21
And instead of like always going forward one node, what they did is they allow you to go backwards
and they have nodes that kind of like allow you to extend straight up or straight back to like get
24:31
like just basically get 1-2, maybe three more extra nodes between the start and the finish.
And that all the purple mist does is prevent you from just like going around in a circle and
24:41
collecting every single one.
And so it's just like, why not just like, I don't know, like extend it by like, you know, maybe up
24:49
to three like rungs or, you know, three different levels.
And this like it'll add like a, a jumping mechanic where you can jump from 1:00 to another way.
24:56
Anyone you, I don't know, like they, they, they do that inside this fire with the, the, the, the
shoes, the flying shoes relic.
25:03
And it's just like, yeah, that's essentially doing the same thing.
You're just going to a different place.
25:07
You're still forced to move forward, so you can't really go back.
But like, it's the same you in the end, you're getting the same sort of a feeling.
25:14
And this one just feels, it feels so just bolted on there and it doesn't feel good at all to me,
the.
25:20
FTL map is a lot wider.
Yeah, yeah.
25:25
So like there's definitely times in FTL where you're like, I'm going to backtrack through the like
rebel area because I need to get back and through to the the next stage.
25:37
There's not really like looking at the map in FTL is a lot of like options, a lot of decisions.
There's not really that many decisions.
25:46
It's like, well, I could, I could do this one extra thing.
I.
25:50
Feel like FTL is more of like a web instead of a tree.
Yeah.
25:53
Yeah.
And that's because it's wider.
25:55
I mean, that's the only, I think that's the primary thing here.
If this one was.
25:58
It's a lot wider and then the and the the relative pace of the the Mist or the rebels or whatever
that the threat is slower.
26:07
You can, yeah.
Despite wearing a purple hoodie, I was too timid to venture backwards through the purple mist.
26:15
Like, does the game allow you to go back through the purple mist?
Is there any like consequence of of doing so?
26:20
Has anyone who's ever played this game ever, ever been caught by the purple mist?
I think not because it's that's that's the big problem for me is that it's just it's way too slow
26:31
and it's like never a problem.
So what ascension level are you guys playing on?
26:36
A big fat 0 ascension level.
Right.
26:39
And so this is this is where like, so yes, when you're playing Ascension Zero, you're never going to
get caught.
26:46
But I assume having not actually I play an 8.6 hour, I assume that some of these ascension levels
make it go much faster.
26:52
And so this basically just means that you have to go pretty much in a straight line, which is just
like, oh, then just make it aspire.
26:57
So right, well, that's that's not fun.
Well, I guess interesting like the.
27:01
I guess we don't know for sure.
Let me look at the ascension.
27:03
Levels real quick and also you can you can distort your cards so if you use your one dice to make
permanent changes to your cards then it advances the mist faster but I never ended up doing that.
27:15
You.
Never distorted your cards.
27:16
I mean I did, but not not super often like sometimes I did, but like.
Mistakes you have to get.
27:23
Backtrack like the first love, like you you.
You don't distort your basic cards, you have to like.
27:31
You're not likely to get them to be better.
Well, once you get that that juicy thick D20, then you still have any cards that have like, you
27:41
know, anything less than like a 10 on them.
Then I'm I'm gambling my my my card stability away for it.
27:48
But I think that like one thing that I was surprised about when you distort those cards by changing
the number and like, then you use the card, it advances the purple mist.
27:57
It advances it by like a pixel or something.
I was picturing it that it was going to advance it like a full step and I was like, I was very like
28:04
wary at first.
So I'm like, man, do I really want to advance the rebel fleet that much for using this card?
28:09
And it was like this like big dilemma in my head.
I'm like, all right, well, I guess I gotta in order to beat beat this fight, play the card and then
28:15
it like I'm like, did it actually move like am I crazy?
And I had to take like a screenshot and zoom in and it it does move it by like a hair.
28:26
I'm sure there's things that like, you know, like higher value cards that move it further.
Or if if you have like an insanely broken deck and you are playing like, you know, 150 cards in a
28:38
row that do advance it, then I'm sure that scales the advancement factor a lot.
But at least in my, you know, playing it, it didn't seem super consequential.
28:50
And yeah, I don't, I don't fully agree with all the concerns over the purple mist being brought up.
However, yeah, it it it's it's unfortunately takes a lot of it takes a lot of the oomph out of it
29:02
when it's seemingly not super.
It wasn't much of A concern really for my full like six hours.
29:09
So I don't know, let's maybe assume that it what what have you found in your research Will.
There's basically not a wiki.
29:17
I don't really see anything that describes the essential levels at this point.
Well, let's.
29:21
Just there is a wiki.
The benefit of the doubt that.
29:24
There is a wiki.
It's all in Chinese though.
29:26
Oh.
That's what that was, OK.
29:29
Google auto translate for me.
Chinese thank God for the the auto translate feature.
29:35
But I can't.
I don't know if this is the same game Dice Wander.
29:39
No, it says Dice Daisomancer dot Fuji wiki.
Yeah, I think, I think which.
29:44
Iteration of Chinese, but but hey, I'm glad you're bringing up Chinese the concept of different
languages other than the one that we have here because at the translation.
29:57
So we we previously played a game that was translated and it was also a card game, which was called
space fight.
30:04
It was called 3 rail space shooting star called Lone Star.
Thank you.
30:08
Lone Star, it's called.
Laser space fight.
30:10
I don't know if I play space fight.
Space Fight developed by Purple Robe Games.
30:18
All right, so in that game there were some kind of major translation issues and that some of the
stuff didn't make sense mechanically.
30:27
The the mechanical terms terminology was not crystal clear, far from crystal clear.
Now with this game, I, I feel like it has a pretty good, pretty good localization, pretty good
30:37
translation, except for when it comes to the name of some of the enemies.
I, I think perhaps I have a theory that perhaps somebody's having a little bit of a laugh.
30:50
Someone's pulling the hood winking, if you will, purple hood winking the development team, because
there's some suggestive enemy names here.
31:02
I mean, first of all, not to disparage past guest of the show, but there, there is a character made
of wood named Woody.
31:09
And then he got one guy just named Willie.
You got a a throat wolf?
31:13
What?
What's a throat wolf?
31:16
The Bush warrior.
And then also we got shroom head, which might as well be mushroom tip.
31:21
Am I right, fellas?
Daissomancer.
31:23
More like dickomancer.
I hate to say it, but somebody's got to.
31:27
Yeah, I wasn't going to be the one to say it because I didn't notice that, but it.
Wasn't going to be the one to stick on their mind it sounds like.
31:34
This sounds like more of an Andrew thing then.
I wasn't going to say it because nobody else would ever have picked up on that.
31:42
Hey, look, at a certain point in time, once I, when I once I was like 30 hours into playing like
Nuita this week, 30 additional hours.
31:47
I'm like, you know, I got to come up with some content for the podcast.
I know penis jokes great, but what do we?
31:55
But seriously, what do we think about the the the translation?
I I thought I thought it was good and in fact I forgot garbage was a Chinese game.
32:03
I don't know what Scott's talking about.
I think no, go ahead.
32:07
I didn't realize it was a translated game, so it obviously couldn't have been that bad.
Now there are a lot of effects where you're like, OK, what is going to happen next?
32:14
I want to plan this all out.
Let me mouse over check out what his like the intent is all right, this is going to trigger when
32:20
this thing happens.
But unless this happens and it was just like I remember many times just being like, I have no idea
32:26
what is about to happen And like you have to just kind of experience like that's what this effect
means.
32:32
Like if you.
I don't think that was translation issue, I think that was just.
32:37
That's not a real issue.
No.
32:39
I mean it's.
Just a game.
32:41
Experience the.
Diversity of characters and effects.
32:43
It's a rule book issue.
It's like it's.
32:46
It's like when board games have like extremely verbose rule books.
And you're I've played many, many games that have been written in English that are also hard to
32:54
understand what's going to happen.
If you do the thing got you, got you, you, you suspect that it was just poorly written to begin
33:00
with, and therefore the translation didn't have a chance.
That could very well be.
33:04
Yeah, sure.
For sure, for sure.
33:06
I feel like the for the most part, the like the OR like the logistics of like how different effects
proc other effects definitely felt a little overwhelming.
33:24
And like I, I thought that there was like I was happy that there was like a lot of stuff happening,
but it felt like there was a lot of stuff that I had to like read and learn and internalize in order
33:37
to understand what was happening.
Where like first couple like when like Will had said that, Oh, he's like, he's beaten this game
33:46
already so fast.
I'm like, oh, well then like it has to be like super easy to play right?
33:50
And then I was going through.
What you would think because will could beat it.
33:53
Interesting.
OK.
33:55
Well, I mean, you know, the, the king of rogue like deck builders, you know, so it was so well
trained.
34:03
You know, I, I was thinking like, OK, well, surely you know, it, it should be relatively
straightforward to, to come to terms with.
34:11
And I feel like on the spectrum between like, like sleigh the Spire is like is very straightforward
about like this thing does this thing and it doesn't have like like walls of text to, to kind of
34:21
parse through slice and dice.
I feel like is, is maybe kind of creeping up there in terms of cognitive load.
34:28
And then I don't, I don't really remember like Monster Train at all in terms of like like how how
much cognitive load there is for stuff.
34:35
But I remember it being on the pretty low end of the spectrum.
Monster training is easy to figure out what each individual card do, card do what the card do, but I
34:46
feel like the the difficulty then is in trying to figure out how the interactions are going to like
scale.
34:53
Well, I mean, yeah.
And they in monster trend, they tell you what the what's going to happen by the end.
34:57
And so they they'll tell you like if you just end the turn right now, this is how much damage
everyone's going to take.
35:01
And so it reduces the cognitive load in a good way.
Slavis bar does not do that.
35:05
But what I at the cost of like you have to still calculate.
All right, well, these characters are going to move up here and then attack.
35:11
And so you have to figure out a ways to like mitigating the moving through the levels.
That's kind of where the cognitive load is.
35:18
So this game could not do that because of what I'm gonna help go ahead and say is my biggest
critique of this game is it has dice in it.
35:27
Yep.
Oh nice.
35:29
Or I for for someone who likes D and DA lot.
I hate dice.
35:34
Well, let me ask you this.
Oh.
35:35
Man coming down hard.
So so Colin, you've played slice and dice on your phone like a, a a number of times since we've done
35:43
that episode.
Yes, that that game is nothing but dice Is is the issue here that it's the combination of yes, dice
35:52
rolling and card drawing?
It's two separate sources of randomness where like you need some amount of randomness and you need
36:02
some ways to mitigate that randomness.
Slice and dice has something where you know you roll the dice and then you can re roll some of it
36:08
and you can do some things and it's scaled around that pretty well.
Deck builder slice Spire type games.
36:17
I feel like each turn is a little mini puzzle and this didn't it made it too hard to solve the
puzzle like I I didn't like, I don't like when it's you roll the dice and maybe you'll you'll kill
36:31
this thing, maybe you won't.
And a lot of the cards synergize off of like getting down their individual hit bars.
36:39
And so it's like, well, if I roll A3 or above, I'm perfectly fine.
And if I don't roll A3 or above, I'm super screwed.
36:48
And that happens a lot.
And it's just like a hard to predict what's going to happen once you click the enter button.
36:54
You know what?
You know what it is?
36:55
We've all played XCOM.
Yeah, I was about to bring that up.
36:58
You have the same critique of XCOM.
Yeah, I think so.
37:01
I mean, I, I, I don't, I don't think that this sort of like percent chance essentially like if you
got a shotgun and you're on tile away from the alien and there's no cover and you have a 95% chance
37:13
of blasting him.
You see the animation, you put the gun directly against his head and then you pull the trigger.
37:18
You and you when you lose that, that makes you enraged.
And then the enraging side of that is not balanced by the oh, you have a 5% chance to win.
37:27
Oh, I got it.
Yay.
37:29
Because you expect that to fail and just in the way that you expect that to succeed.
And so when you get the oh man, it's just it hurts so much more when you fail for these random
37:38
checks, then when you succeed, then the good feeling for succeeding and so.
But but then we wouldn't have that cathartic moment of like the the meme existing and us being able
37:49
to laugh about the meme right?
And the gun up right in front of the alien's head. 95% chance.
37:54
Exactly.
Been there, we've all experienced.
37:57
Same thing in, like Fallout, you know, the 3D Fallouts with the bat system, you know, all sorts of
comedy gold we'd be deprived of.
38:04
I mean, I don't know what what are what are we to say?
You and I, Scott?
38:08
Like, no, you're you're wrong.
Randomness is is is very important.
38:12
Like I I yeah, I get it.
Like, it's it's this will be for some people.
38:15
It won't be for us.
Randomness.
38:17
Is this type of game?
Randomness is important.
38:20
I mean, I still very much believe that to be the case.
And so, but like there's different forms of randomness and some of them are more fun than others.
38:27
And So what I mean is like when you're drawing cards from a deck where you're like curating the
deck, it feels like you have you, you've affected the what you're about to see.
38:36
Whereas so like the five cards you draw or whatever comes from the deck that you've curated to some
degree.
38:40
So you kind of get a sense of what's going into it, but like a dice roll, like you're just throwing
that and it's just like you have no control over what you just, it feels like you're just tossing it
38:49
to the wind.
And so that kind of randomness, it sucks.
38:52
Well, all my decks are so lousy that I, I need the help of just getting lucky and throwing a random
dice.
38:58
So similarly with Bilatro.
Bilatro doesn't give you, you know, a clear readout of like what the final result is going to be.
39:07
I mean, we, I, I'm sort of disgusted.
We discussed it during the episode, but remind me, But do we think Belatro would be better without
39:14
any of those roles and those random chances?
What I mean, the only roles that I I mean, yeah, the roles are like.
39:21
Are there certain jokers that it's like it could be, could be this number, it could be that number.
I mean, there's a couple, but it's not like a a large part of the game, I think.
39:29
I think like Belatro doesn't tell you what the final number is going to be.
And that doesn't mean that you're that's where the cognitive load exists is that you have to kind of
39:38
like get a sense of what all of your numbers like end up being.
Cognitive Load, another release coming from Purple Robe Games.
39:49
One game that we.
Also could be a Dick joke.
39:52
I I I hesitate to call it like a a dice builder, maybe more of a bag builder.
Luck be a landlord definitely has like it is randomness colon the game, but it is also like
40:03
randomness mitigation colon the game and I feel like.
Bilatro to some extent has like, the more that I've learned about it since we've done that episode,
40:13
the more I've come to appreciate its mechanics of like, OK, yeah, it like, it is.
You do have a lot more authority around your strategy.
40:21
It's just coming at it from like a completely different angle and with what the landlord, it's like,
oh, you have a lot of ways to, like, mill your deck.
40:30
And if you do have ways to like kind of mill your deck here in Dysomancer, like you do have the very
standard like cut the card into and it's a very satisfying like split of like the card.
40:41
There are, I guess, like I don't, you're kind of deck milling by by using the one die on your your
deck and like your your energy management and things like that.
40:54
And where was I going with this?
Oh so like lucky landlord, very good at randomness mitigation.
40:59
One game that we haven't talked about yet, a very possible stay tuned that I think kind of does two
sources of randomness, but very good at randomness mitigation is Astraya 6 sided oracles, which is
41:13
you could probably guess from the name dice.
But it's like you're it's like a dice builder in that like you, you know, you roll the dice you have
41:21
like, I don't know 5 dice or something, but and there's this interesting corruption mechanic to it
that the more corrupt you become like you'll you'll take like health point damage, but the more
41:31
corruption you take, the more options you have for like randomness mitigation.
So it's this very interesting, like push pull dynamic balance of like, yeah, OK, like this thing is
41:43
random, but oh, do I want to like run the risk of like damaging my player character by rerolling it.
And so to some degree, Slice and Dice also has that mechanic, but right, yeah, more more sort of
41:54
spread out among the characters that you have.
I think so.
41:58
So the way that the the one dice roll works is you build up points for each stage that you go
through.
42:04
And so you can't just use that dice every single time.
I think it would be a more interesting game if those were used to re roll the dice if somehow, or
42:16
maybe it was slightly less powerful and it's like, OK, you build up these points to re roll the dice
and you're like you get one or two rolls of it.
42:25
Re roll one dice though.
The one dice so say you're you're I'm, I'm trying to reload my thing.
42:31
I want it to reload it from zero to 6 or whatever and I roll A1 or like I, I want to improve this
card.
42:40
It normally does.
Like there's a card that does 0 damage 8 times and you can use the one dice on it so that it does
42:49
between 1:00 and 6:00 damage eight times.
And I rolled A1 and I was like, that sucks that this was an awesome card and it would would
42:57
synergize super well with my deck.
And now it's only going to a little bit synergize with my deck.
43:03
But so you're saying use the use the one die to make the change and then use the one die as again.
So you're just talking about re rolling?
43:11
I got maybe some bad news for you Colin, and, and forgive me if this is offensive, but, but are you
aware that there's the one dice card, but then there's also the one dice relic up in the top left
43:22
hand corner that you can use multiple times and you can just keep doing it if you don't desire so
great news.
43:30
This mechanic you're describing already in the game.
I only discovered it like recently also.
43:37
I.
Feel for you.
43:39
Yeah, so key, so key difference here between wow.
OK, so I didn't, I, I mean, I, I knew about activated effects.
43:47
I knew like, Oh yeah, you there's the one dice thing and then underneath it are the activated
effects.
43:51
I've never clicked on that because.
I don't think they make it clear in the tutorial and and I've played the tutorial twice and deluded.
0:00
Me.
43:59
OK, well now I feel like I really don't know if I like this game or not.
That is a really it.
44:06
Is a randomness.
I can see why you wouldn't you haven't beat the game because that that actually is like a very
44:14
powerful mechanic.
Like in fact, the only the primary way you use that the the the die when you have not just the one
44:19
that you draw in from the deck and that exhaust itself.
But when you bank up like 40 of these things and there's like abilities to like double it along the
44:26
way, you'll just end up banking up and then you get to like a mini boss or the boss and they'll have
and this is the jink.
44:31
This I I really hate this element.
The way that they prevent you from being extremely overpowered forward with this re rolling anything
44:40
is they separate health bars up into tiny little health bars.
So instead of having one pool of health, there's like 10 pools of like, you know, a certain amount
44:49
of health.
And that way you have to spend 10 rolls of that dye in order to reduce that health from like, here's
44:54
20 in this health bar down to, you know, zero, you know, one to six or one that you can upgrade it 1
to 20 in some cases.
45:00
But like, it's just like, yeah, that's all you're doing is you're using that dye to reduce those
things and then to improve the things on your cards where the values are 1-2 and three essentially.
45:09
Or maybe eventually, once you improve the dye, like you might want to risk it for something that's,
you know, more, but like that's it.
45:15
Like that's that's basically the whole gimmick.
And then once you get that, you just save up the dye, you use it on bosses to reduce their health,
45:22
and then occasionally on your own cards, like it's just like, OK, like.
You can.
45:26
You can also use the dice on your energy pool, which is.
Yeah, you can use.
45:30
The dice on your energy pool.
You can use the dice on your dice.
45:33
But.
If you have one die left, you can already have two for a charge I guess.
45:37
But if you use that on your die, you can suddenly have 6 charges.
And so you can just like have that like feed into itself.
45:43
And so, yeah, of course.
I didn't think to do that.
45:46
See, I think again, I think it transcends a gimmick.
I think.
45:49
I think the one dice thing is pretty I.
Just have to like drop off the podcast because I feel like I didn't actually play this game.
45:55
Again I I didn't like notice until like maybe it might have been as recently as today but yeah for
like 3 hours didn't had no idea.
46:06
And yeah, no wonder I was getting my butt kicked by every mini boss.
I don't know if I ever would have clicked it.
46:12
I think I would have just continued.
Well, I mean, basically I just kept banging my head against a wall and thinking that it had like,
46:19
there are so many things that synergize with that that I was just like, I don't really understand
how this is a good strategy.
46:26
Like there's a bunch of cards that, yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
Like these don't scale.
46:31
They don't synergize.
They don't have any like potential.
46:34
They're just like bad cards.
It's because and I was like, oh man, it's so hard like this would be good if I could somehow manage
46:41
to like draw both the one dice and this car at the same time.
But I already used it so.
46:46
Ah, shucks, yeah, right.
Indeed.
46:48
Well, it happened to two of us.
So hey, you know, maybe in the next update I should consider a little tool tip that just pops up and
46:56
is like, hey, you know, you haven't used your relic in a while.
Don't don't forget that.
47:00
Part of the localization I also didn't these these these charges really build up quickly.
Like even though I'm using the like also, that was the other thing.
47:09
So I thought it used those charges whenever you rolled the one dice.
So there would be many times where I wouldn't use it.
47:15
And you know, maybe that that one is more on me.
I never noticed the number going down.
47:19
I just assumed that it did.
No, I I feel for you.
47:23
I feel for you, I think.
Coming back to the to the health bar thing, I don't, I can't.
47:28
Yeah, what's the alternative?
Well, yeah, I can't think of a better way to balance it because clearly like in this, I hesitate to
47:34
call it a gimmick because I I my gut instinct is that it's it's more complex than that.
But like in this game world of like any number on the screen can be re rolled that yeah, I mean,
47:47
obviously like the the cheese strategy, just re roll the HP bar and then like one shot them.
And unless like all of like unless there's some kind of, you know, when you use the one dye, there's
47:59
like a corruption mechanic or the the purple mist spreads at an alarming rate.
And then like, oh, there's like there's a danger to doing that.
48:08
Then like, yeah, obviously I'm just gonna like whittle them down to 1 HP or like go from like have
their HP bars go from like 80 down to let's say even 20 and making the fight substantially easier.
48:20
Like there's not like that substantial of a trade off of doing so, but I can't think of a better way
of balancing it other than, yeah, just like segmenting up the HP bars or making the purple purple
48:32
mist go faster.
Well, that's the thing.
48:33
It's like you can see it clearly as a this is their way of dealing with like the gimmick because
otherwise the gimmick breaks the game.
48:41
And so it feels it doesn't like just having a bunch of health bars like all together representing
their total health.
48:48
Like, I don't know, like that might make sense if there was like arms and legs and you could blow
off an arm and blow off a leg.
48:53
But it's just like, no, it's just like.
You know what they should have done?
48:57
They should have had the health pools all be separate.
Little dice like.
49:03
What do you?
Mean like this.
49:05
This monster has 8D20 health that rolls all the numbers add up and then you like chip away at each
one or.
49:14
Like an actual DND stat block.
Yeah.
49:16
You're actually bringing up a good point here because the way that another gimmicky way that they
get around change every number on the screen is some numbers are just icons.
49:26
And so like, you know, 2 energy would be like 2, you know, an icon for two energy.
So you can't like make that change and like certain things that they don't want you to fuck with.
49:35
They just like write, you know the words out or they give you icons and so.
It's just like, no, I like that.
49:40
I think it's a, you know, it like if you, unless you want this gimmick to be like the whole game and
nothing else, like there's no way that you can get around the other ways that you can get around
49:52
this, I think would be worse.
Be like, OK, rather than having one big boss, you have like a million tiny minions and then you
50:00
can't and then you have no AOE ever because you can't have that.
Like I, I think that you need some way of if, if you want this to be like a large part of your game,
50:08
you need ways to have it like tweak so that it's not every.
Part of your game.
50:14
I got a solution real simple.
No dice.
50:16
Change the name of the game.
Oh.
50:17
Man, oh man, and and it's an Irish game now.
Well, no.
50:21
And then I mean, there's just so many other things I would say like on top of this, like get rid of
all the bad stuff and the bad stuff includes like the dice.
50:27
I don't, I think the dice is stupid.
The bad stuff includes the the class selection.
50:32
The class selection is something I got a big, I got a big problem with it because yeah, so all the
colors are like for the archetype of this, they all the colors are related to this.
50:44
And so when you're choosing like you, you choose three orbs essentially out of five different
colors.
50:48
And the orbs are different colors and then you put them all together and that gives you a class.
And the class has its like its own kind of like base relic sort of effect.
50:57
But what that means is that everything is just essentially you're, you're given the like, yes, if
you want the powerful deck, use this archetype and like it becomes a strategy where it's like, oh,
51:08
get rid of all the like, if you have three colors, the best strategy is to get rid of the other
colors and just focus on one color.
51:16
And that's like the big problem is that they tell you exactly what the archetypes are instead of
let's say a great game like Slate Aspire where it's like there's not color coding where it tells
51:24
you, yeah, all these things go together.
You just have to experiment and find that out for yourselves.
51:29
Whereas the blue deck, it's just like, oh, it's all these reload things and here's some bonuses for
reload.
51:35
And just like the synergy is so strong.
So the orb, so the orbs are not analogous to Slay the Spire starting characters.
51:41
That's kind of what I got the vibe of.
No, they, they, they're just like they are.
51:45
This is these are the, this is the pool of cards that you will get is essentially what that decides
so well for all the cards that you have unlocked in each of those pools, it groups them all together
51:55
and it's just like, all right, there you go.
And so the strategy because of the meta progression is such a big part of this game is like, yeah, a
52:01
lot of the Nos that you get in this kind of a tree research thing, which we can talk about is like,
yeah, this will add 3 cards to your deck.
52:07
But like if those cards are bad or if you know that, like you know which ones to avoid because you
played the game before, you might be like, yeah, actually, I want to see my deck very tight and I'm
52:14
only going to expand this one archetype down this path.
Then it's just like that is the most powerful build.
52:19
You just keep doing that over and over again and you just like you just win.
And that's, that was my, my, I did the blue deck three times in a row.
52:26
It was super reliable, always got the things that made it work because the deck is so small in the
beginning and it's just like, why would I want to add more cards?
52:34
I mean, it's just like, this is already like just dominating.
And it's as simple as that, folks.
52:39
That is in the three easy, simple steps to success in Dysomancer as presented by what?
Well, I don't know enough about the inner workings and the mechanics of this game to to argue it.
52:50
It's that sounds like a a pretty a very fair thank you.
An accurate analysis that yeah, you're not that you're you're incentivized to only only follow, you
53:02
know, 11 particular upgrade tree.
I don't think you can get rid of the dice though, if there's no dice in this.
53:09
If there's no dice in this game, it's just a worse slate of Spire.
Just I mean I am turning it into the slate of Spire.
53:15
What I'm saying, what I want to say is like emits on the thing that you're doing, like the first
person elements.
53:20
I mean, like, I don't, I don't exactly know.
I can't not going to design your game for you.
53:24
I've already got, you know, I've got the I'm already busy with that.
But make it, make it your own somehow.
53:29
Like take Slay the Spire as a base game, pull some stuff.
Out dice in the bottle it's.
53:34
I feel like they're already following your advice.
Slay the dice.
53:37
Dice the Spire.
I mean, there's a, there's an acronym, I forgot it was ECCG or it's like you want to eliminate
53:44
something, you want to create something, you want to reduce something and you want to increase.
I don't, I don't remember the exact.
53:52
This is all from like business strategy thing.
But like that is a strategy for building products.
53:57
Like makes a lot of sense in the in the context of, I think turning this latest buyer into your own
thing.
54:01
Boo business Boo.
Well, I, I like the dice, but again, I, I admit that that that type of that extra random element is
54:09
not going to be for everybody.
My beef with the class system is that I don't like the sage.
54:15
I don't understand the sage.
I don't know what's going on with the sage guy.
54:19
Why is the sage?
Why is he armed to the teeth?
54:22
Yeah, why was the sages think guns and crossbows and I've.
Got some sagely advice for you right here.
54:29
All six cylinders, I mean a cylinder of six shots.
So I was stinking really bad and having not a good time banging my head against the wall.
54:38
Part of the reason was because I wasn't using the dice mechanic at the top left hand corner.
But once I got the Berserk deck, I loved the Berserk deck.
54:46
What do you what did you all have a chance to play?
I played around with it for a little bit and I did get a a reasonably broken combo going that I
54:53
thought, OK, like I can see, I can see the appeal here.
Where like once you once you get that broken combo going and it just starts kind of taking off like,
55:02
yeah, like that felt super satisfying.
It ran out of steam eventually just cuz I I like biffed it and like rolled like ones and I didn't
55:10
really understand what I was doing at the time.
It rolled ones and that.
55:12
That felt really good though.
That was Oh yeah, definitely.
55:14
And that was a good experience.
And other people were able to to laugh at my misfortune, which made it all the worthwhile.
55:21
And yeah, like, I could see how that was interesting.
I played around with the green deck.
55:25
Some didn't think that that was as interesting, but only did it once.
And yeah, I think like I can kind of like Echo will sentiment a little bit of like, I wish I wasn't
55:37
like so boxed in with like the initial starting classes as they were.
Like you're presented with with five orbs and three slots.
55:46
And the combinatorics should be like, well, you should have 10 different classes like, but you're
restricted.
55:53
I don't know if this is part of a meta progression unlock, but like, you're restricted with like the
purple and the Gray orb and you can only flip out the blue or like red or green ones to start with.
56:04
But yeah, I mean, I thought that those three classes were distinct enough in their play styles to
make it at least interesting.
56:13
You can switch out eventually.
You have to keep the purple orb no matter what.
56:16
But you can switch out the eventually, like once you progress, once you go down the meta progression
far enough, then you can start to remove some of the other orbs and so.
56:24
Yeah, you can.
You can have like purple and blue and red.
56:27
Well, you can say you can remove if I recall.
I don't think.
56:30
You can remove purple.
Actually, you never, I didn't get quite to the end of it.
56:32
I assumed you could cause eventually once you get down the meta progression far enough, you can
remove like one of the second orbs or whatever.
56:38
But like, I think my my hunch would be because that was like a central orb and that last one seemed
like, Oh yeah, probably can remove it.
56:45
I'm I'm I'm looking at the various classes or whatever and there's nothing that seems to suggest
that you can remove the purple orb, which which case it shouldn't exist like it should.
56:56
Why have it in there and you can drag it and it says you can't do that.
It's like, oh, that's.
57:00
Because it's just corrupted by the purple orb's power.
And until you can get to the central city and and cast that dye into the fire, you'll.
57:10
Cast your fishing rod your line.
Yeah, at.
57:15
Least you have a.
Purple one, no matter.
57:16
What like so so the rest of us never were not quite as ascension 20 get good scrub skilled as as
will was to get to like the final boss of so like your your your act one, your act two, act three
57:31
kind of structure.
You're you're going from the plains.
57:33
That's kind of like the the Biome that we were talking about in the tutorial.
Then you go into the forest where Woody and the mushroom people attack.
57:41
Very good art and vibes there.
Then you go to the city, you get to the city gates and it's a very like medieval Zelda kind of kind
57:51
of vibe to it.
But like the creatures in the city are just like what?
57:56
What sort of just like weird nightmare have I stumbled upon where like, yes, like I understand what
a drooling wolf is.
58:05
I can understand a a ninja squirrel who's blind in one eye.
Makes perfect sense.
58:10
You see it in fairy tales all the time.
What the hell is this trope?
58:15
And and yeah, you have the classic trope of the weird amalgamation of like strange furniture
creatures that have like amalgamated together.
58:25
I think like I've I've only gotten to the city once and the creatures that I encountered there were
substantially different and bizarre to the rest of the game.
58:34
Will do.
You haven't much much clicked down on that.
58:37
I don't remember any of them.
I mean, I, I, I played it like the first week and then I'm like, OK, I got it and I stopped.
58:44
And so I can't really recall anything in the city.
I remember like the I remember the end boss somewhat and there might be multiple ones but like I I
58:51
can't recall.
Cuz the end boss, if I remember from my scrolling through YouTube speedrun videos, is like, is it?
58:59
Is it like you're literally breaking the 4th wall of the game?
I remember there's being like a transparent like crack in the fabric of the universe that you're
59:06
fighting or something.
I don't remember that particular aspect.
59:10
I just remember that the main, the main big difference is that instead of its health bar being like
something where you have to work it down, you actually once it gets up to 1000, like essentially
59:19
health, that's when it dies.
And so you're going from essential, you know, nothing up to 1000.
59:24
So this way it completely like turns your like use your dice to reduce their HP mechanic on its head
and instead you just have to do a lot of damage.
59:32
Interesting.
Sounds pretty wild.
59:34
Well I mean you guys love this, you know, weird meta 4th wall breaking crap like in inscription.
So it sounds like it's all right up your alley.
59:45
No, I did get to the town, but I, I don't know, it sounds kind of wacky and, and, and far out.
Amalgamation of chairs, you say?
59:55
I mean, like the the enemies from, from Act 3 felt super different and interesting.
Like like I, I felt like I was progressing through some kind of interesting narrative.
1:00:06
But when it felt really bad to lose in this game, and that's something that I think like weighs
pretty heavily against it.
1:00:13
We're like.
You know, previous episode Noida, You know, like you, you just, like, turn around the corner and you
1:00:19
are just immediately dead for seemingly no reason.
You're like, OK, I'm not entirely sure what happened there.
1:00:25
I'm very interested in starting a new run almost immediately, though, because there's all sorts of
wild nonsense that I can get up to in less than two minutes.
1:00:34
It feels like in this game, the ramp up to getting to that wild nonsense takes too long.
And I know that like there's there's a supreme amount of that wild nonsense because there's a lot of
1:00:46
people hunting for that beat the game in less than 30 minute speed run achievement.
I guess like so like will Colin, when you guys are playing sleigh aspire, how long does like an
1:00:57
average?
Like I just want to like cruise through just like beat it no problem.
1:01:01
Like ascension zero run take like 20-30 minutes.
Well, I mean, it depends on how.
1:01:06
I mean, I'd say like 40 minutes on average if you're going to beat the heart.
How about a non heart run A?
1:01:11
Little less than that.
OK.
1:01:13
And, and like for Monster Train also like that, I feel like Monster Train is maybe a little bit
faster.
1:01:19
It feels a lot faster, but it feels like if you lose in Monster Train, it's like, oh, like I can get
back up to that nonsense ramp pretty quickly.
1:01:28
Yeah.
Likewise with like slice or slice and dice and like luck be a landlord or something for this.
1:01:33
One, I mean monster train, especially like the scaling is really fast.
So like you, you don't maybe not got you're not getting back to where you were when you lost, but
1:01:44
you feel like you're getting better quickly.
You don't feel the sense of like, my deck sucks.
1:01:50
Yeah, and I, I feel like there's there are there was the the the one quote, the build that will
educate us about with the the sage where you get a bunch of cards that have the reload mechanic, you
1:02:04
get the reload gun or gun card and then that like builds up this busted synergy.
There's there's another one with the the the bats handy card and beacon that triggers these miracle
1:02:18
effects just like, oh, if like if you happen to draw the card, it it triggers something.
It feels like the the mechanics of the cards are just like slightly too similar to how they operate
1:02:30
and slay the Spire.
Like I I get that they're trying to go for something different but it feels like I don't know just
1:02:37
like too close to Spire ISM maybe am I wrong?
Like monster train feels very different but I felt.
1:02:43
Like the reload, I mean, there's no reloading mechanic in a slate of Spire where like once you spend
it, you have to spend a turn like reloading it.
1:02:52
So that I mean, I have to give him credit like that is a new novel idea, which I think is
interesting.
1:02:56
And like you can, I can very easily imagine that being like in like a downfall in which is the
another dealer, a mod for Slate of Spire.
1:03:04
This could be like another sort of like character based on reload mode.
So I do think it's an that at least that particular one is an interesting archetype.
1:03:11
And I think there there's a bunch of others I didn't explore because again, I'm just, I think on 1/4
gameplay I had to save like halfway through and then I opened it up the next day and I'm just like,
1:03:20
I, I, it hurt me and I'm like, Oh, I have no interest in doing this.
And so I just didn't play the other, you know, play styles, but that's not.
1:03:29
A good sign for the game, yeah.
It just didn't didn't grab me whereas.
1:03:33
I I have a big question.
The map the FTLL style node map.
1:03:39
Are the nodes the same every time?
Is the like the structure of the map the same every time?
1:03:44
Am I crazy?
But between acts, like the acts have similar structures and so like the, the city, for instance, has
1:03:49
like a structure where there's like a bunch of straight lines that are really long.
And so that one's the one that's encouraging to go like really far out and then backtrack a little.
1:03:57
And like you get a little bit more of like a, a reason to backtrack and do other things and play
around with the the fog more.
1:04:03
But yeah, it is randomized every time.
Well, because I remember seeing the ACT 1 like node map structure and it, it's very kind of like
1:04:11
normal.
And then like in the middle chunk, there's like a, a sector that you can like maybe do more of like
1:04:18
a circle in it's.
Procedurally generated with like those kind of like dynamics included.
1:04:22
Just like how insulate the Spire, you don't see an elite until the at least the fifth level and you
don't get repeats of like campfires.
1:04:30
And so there's a lot of rules that they're using to generate it, but it is generated.
Yeah, I I like it looked suspiciously similar like every every time on act one room.
1:04:39
Like this isn't just the same like like the structure, like the the nodes on the tree are different,
sure, but it seemed very suspiciously similar, maybe a little too similar between cause like all the
1:04:54
ones for FTL are like sometimes like alarmingly bad with how different they are, like getting you
boxed into a corner with a whole bunch of nebulas and stuff.
1:05:03
But it is different.
It's very obviously very visually different.
1:05:08
It might be more narrow like like Slate Aspire is a 7 by 15 grid.
Of course, of course, I mean like as everyone knows.
1:05:16
And so like this one, I feel like it might be like 5.
It's a beautiful thing.
1:05:21
So I'm not sure exactly but it feels like.
Slim.
1:05:24
Yeah, it feels a little slimmer.
I could do that.
1:05:27
Well, I, I have a big question too about this.
What So for, you know, hey, everybody's playing Milatro.
1:05:35
Tons of people are being introduced to deck builders for the first time.
Where?
1:05:39
Where do we rank this game?
In terms of how likely would any of us be to recommend this to someone who has played Milatro and
1:05:48
now they want to stretch their wings and they want to try some more deck builders?
I would almost suggest this as some like to play this before playing.
1:05:58
I I, I think this is a really good gateway game into rogue like deck builders because like, well,
like gateway in the sense that like cute art style, like gives you the kind of like general sense as
1:06:11
to like, oh, like, you know, here's how to like deal with randomness and stuff.
And yeah, if like you discover a broken build, you can like run pretty far with it.
1:06:19
I don't know that I would say like, like 100% all the achievements in this game first before jumping
to any other one.
1:06:26
But if you've never played one before and you're like, oh, this has like a very appealing.
I like, I could see this doing very well on the Nintendo Switch with like a very like a broad kind
1:06:37
of like audience appeal to it.
It's very cute it you know.
1:06:42
I don't know if it'd be a better game, but I think it might be an easier sell.
Sure, yeah.
1:06:49
But yeah, if I if I had to like no one's played a rogue like deck builder before, if I had to
recommend as their first experience this or Monster Train, I would maybe lean this, even though I
1:06:59
think Monster Train's the much better game.
I mean, like, I mean, that's a strange situation where you can only recommend one of those two
1:07:05
because we all know the only game we should recommend at least as a first game, which is the you're.
Right slice and dice the objectively best.
1:07:14
I mean, it's a good, that's a good game, but no, it's not the.
One, I mean, there's other factors here though.
1:07:20
Let's assume that there is a less than 100% chance that your recommendation will be heated.
Say I think that you like Slate.
1:07:31
Aspire looks like a a more hardcore game.
I'm going to read you guys a quote.
1:07:36
This is a this is a message I got from someone this morning.
This is someone that I think we're we're chatting in some kind of a subreddit about roguelike games.
0:00
And we just ended up having an actual conversation via webcam once.
1:07:48
And so I said, I told him, Hey, you, you should play Slay the Spire.
That's of course, because that's what I recommend to everyone.
1:07:54
And so his and this is an exact quote.
So I've spent a good chunk of time messing around with Slay the Spire one.
1:08:00
It's awesome. 2.
I can totally see how it's an incredible model for what you're building because it's really into a
1:08:05
different game that I'm building.
But like it's everyone who plays it loves it without exception.
1:08:12
Right, but wouldn't if if no one like take take this as a as a fork to that?
If someone has never played a tabletop board game before, would you recommend them chess or Go to
1:08:24
start?
Or would you recommend them like a cutesified version of checkers?
1:08:28
Oh, I'm not gonna be allowed.
Yeah, play some shoots and ladders.
1:08:31
That'll get you No play a fun game.
Yeah, chess.
1:08:35
I mean, sure, that's a that's AI mean that's a fun game.
And as long as you have the someone that's at your level, then it it's extraordinarily fun if you
1:08:42
have you're trying to play.
AGMI would not recommend any of those games.
1:08:45
I'd recommend a real board game, yeah.
I mean, I would too, but what's a what's a real board game, Theo?
1:08:52
Terrifying me, Mars.
Blue gloomy being Dungeons and Dragons clue.
1:08:59
Anything.
Maybe forms of battle?
1:09:00
For what is it?
Battle for North Africa can't pay.
1:09:02
For North Africa.
Can't pay for North Africa.
1:09:04
Yeah, that's.
A bunch of God damn nerds in here.
1:09:06
A good.
A good a good gateway game.
1:09:08
But see, I feel.
Like Kevin for North Africa is a notorious game, takes like 2000 hours.
1:09:14
Well, notoriously it was developed as like maybe almost a joke where the designers like, oh, I
didn't actually intend for anyone to play this.
1:09:20
And no one has.
But but I think that's my point.
1:09:24
I think like.
OK, but but it's at least, you know, it's it's in the conversation of like, hey, you know, maybe
1:09:30
maybe we don't want to just, you know, jet you rocket you all the way to the top of the absolute
best pinnacle of gaming.
1:09:38
Maybe save that so you can truly, you know, appreciate it.
Maybe try some of these other games.
1:09:45
Or try isolate the Spire and if you bounce off that try dysome answer like you know.
The dysome answer, but get rid of the dice.
1:09:52
Also, we don't like losing, we don't like the randomization and there's too many Dick jokes.
But with a few a few tweaks, perfect game.
1:10:01
So I'm trying to find a a negative review and steam so I could have a counterpoint and I've I've
just keep scrolling and I haven't found 1 yet.
1:10:10
Which is amazing that like I don't think.
Anyone has ever written a negative review for Slatus Power?
1:10:15
They may have given a thumbs down, but I don't know if they've actually written a review because
they know their opinions are wrong.
1:10:21
Well, I mean it.
It's so.
1:10:23
The most the the most damning one I can find is it's all right from someone who has 3000 hours on
record.
1:10:31
It's like you are, you're scrolling through this, the sleigh, the Spire, and I'm trying to vamp here
while I, you know, pause.
1:10:39
All right, here we go.
Hey check this out this Rouge like deck builder with a peeling art style that that should already
1:10:47
tell you what you're in for What?
OK, here.
1:10:50
Here we go.
Here's.
1:10:50
Roll the like deck builder with a with a.
Here's a thumb, say Rouge, by the way.
1:10:54
From Barnacle Collective As much fun as a slot machine.
Thumbs down 52 hours.
1:10:59
If I'm not mistaken last update for this game was in 2022.
As other people I comma what I experienced performance issues in the form of quote stutters.
1:11:10
No mention solution helped so no recommendation for me.
Thumbs down from Cali 8.6 hours.
1:11:18
I mean, to be fair, that is very frustrating.
I like how this podcast is now about Slate, Aspire and every podcast episode.
1:11:25
What?
Are you going to say now I, I mean, I, I, we joke about how we've mentioned in every single episode.
0:00
Oh, here's a here's a review we got here, one of about 610 out of 10 games I've never played in my
1:11:40
life.
Massively done.
1:11:42
I'm working with data from firelocks to cluster the winning decks into Presonus because I.
Like I sound like it's so much my.
1:11:50
My man's daydreaming about No, of course will, sorry.
Yeah, that was mine, yeah.
1:11:57
That's a good one.
That's a good, good review because I love thinking about it so much.
1:12:02
What?
What's good about this game?
1:12:04
It was basically my master's thesis that I mean like is what I mean.
Like in one of my classes like I just focused on taking the data from the spiral logs and doing the
1:12:11
clustering and it's like everybody best.
Thing.
1:12:14
Yep, Yep, Yep.
There we go.
1:12:16
Very excellent.
So anyway, yeah, well, dice, Dice romancer, what else we got?
1:12:26
I cleared out all my notes about all my my gripes here and so I think it's well covered from my
point of view the.
1:12:32
Entire thought process of this game has been derailed by the fact that I didn't play it right.
Well, I.
1:12:38
I've removed my score from our spreadsheet and just put it in a question mark.
I was perusing the the Chinese translated wiki for this game and I think if I'm understanding this
1:12:48
right I think I just uncovered another like eye popping mechanic that I never thought to try.
I think that I I might have to go and test this after we hit the stop recording button or if someone
1:13:00
wants to boot it up right now and try this.
I think you can open up the in game encyclopedia and re roll the numbers for all the enemies in
1:13:09
there.
I think if I'm reading this right where it says quote after unlocking the quote world dice thrower,
1:13:17
maybe that's a different a different item.
OK, you can modify the numbers in the battle encyclopedia in the encyclopedia during battle, but you
1:13:25
cannot modify the card illustrations.
Damn.
1:13:28
It is recommended that novices explore this aspect by themselves and sometimes you will feel
suddenly enlightened.
1:13:34
You need to enter the battle encyclopedia first and then click on the dice to use it.
So I like when they mean you can re roll any number you see on screen.
1:13:42
They they pretty much mean it.
Yeah, it's also how you change the dice.
1:13:46
The the mouse sensitivity is through a dice roll.
Includes the Yeah, you actually can't.
1:13:51
You can't exit the game until you rolled Nat one.
Wait, isn't there a number next to how many dice rolls you have?
1:13:59
Yeah.
So in theory, like if you could just.
1:14:01
Roll it infinite times, yeah.
No, it's not.
1:14:04
It's not well capped, no, because I think the three.
Charges.
1:14:07
Two charges.
So if you run in, if you roll in that one, then that that ends the sequence.
1:14:12
But yeah, in theory, like you can like one of the the gameplay loops is like using the activated
relic, one die to like burn down everyone, all the enemies, like HP bars and then use the card one
1:14:25
die to recharge the relic, which I thought was neat.
I thought also what was neat was like as you progress through the acts and like you upgrade your one
1:14:37
die from AD 4 to AD10D6D10D6 to AD 10, Yeah.
And then to like AD 20 for act three.
1:14:47
Like I thought it was very clever how that impacted my gameplay decision making of like, well now
like instead of rolling this like 1D4 to alter the enemy's damage, I'm not going to have them do 20
1:15:00
damage to me.
Although I definitely accidentally did that a couple times.
1:15:05
It felt like it.
It repositioned my thinking in a clever way of like OK the dice is bigger now so now I have to focus
1:15:11
on different things to re roll.
Yeah.
1:15:14
For sure for.
Sure.
1:15:15
Re rolling I think it's pretty interesting.
Stops being quite as good.
1:15:18
You can't reliably get them down to like three hit points.
Yeah, but I mean like your helpful is still like big enough that like you're re rolling it from like
1:15:27
80 down to 20.
So it's still useful even if you've landed that 20, but you know.
1:15:32
Here here's another fun little use of the dice in keeping and not upgrading my dice and keeping it
tiny.
1:15:39
I was I was doing a berserker run where I would use MY1 dice to re roll the amount of injury damage
I was taking.
1:15:46
So that was, so that was kind of fun.
I think it's, I think it's pretty a pretty nifty gimmick, that's for sure.
1:15:54
But not nifty enough for you to want to play, apparently so.
Well, I mean I got a good.
1:16:00
Six hours?
Well.
1:16:02
I think, I think, I think we got to just do the ratings now so I can go can leave the leave the pod
and go play it more and see what it's like and then I'll I'll give it the real rating next time.
1:16:15
Rock'n'roll.
Very good well, hey I'll actually I started this off the last couple times somebody else go let's
1:16:23
roll for it 1234 all right I got my metal D20 here I've rolled a. 20 Well get out your D20.
That's you.
1:16:30
Oh, OK, I see.
It's the roll.
1:16:32
The D. 20 We don't have AD four with the arms reach somewhere.
I mean, we can do.
1:16:36
Hold on Will, I'm going to roll for you.
Why?
1:16:39
Can't I just use?
I have excel open right here and I have it equals random between ready.
1:16:44
I just did Google 1D four and I got a three so.
Wait, 1D four?
1:16:48
Oh, I was going to roll D20.
I I I see well.
1:16:51
It's higher first or last?
I'm just going clockwise around the zoom screen here.
1:16:56
Yeah, what?
My my.
1:16:57
Scott, just roll a dice and tell us who plays.
OK, the Google Dice has said three, which clockwise is Colin.
1:17:04
OK, I give this game a question mark and or A1 I'm going to give it AD 12 I think.
So like I'm going to say it's wow, I rolled AD 12 and I got a 10, so it's 10 out of 10 game.
1:17:24
EBay.
That is a shit wave determining.
1:17:28
The actually a 10.
Out of 12 is an 8.333 repeating.
1:17:33
No, this could have been the 1st 11 out of 10 game.
That makes more sense if it got lucky.
1:17:39
No, I mean I I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I feel like I genuinely misunderstood a core
mechanic.
1:17:45
So my guess is that I'll like it more if I play it with the right mechanics, but it does annoy me
quite a bit that I didn't realize that.
1:17:54
Like, I don't mean I'm going to have to open it up and like poke around, but I don't know how long
it would take in for me to realize that.
1:18:04
And I probably would never have realized it because I would have stopped playing because I was like,
oh, this is just a weird, poorly balanced game where you need to get like some weird random luck to
1:18:13
get to draw the right cards to, to get through.
Like I I managed to get, I almost got through the first boss without using any of those dice rolls.
1:18:24
I was like man this feels like an OP build and I still was like I can't fucking get through this
boss so.
1:18:30
Yeah, the health roles are.
That really helps.
1:18:32
Yeah, I went through all of his health except for the last bar.
I got him down to two hit points and all of his health.
1:18:39
So yeah, I'm going to give it a question mark.
TBD.
1:18:44
I gave it a 5.7 when we started the episode.
I'm guessing it'll be slightly higher than that by the time we everything said and done.
1:18:52
Right on.
I'll go next year.
1:18:55
Just to reiterate quick disclaimer, I joined this podcast late and at the time of me joining we were
stack ranking them and so I had a weird review system, but then they changed it on me folks.
1:19:10
They totally switched it around and now we're we change.
It for you, Andrew Regular.
1:19:14
Out of 10 well, you know, And so my my ranks are my my numbers.
They don't matter.
1:19:19
They they matter even less than everyone else's rating numbers all right, so check it out this game.
I don't really I don't especially love deck builders, but once I finally got a that's why it
1:19:33
happened.
Well, just to spite you.
1:19:37
Well, counter spike, another game coming from purple robe games.
I am going to I'm going to upgrade this dice mechanic from the one dice mechanic from novelty to
1:19:50
innovative mechanic.
I think it adds quite a bit and there's a lot a lot of interesting usage that really kind of
1:19:59
exercises your brain in a fun and unique way that I've not seen in another game.
You combine that with the the quite striking.
1:20:11
And and enjoyable art style animations and of course, first person shooting effects.
And this is this is a game that I would definitely recommend to people.
1:20:24
Maybe maybe casual dice.
Pardon me card deck building gamers, but hey, you know we haven't talked about this whole time.
1:20:34
Is the dice rolling animations super important?
I really harped on this one during the Omega Bowl.
1:20:43
That slice and dice had physical physics objects rolling dice that actually looked halfway decent.
How does the D20 roll animation look in this game?
1:20:55
That's pretty good.
It's honestly probably better than D&D Beyond, which is like atrocious.
1:21:02
So and, and, and that is that a pretty good dice rolling effect is going to also speak to the score
that I'm giving it, which is it's my new number 25 scoring 5.71 points.
1:21:20
Who's next?
According to the dice roll, will is.
1:21:23
All right, well, these scores, obviously, they matter a lot.
So here's the correct value. 6.5.
1:21:31
It's a 6.5 game.
It's.
1:21:34
Yeah.
What is it that it's just.
1:21:35
It's not, it's not a great game.
I don't.
1:21:38
I do think they.
The dice is a gimmick.
1:21:40
The dice is a gimmick.
And that puts it in the company of Stack Land, Streets of Rogue Griff, Land Sales, Taj Mahal and
1:21:48
World of Horror.
So still, like if I'm, if I'm trapped on a desert island and I've got nothing to do, you know, tic
1:21:55
tac toe in the sand or this game, I'll probably play this game.
That's that's how I feel about it.
1:22:00
So bringing endorsement.
All right, I'll bring us home here.
1:22:04
Where did that Google Sheet tab go?
Did I some answer for me, I think 7 out of 10, I think I had this rated higher and then it kind of
1:22:14
tumbled down the rankings.
The more that I played it, It just kind of felt like there was a lot of cognitive load that I had to
1:22:20
do every time.
And at the end of a long day, you know, there's there's like there's times where unraveling that
1:22:26
puzzle will be super satisfying in other times where I think it's just like, you know, like the, the
art style can only really carry it for so long.
1:22:33
I think the, the art style for this game is great.
I think it adds a ton of charm to it.
1:22:42
And I think it's, it really adds to like the vibe coziness of like the the fairy tale nature that
you're in it and.
1:22:51
And their music's pretty good, too.
Yeah, I, I and I thought the music was, was pretty good, maybe could have stood to be a little
1:22:59
longer before looping, but I think it does does kind of also reinforce that, that whimsical notion
to it.
1:23:08
I, I, I liked the dice mechanic the more and more that I sort of play with it.
And I can definitely see how when you get a really solid broken build going, how it can just like
1:23:17
spiral out of control and get to that sort of monster train level of nonsense.
I just kind of wish it did it faster.
1:23:24
But yeah, I can totally see how this would be a fun a fun thing to explore.
If like, oh, you know, I've put it like a a bunch of time to say the Spire put a time bunch of time
1:23:34
to monster train.
This would be another good kind of thing.
1:23:36
I don't know if it has has the legs to last as long, but certainly interesting.
And yeah, definitely, definitely worth a look.
1:23:47
Yeah.
So I think similar games to this, we kind of talked a little bit about the the itch dot IO precursor
1:23:54
to Diceomancer called Dice is the way.
I also think if Diceomancer was listed in early access, maybe I'd give a little more leeway.
1:24:00
But anyway, other similar games, Estrella 6 sided oracles, I think does dice and drawing mechanics
maybe a little better with randomness mitigation.
1:24:11
There's a game called Rogue Lords that I think is interesting.
And maybe also I think that one from a an art style perspective, actually.
1:24:19
Why do I have this on here now that I'm looking at it?
Oh yeah, it has.
1:24:23
It has some more kind of like number mitigation on screen type stuff.
So kind of taking the same sort of mechanic.
1:24:31
Monster train we mentioned a whole bunch.
There's a game called Betrayal at Club Low which is a very short interesting game about like I think
1:24:40
there is an aspect of like manipulating people with dice in a way.
There's game meteor fall Krumitz tale that has a similar kind of whimsical aesthetic to it.
1:24:53
There's Rogue book, which is highly recommended from from people in the interwebs, Co designed by a
one Richard Garfield of Magic the Gathering fame as as Andrew mouths all sorts of interesting stuff.
0:00
And then there's a there's a game called Dyson fold that I think also kind of involves Dyson card
1:25:15
mechanics as well.
So give those a a check out at some point.
1:25:21
But yeah, that's gonna wind down.
We're rolling A1 on our energy levels here for the show.
1:25:26
As we wind down here send, you know, roll roll your dice for sending us emails to
grogpodzone@gmail.com.
1:25:34
Mastodon grog pod at game dev dot place.
And actually, while I have meant to do this last time and I biffed it yeah, like we we have another
1:25:44
listener request week coming up fairly soon after Andrew's pick.
So, you know, use that that that you're listening to this somewhere on web 3 point O right comment
1:25:55
below.
There's got to be some kind of comment box.
1:25:58
What game do you want us to see play?
We'll add to the list and you know, we'll give it its due diligence.
1:26:02
So grog pods on gmail.com.
Our Mastodon is grogpod, a game dev dot place, which I need to I need to post more of our like
1:26:10
meaning that we do in the discord to there.
I feel like we've been, we've been pretty on point with our images and meaning going on, but but to
1:26:18
give people a kind of.
Yeah, not to brag about our discord, but it's pretty good.
1:26:24
And by our Discord, you of course just mean the four of us in a, in a, Yeah, right, Like a change.
So yeah, it's not like there's a Discord where you're missing out on all of the the fun behind the
1:26:34
scenes features.
The the tank of listeners that that would be willing to sign up for Patreon.
1:26:42
Yeah, so Grogpod dot zone, all of the stuff all in one place as you, as you would expect, Colin,
your next pick what is what is AD 6 from this game have in common with the game that we're playing
1:26:56
next?
Oh it's cubes baby.
1:26:58
It's cube chaos.
I don't even really know what or how to describe this game seeing as I haven't played it yet and
1:27:06
just from looking at the steam I don't know what it is but I'm excited.
It says something about giant armies, factory self replicating murder crabs, RTS slash roguelike
1:27:20
slash.
Something I had with extremely low graphics.
1:27:24
It looks like some sort of RTS worms type game.
I'm not sure what it is.
1:27:30
Scott recommended it and I wholly endorsed it, so I'm.
Like what if what if Conway's Game of Life had Ms. Paint style graphics and just like extreme visual
1:27:43
overwhelmingness?
Or after 5 minutes, Yeah.
1:27:47
What if and we're going to find out next episode.
Yeah, yeah, we will find out.
1:27:52
But to play us out this time are some tunes to accompany Little Purple Riding Hoods crossbow
adventures through the forests.
1:29:05
Music.
