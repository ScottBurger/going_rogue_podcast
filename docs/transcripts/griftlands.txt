Hello again, and welcome to the Grog pod roguelike podcast, a podcast about roguelike games and everything associated with them.
I am your corrupt admiralty host, Scott burger and as always, I'm joined with my rogue's gallery of Cohoes.
0:40
This is Colin the Fishman and this is the coin flipping negotiating Rook.
And you know we'll that's my name's.
Ooh yes the one the nameless one.
I mean if you did change your name to a chess piece it wouldn't it wouldn't really shocked me that much, but I'm Brooke is not a bad name.
1:00
I am glad they won with that name.
Out of all the chess pieces names.
I think that's a little Bishop.
That's that's, that's a fighting game.
No, good this week.
We are talking Griff lands released, June 1st 2021 on Playstation Xbox, steam Nintendo switch.
1:18
You can kind of find it.
Basically everywhere, this is a, this is our second way entertainment game.
See previous episode, invisible ink, or for thoughts on that one.
And in case we hadn't mentioned it.
Last time, other games by Clay entertainment include Mark of the Ninja, which everyone needs to play.
1:38
Amazing stealth game if I'm probably mention that last time, but it Bears, repeating amazing.
Stealth game.
Hot lava.
I'm really looked into, but, you know, I'm glad that someone at least made A game where the floor is, lava at some point.
Oxygen, not included a oh, stay tuned.
1:57
They played that gate.
I hate it.
I really don't like it.
It's all coming together now.
I understand.
Okay, this is the maker of this.
Well, so, what the flip side of that rut coin here, is they also made Don't Starve Together, so there you go.
2:14
It balances out.
All right, yes.
I'm just regular Don't Starve but Well yeah, I mean, well, I think at this point, is it one game now?
I think ya know how it worked.
I think, from what I understand about, how the steam like product SKU system works, is if you take like an existing one and merge it with another, and it carries with it like all like the ratings and stuff.
2:40
So like if you, if you go in to see me to type in, Don't Starve like you physically.
Can't find that item to buy anymore, it is just don't starve together.
Now, Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I've only really played it as the multiplayer game.
Yeah, that's true.
Anyway, Griff lands, clocks in at our sixty fourth most popular roguelike in the genre with twelve thousand five hundred and seventy-three total reviews.
3:06
Colin your core argument this week is to gruff beguile and fast talk your way into a one-sentence description of what one does in this game of G of Griff lands.
You Are building a deck to actually technically you're building two decks, 12 fast-talk, negotiate and conman your way and just into and out of sticky situations and the other is a battle deck where you just beat them up instead. and you're in some sort of weird techno dystopia, but like, also kind of a wild west I just I thought you're wrong on this one.
3:47
I'm sorry, the actual description here is that it's an st, its latest fire, rip off where it focuses on the story and decides to make the game five times.
As long for no reason.
Other than to bore the player, I feel like those both can does can exist side by side.
I know yours.
What's in a name?
4:02
Like it may be a more positive light.
I'm just saying it.
Like it is.
This is I'm describing the physical actions that you do.
Yeah, it is today.
There's two Decks that are there are two decks that's true.
Yeah.
So it's interesting.
Yeah.
Is this a techno dystopia?
4:18
I thought this this, the setting for this game.
Well, I I just kind of assumed it was like some sort of either post-apocalyptic future and or alien planet, but maybe that's another, it can, it can be both sort of situation.
I guess I'm the same.
Yeah, I was exact, I was just about to say room world.
4:33
It's got that weird like Star Wars rimworld.
It's both high-tech.
And yet you're still like scrounging for parts in the junkyard.
Star Wars I think.
Yeah that's that's that's that's that's a little more true because we're more easily you know more sparse not as developed this is like there's actually colonies and we'll probably higher population and that kind of thing.
4:55
But yeah high and low tech for sure.
Does.
It does feel very Tatooine e.
Yeah.
I mean how does Artie.
It's got a lot of those.
It's got I don't never know what genre is but it's got the tropes of of a genre.
5:11
It's like oh there's the far away.
Empire or something that's like encroaching on our, on our Outlaw with the Shogun there, the Japanese sort of like yeah, the the shogun's and you have like the the cities and there's like that conflict between you know, who controls who manned and all that fun stuff, is that?
5:32
Yeah.
And it's like well that and like Fallout has kind of the same Vibe where it's like you know you're an action, a wild west kind of thing where the your Pretty rugged individualists and you're slowly being oppressed by the higher Tech Collective.
5:53
That's also somehow corrupt and whatnot.
It's a very there, a lot of tropes in that hmm, that this kind of sticks to.
Well, our Story begins here in Griffin lands by picking up in media res with our bounty hunter character soll ich Derek.
6:14
Big solid like Derek.
Yeah.
Better Call Saul you're going to have to negotiate and fire fight your way to collect the bounty on the the person who sold you into slavery, which I thought was fun.
But yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stuff to unpack here.
6:32
There's just there's a lot of systems there is map systems, there's deck building systems.
There's next dexa, building Things.
Yes.
Well I guess really in love system and like or I guess a what's that?
6:49
What's that alignments?
Or like?
It's not a line.
Action relationship kind of thing.
Yeah, but individuals canalization status.
Yeah.
I and you have money, you have meta upgrade points.
7:05
You have more than one meta currency.
Yeah you have day-night Cycles in this game.
There's there's a lot of stuff happening but I think this this game thrusts you right into the to the thick of action to set you to set your sights on basically saying hey this person over here, this alien.
7:27
Mutant person wronged you, your job is to go and seek revenge.
And that's the, the first of the three story characters, that, that we come come into contact with did.
Any did either of you crunch through the whole story of our first character here at all?
7:47
I I didn't I eventually got to a point where I'm like, I don't understand if this is a run based game or not, so I'm going to purposely die so I can have that experience before we do this podcast because I was like, I'm I'm pretty sure you're supposed to do multiple runs and you get unlocks and stuff like that.
8:09
So I want to see what that system is like. and also see if I can get to like, move on to the next character and see, like, I only did the first two, but I'm like, I need to at least have experienced a second character, but, no, I didn't get to the end of the First characters Arc, did you Well I mean I got unlocked all three characters and I played through them all to the point of death and like and I focused I think multiple runs on Rook because I liked that gameplay the motor the mechanics of the deck, the most.
8:45
But no, I think I got to like I got to like the end of day for which I think is the end will last the final day with Rook.
But I on the first character, I didn't like the first character.
I didn't.
I mean, not that like the characters like the actual Personality really mattered at all, to me, because I'm more of just like into the optimization of, and the beating of the game.
9:07
So the actual story didn't mean pretty much anything to me.
And so, yeah, I just went with the character that I thought had the most fun cars unique to him.
Yeah, for me I did the exact same thing Colin did and I was like okay I want to like understand have this game operates first.
9:26
And this game is is a roguelike deck builder in the sense that there's there is like Dex optimization your combat deck, in your negotiation deck and you're very in your standard deck builder T fashion going through and figuring out old.
9:46
Like what, what sort of things do I have to work around with this?
How can I tuned in optimize it, but I first played throat, just like ad card.
Add card, add card, add card in, in the best deck builder, strategy possible.
So shocker that.
Yeah, I wound up.
10:02
I knew that that first run that I was doing was doomed anyway so I'm like yep okay Colin strategy just going to like pick all the worst options just to die and see what happens.
And I was I was pleasantly surprised to see that the next run One was different than the first one at least, in terms of like options that you have.
10:22
And what my first assumption was like, oh, like this.
It's a very like narrative-driven, story-based, deck-building roguelike game.
Very different than the previous rope.
Like that Builder games that we've covered between stack lands.
Let's see, if I remember this without pulling up the side back lands we covered B and tight spaces.
10:44
We did.
Loop hero, another deck builder Manos, the hands of Fate, one and two, and between those like I guess maybe Loop hero was the one that had like the closest to like story-driven stuff to it that, right?
11:03
Yeah, but even that's more like a world story.
An Ambiance and you are, it's not run based.
So you're exploring the story through.
Hmm, through one single run, just grinding it over and over and over again.
11:22
Whereas in this case it's like it's each run, you're repeating the story, but like the individual elements that will happen in that story or different.
Yeah.
So like, a mass effect sort of thing where the overall story is already like set in stone, but you're kind of choosing points along the way.
11:39
You want to help this person.
Do you want to hurt this person?
Do you want to negotiate?
The want to fight?
It's kind of like that sort of who you want to work for or but It All Leads essentially to the same point through kind of like a very similar stories. yeah, I think it's so I'm going to, I think this is probably going to get a compared a lot to Hades because that's the only run based game that I think actually does.
12:07
The story aspect of it really well and that's because it fully incorporates the idea of the run into the story, like one of the problems I have with this is like, okay, you do some of the story and then you the next time you start just like, oh, you have a weird sense of deja, vu.
12:27
It's like, haha, tongue-in-cheek, you're doing it again.
Uh-huh.
But that's as much as like, the characters aren't aware of you doing runs.
And so, It makes, I don't know.
I felt like it made the dialogue and all of the the it's all flavor text in a lot of ways.
12:49
It kind of in a roundabout way kind of reminded me at FTL nose and a little bit of a sense because like every run of FTL, your goal is still the same.
Like, you got to go and like fight the mothership at the end of the game.
But like the this quote-unquote story beats an FTL that you do are are different, every time.
13:08
Time and don't don't reference previous runs or anything like that and like that.
It's not quite the same thing here, but I got maybe like a hint of the same cinnamon spice that they used in both of them a little bit where, you know, your goal as as solid as yeah to like go and kill your Bounty Hunter nemesis.
13:34
And the first run that I was going through, I'm like, okay, like I'll like align with this person and I'll do like, you know, this event that pops up in between your main mission story beats this time.
And then, like the second run that I did was totally different like, okay?
Like now I have a little pet alien dog with me.
13:52
Now, this is kind of cool.
I was happy to see that it was different.
And yeah, if it hadn't been different, I would have been pretty down on this game.
I think. but all I, you know, I say that but I don't know like It would have made it just a different game.
14:13
Probably a worse game in some ways.
It would meant that you It would mean that the meta currency meet should mean much less.
It means that you actually like trying to go through and beat each of these things and then be done with it.
Unlike something like Hades or so.
14:30
The Spire where you really are the expectation is that you can play through it while bunch of times many many times and you will not win a lot, most of the time until you're good at the game.
14:49
You can imagine 20% chance at maximum with Ironclad on ascension, 20, sure.
But like at a certain point like will you you can choose how often you would like to win based off of how high like if you played Ascension 0 on slay, the Spire you could win every single time.
15:06
Right?
Yeah.
So that's it, but that's not true.
When you start the game you get up to that level.
Griffin's feels like it's kind of an awkward.
As own where you are expected to runs with.
The ones are really long.
15:23
Slide, the Spire, you just like if you die, you die fast.
Hey well you mean like the there's an expected life span or like you know you can kind of like get into the Midway through the second actor like dying in.
The second act is kind of like kind of the probably the the median progress or the really the ax was like, how long do you think the average run of slaves?
15:46
Fire Hades is.
Place where I think it's like 30 minutes.
It feels right?
Yeah.
Between 30 minutes and an hour.
Yeah. 30 minutes to an hour for like the actual median run.
16:02
And then the average successful run is maybe an hour to an hour and a half.
Yeah, I'd say about an hour and 15 minutes is probably about right like Granted playing slower, but like these problems, I don't know how long.
16:18
Do you think the average run of Griff lenses?
It's it takes a lot longer.
If you read the fucking dialogue, which I know, please don't don't actually read the dialogue.
These like these screens where it's like, one character left, one on the right.
And they're like talking gibberish like this is kind of like the one of the things of the game is that they speak in their own language and they succeeded English.
16:37
Huh?
Speaks English simlish, whatever Ryan.
You know what I mean?
Like, Okay.
16:56
Fine and and you're going to make me read all this stuff but I don't I don't recommend that at all like these walls of text.
What was my point about this mr.
Time.
It's a huge waste of time.
Oh yeah.
I went through the first time and And I was actually like paying attention to this.
17:14
Am I reading everything?
And then I realized that, nope.
I'm just going to click as fast as I can through all this crap because ultimately, the decision is always the same.
Do negotiate with this person to you battle this person or do you want to work for this person.
Those are like an essentially, a three things and it's just like are they good?
17:30
Are they evil?
I don't care.
Just get me to something interesting and there's also doll this dialogue.
Other other Trope is is instead of doing negotiate or battle?
It's negotiate then battle.
It's like okay so you just have to do Fight twice.
Well yeah but if you negotiate first, you get a slight advantage in the battle and like that's kind of like the and you get an extra car, just slightly more rewards if you slow the game down even more.
17:51
Right?
What take?
I kind of like the dialogue in this game.
Well you are wrong.
I'm afraid.
I that's just because like so so playing on the steam deck like I think like this game doesn't really play Super Wellness team deck because it's like all the font is like incredibly tiny.
18:11
It plays better than you.
I think it would on the steamed egg but you know break out your cheater glasses for it.
If you're even remotely concerned I think like this looks and plays a lot better on a big full screen desktop but when I was first playing it on the steam deckhand Mike, is there something bugged?
18:29
Because like those little like goofy, alien-like dialogues between characters.
Something on the steamed act like flipped the switch for, there's an option in the menu settings, to auto store, like skip to the end.
All the dialogue.
So like, yeah, you get into a dialogue segment and then I'll just go like one person.
18:47
Just go boo.
Boo.
And then it'll have like, like the hundred line long like back and forth dialogue.
And I would, I would like on the steamed Echoes, like kind of frustrated with, like scrolling all the way back.
Be like, okay, wait a minute, what just happened.
Like, do I want to know?
They've optimized, but skipping through it.
19:04
They realized the most players don't care.
Well, I care because I want to make sure that That the admiralty gets what's coming to it and that, you know, that I'm freeing all of the all the people in the right places.
But oh no, I want to lick the boots.
19:22
There puts look so delicious.
So I tried to read as much of the dialogue and it's Not terrible, it's just not relevant.
19:39
That's the problem is like I can't it's not good enough for me to want to read it on its own and it's not relevant enough for me to convince myself to read it once.
I realized I could just right click and it would go to the bottom and then I could get on with playing the game.
19:56
Hmm.
And so I feel like they want so much for the dialogue and the story to be a part of the game.
But you don't have to engage with it at all in order to play the game.
Really, which if I can, if I can just like, throw this up, if it acted more like Mass Effect where randomly in watching this conversation in the Cinematic with real voice actors.
20:18
Like there's a little pause where you like you have to be paying attention because they ask you something.
There's a ticket.
There's a timer going down.
You have to like immediately respond with.
Like what do you want to do next?
And like that and it has to be relevant and like, would that have made a better day?
You think or like just have like actual Forks in the conversation instead of it being here's a giant wall of text and here's the same three decisions no matter what.
20:39
Yeah I guess that's probably if there were decisions during the conversation then it would be I mean cuz it's not, it's a conversation, not between you and another character, it's between your average.
20:56
You know, it's not between you the player and the character is between the played character and an NPC and you don't have any effect on the outcome.
Like the the person you're playing as is their own fully formed being and you have no effect on their personality, really?
21:16
How shocked would either?
View.
Be if you found out that this was originally started development as like a deck building based RPG.
That sounds exotic all shocked.
Honestly that.
21:32
So I I have not played the Gloom Haven RPG get I kind of want to because I'm very intentionally also a stay tuned.
If depending on how tortured have a definition of rogue like we really want to get with this program but I don't know if we could justify that because it's like a true, a true tabletop RPG but with cards like I don't know man, that's just D&D with cards but like I'm interested in it because I like the idea of cards as the randomization element in a TT.
22:02
R VG.
This Doing the dialogue stuff.
Has almost convinced me that it's a bad idea from something like this because I don't I don't know if it worked.
I don't, I did not like the dialogue deck, the shaitan one, the nagar.
22:19
Yeah, the negotiation deck.
What happens when you lose with that?
By the way, I never actually lost with the negotiations and I never had lost we get.
So yeah, like when you when you lose so there's there's standard combat.
If you played any of the Deck Builder games, that we've talked about so far or slay, the Spire, the only roguelike deck battle Builder.
22:38
That matters.
Your combat phase is just like very, very kind of Nerd.
You play a card and you attack your opponent's, Health down to zero, kind of, I guess.
Maybe we'll come back, this act, the diplomacy, or the negotiation quote-unquote encounter or combat phase, whatever different in many senses where you have your core argument, which has like some passive things that that do stuff like, oh, like our first character saw her main main Thing is that she gets like plus one effectively armor every turn and you can deploy cards that that do like passive effects.
23:22
Like, oh, this card here, will randomly attack one of your opponent's arguments like every turn, whatever I thought.
I actually thought like this diplomacy thing was pretty pretty fresh take on the system where I was, I was glad the like ogee combat style system was there.
23:42
I'm happy.
That this system is here and I'm kind of glad that.
That it isn't just the diplomacy deck also.
But so anyway, like should you lose a diplomacy interaction?
That whittles your god, what is it called?
24:01
Resolved, not your health but your other health quoting, your secondary health pool result.
Yeah.
That was that whittles down to zero and you basically lose the negotiation and all of a sudden like oh like that ammo cache thing that I was going to try to rescue for my for my buddy's.
24:17
Like oops I failed.
You know I roll A crit, not one on that negotiation and bungled it badly.
So now, the person, you know, laughs at you, they don't like you and you've kind of like, failed that that question has be.
And it, it doesn't like the like, the consequence of that is that it locks you out of negotiations in the future until you build that M back up, either, by winning combat or by going back, to your home base, and like, doing well doing Yeah, like doing stuff to like rebuild that meter or something.
24:52
Yeah, sleeping at a night.
Like there's like three opportunities to sleep.
But okay, admit that that makes sense because I was but that means that the only way to die then is to losing battle.
And so I should have like a theory then you want to lean more on the negotiation deck as like a.
Yeah, it doesn't really matter as much if I use.
25:07
And so I didn't know she Asian the negotiation pool resolve is kind of like Shields.
Almost, you should probably be negotiating first always.
If you And because there's especially as you get the towards the end of the day, / act, whatever.
25:24
Like when you're fighting the last boss thing of each day, you should absolutely always negotiate first because it's there's no, there's not a huge downside to losing that not in the same way.
If it's not, it doesn't end your run.
But this is so I have a question specifically for the first character because I think the second character is a little has a little bit more.
25:49
More Unique Mechanics, but for the first character, if you blanked out all of the flavor text and all the names of the cards and only had their mechanical effects, would you be able to tell if you were in a negotiation or a battle?
26:08
I don't think you could not really.
If you gave it to someone who didn't who hadn't played the game before, he said, one of these is a negotiation and one of them is a battle which ones, which I don't think that there is enough of a difference between like they don't feel different once just a battle where you use words in quotes and the other one is like, what's the difference between a like all you you you you hit their ego versus you hit them with like a kick in the back of the head.
26:35
It didn't feel any different was just like, Number of damage to a point pool.
I think, like part part of the problem is that, I don't know that I've seen a kind of like, negotiation system like this before.
26:55
Like, I'm trying to think like other games, that that I've played that do like you work on your speach craft in Skyrim or something to try to convince people, you're, you know, Trying to lay Morrowind with especially if I remember, like, back in the day, like the event.
27:13
They're the very special like system of like, convincing people.
But and that very much felt like a negotiation, right?
And I'm spacing out another another or like ones in God.
What is it?
Like Star Wars the Old Republic the like those kind of RPGs where you're like you're navigating like Like dialogue trees to like, determine like, oh, I want to go down this path versus this path.
27:42
And this path makes me more evil or more good.
And it's like this is like such a different spin on it that I don't know.
Like Colin, I think you're right in that.
Yeah, it's just like, it's like a different take on combat, quote, unquote.
But like, unless they were the the two Side by, you know, your character in the left, you're the enemy.
28:05
On the right during this negotiation phase unless they were like behind like lawyer stands like you know, in order to really convey like, oh this is, this isn't an argument and you are trying to win this argument, it would be, yeah, just another flavor of combat, but I'm glad that this game is at least attempting to do something different in that space.
28:27
Why are you glad about that like, are you glad because it opens up the opportunity, like the it gives Vision to other people or you like, what's the, what's to be glad about here, ya like Like being able to to have that kind of like not like like it feels, it feels like a new approach to it.
28:49
We're like, yeah.
You have like, like, slay, the spire and then you have like, 150 slave Aspire clones that are just, like, use use card on man and attack them.
And then, they are dead.
Her, a like adding in an aspect of, oh, well.
29:05
Maybe if I could convince this enemy too, Work with me for my go end goal.
That seems that seems like different enough to be interesting.
And even if all the systems here, don't like fully come together.
Yeah.
Like maybe it sets the stage for like someone to do.
29:22
It better down the road.
I mean, I think that I mean that's certainly a one way of looking at it, the wrong way, of course, but like the, this is 0.
So this is what happens in terms of the game development and this is why we had this system, which I think is a very bad system is It someone's like hey Slater Spire that's that's a good game, Let's copy that first.
29:43
We're gonna start with, let's copy that and then like okay what we can't have, it would be exactly the same.
So we're going to do is let's take something that this game is lacking.
Kind of like looking at that.
I think I mentioned the past like the ERC Griffey.
Got eliminate raised, what is it?
Something create and reduce.
29:59
And so what they decided to raise in this case to make something that's unique is the story and they said okay well we're going to just raise the story.
And so just on the basis of that one decision is just Everything's going to be based on the story.
Well, oh suddenly like as you if you've built up this whole story and you have encounters, you can't just always go right to fighting.
30:17
If your only option when you encounter someone is to fight or not fight and it's super boring, so like, okay, well, oh man, what do we do?
Oh, I know people.
They negotiate.
Yeah, let's add that in there and that'll make you unique.
And so, they just basically started with this bad premise, which is that adding more story makes it the game better, which is a very bad premise for like, roguelike deck, builders my opinion.
30:39
And then they added this negotiation because they were, are they were trapped by this idea that they needed to have the story and they had to have more variation.
What happens?
And then because of the, they had this, this, this, this ugly looking negotiation and that they had to have all this dialogue in there.
They had to add all these other bad elements.
30:56
And so, basically, in my view they just made the worst version of slay, this fire.
And that's, and that's really what happened here.
Is that like Yep.
They have a lot of good actually.
Okay, I'm gonna hold that.
31:12
Thought that's all true.
Everything I just said is true, but I will give it a one small.
They had an innovation.
They did have one Innovation when you play a card enough times it upgrades.
Hmm.
Oh yeah.
That's very good.
That was I think the one thing out of this entire game that I'm like, okay that's yeah.
31:32
Now they're suddenly an element of like, oh, if you have two of the same card in your hand and one has like Almost an upgrade.
Now, you have an incentive to play that.
It feels good when you get that upgrade and it feels good to be off with make a decision on the basis that.
So, that's the going thing.
I'm going to add on one good and one bad.
31:49
The good thing of, I also what I really liked how they had you'd like, play the powers or whatever you want to call them and they'd like, circle around behind your character, and it would be something that you could attack.
32:07
I thought that was a very engine Association face.
Yeah.
I really like that, as like, it's not just you.
You could try and defend yourself, or you could try to defend your powers.
It was like a little bit more of a nuanced way of dealing, with the, the whatever powers are, are insulators better.
32:30
Yeah, I mean, so, you just a form of minions though, right?
And latest fire, yo, you really only have your own character unless you're playing Defect with the orbs which are kind of like Min you have playing downfall.
We were playing as the the slime with actual minions.
32:45
Like yeah, I guess they're just minions but like the way that they're presented and the way that they act, I thought was really well done.
I like that a lot.
I think that's true.
That's because really and honestly I think that Zip both of the combat systems are by themselves.
33:07
Moderately good, fairly good.
I don't maybe I don't play the game enough to like, I didn't play the game.
As much as I played Slater Spire enough to live a really get a huge phone on, like, how good is this game?
Technically, but it's not bad.
33:23
I know that for sure like the combat systems are like They've got some new trees that work out well.
I'm gonna Circle back to the upgrade though.
The upgrades were super boring.
They're just like add a name in front of the card.
33:40
I don't know.
I just thought they were boring but I think like agreed boring in the sense of like it doesn't it doesn't transform the card in like a in like a humongous way that I feel like I might be, I might be eating my words here a little bit.
33:58
But like from what?
Like I'm almost on the flip side from what little I played of slate of spire and upgrade of like plus 12.
Something for some cards is like, basically meaningless versus others as like crazy powerful and I think in in Griff lands, when you use a card enough times, a little blue meter fills up and at the end of either combat or negotiation, you have the option to upgrade it.
34:24
What I like about that is it gives you the Option to upgrade in One Direction or another Direction.
So like do you want to go?
Like for example, there's some negotiation cards that you can or I think there's also combat cards were like you can draw like either draw five or like draw one extra one and they're all upgraded or something and like hmm.
34:50
Which one of those do I want like do I want like a really wide build or very tall built like I thought like the decision making there?
Was good.
But like, yeah, wasn't sexy.
Enough of like, oh my God, this is good.
Like I want to sorry, I'm sorry.
I realize as you're talking, I want to narrow in my criticism.
35:07
The mechanical upgrades to the cards were fine.
They are just a norm upgrade, but in such a narratively driven game for you, just so you have like the card fast talker, and it's just like, oh, we're just going to add a word in front of it.
Your Visionary fast talker, you're an endearing fast talker or whatever.
35:25
It's the same part is the same.
A blurb text.
Like just make it a differently named card.
It just felt like Lazy.
It's just like, I don't know, just throw a thing on front.
It's fine.
It makes the card.
It makes the card more cluttered.
35:41
It just, I don't know, you could just have them upgrades different cards.
Yeah, yeah, Charmander Charmeleon Charizard, you have a problem with that.
It has charted on it.
So it was it was like instead of Vaporeon or Espeon or Umbreon or VAP or down or whatever.
36:02
You know, all the vision Ambience, you're just like its water spr with water.
EV think that's a bad name for a Pokémon.
Well, Woody be as special, if chart, if like Charmander upgraded into has absorbed, who was like a totally different creature and like, so, I like, I get what you're saying, like, I ever really angry for gonna stay in that Pokémon realm.
36:28
There are like genuine Pokemon.
Only Hitman On yeah, mon Cher and involves our.
What's the one that evolves into two different separate directions?
Be like Hitmonchan or Hitmonlee, those do on those, don't evolve at all.
You a do.
36:43
And then you know like another fossil or like they do in the mausoleums and then like the third generation, there's a one that evolves into water.
The other based off its attack or defense is stronger.
Anyway, like You be like even if it was just like you go from Fast talker to smooth talker.
37:06
Mike.
Hmm I don't like some cool sunglasses on it and the art changes so it's like very similar but he has a sunglasses on instead.
Yeah, like it's just that it was just a word stopped in front and the same art.
Like if you're going to lean into the Aesthetics, which this game did feel like it very much did.
37:29
I felt like it was a Miss on that front.
Yeah I will yeah I think like to some degree yeah there's an element to be said of like oh I can I can recognize like this cards art and understand what it does just by looking at like the little picture of it.
37:50
Does this?
But like, slit does sleep Aspire doesn't do that though.
Like if you upgrade a carded, like the art doesn't change, does it know?
But slightest buyer doesn't give a shit about that kind of stuff.
Like I play slay, the Spire if it just had like the word of the card written a larger in the middle of it, it's like it's about make number of good, it hasn't very.
38:12
It gives a little plus next to the name and it's in and it changes the color.
Yeah.
Believe it changes the color to a green color.
So It makes it very prominent but it doesn't like, it doesn't?
It just says, plus it's the better one.
Yeah.
And I'll just say, like just while we're talking about the best game of all time, one of the best games of all time.
38:31
Welcome to the spidering during Griff lands.
I gotta say their points at which multiple times in these past two weeks that I've been like I fucking don't care at all about this alt f4 and then I immediately clicks latest buyer.
And I'm just like, okay, Greg gotta cleanse my palate here.
38:47
Gotta get.
That is way better.
Holy gotta get that second thousand hours in.
Well, they're like, actually I think I'm only at 800 I think logged on this machine.
So I'm not sure what it is overall, but like, It's definitely it's over 1,000 but well it's on the roguelike deck builder.
Spectrum, slay, the Spire is a very well, a was like one of the first deck builder Rogue legs only, I think like only a hand of Fate One and got I'm spacing on the other one but it was a board game.
39:17
It was a it was a, was it called the see?
Maybe think it's like coin Crypt or something.
It's like something you wouldn't.
You would not expect to be Like the first roguelike Dominion.
Was that Dominion?
No, no.
I'm like, I'm not talking about, like board games.
I'm talking about that's that's making the, the e-version of that was like, I think the first that's what that's what the craters slay.
39:38
His buyer said the game was based on or like yeah I mean dominions of pretty different game but I can see where it like it is a absolutely a deck building game.
And I could see hey I want to make this a new video game.
39:56
As a like I didn't get it wrong.
Yeah I mean like on that Continuum right.
Slay the spider.
Very Spartan like borderline arkady to some degree like you're like I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I've come from.
40:11
All I know is that I must kill scenarios, right?
Right.
There's very there is not a story, right?
Ambiance.
Like you said.
I like that.
That was a good term.
Yeah.
Say it's not a story.
It's official, I'll be honest, there's a Vibe, there's not a story.
There's totally an Ambiance, and of like, Slate Aspire.
It does what it says on the tin you go in and you slay that damn spider.
40:29
All right yeah grif lands is like the totally other end of the spectrum of like like one of the first things that really bug me about slay.
The spider Mike will really loves this game, will give it a shot like what what am I supposed to do?
Like, what's my what what's my character's motivation?
40:45
I need to get into the mind of the Ironclad and really understand why he's so enraged all the time.
So like green plants, totally other end of the spectrum, right?
Very narrative.
Story-driven.
I can I can understand that.
Like yeah.
The started off as like an RPG and then they pay but it into a deck builder, roguelike.
41:04
I wonder if like it would have been a better RPG if they just lean more heavily into that or if it would have been a better Rogue.
Like if they just like cut out some of the story stuff and like, more focus more on that, I feel like my straddling the to it, kind of does both a disturbance a little bit, but I think I still like the end product a lot because, like, I was playing through the First characters campaign, I'm like, I was getting, like, pretty invested in it.
41:31
Like, okay, like Like rallying, like these troops to go and like, take down this bounty hunter.
I had like a reason like I focus like really well on my negotiation deck.
I'm like okay I've got like this really good Synergy.
I really like screwed up my combat deck really bad by just overdrafting it a ton and like I got to the final boss fight and I'm like well it's combat.
41:57
I did not really hone my combat deck very well I'm just going to get bean really bad but you know what?
I'm I'm interested in trying this again with a more balanced approach.
Like, there's that for me, there's that hook that like okay, even though I've seen like the story beats to come, I think they're different each.
42:16
Time that you play in such a way that like yeah, I know my end goal is to go and like kill this, you know, Bounty Hunter lady at the end of the end of the story but I want to see what other stuff is different along the way and tried to like, you know, focus on that balance between the two decks to get there.
42:33
But okay, so let me let me just it's not that different.
Like that's the thing is like Soso a game like Mass Effect which I think does this mechanic right?
There is a many branches like you can make decisions at any point about do I say this person or kill us personally and like those are all very important positions to have.
42:50
But by the end of the game, I mean, most players just play it one time and like, that's it.
Do you like okay?
Oh, I didn't do this thing.
Let me watch the video, like, me to go on YouTube and watch the, like, with the cement cinematic for what would happen.
If I would have, chosen the in this game is like, oh, you died now, go back and make that exact Same decision or don't, but like you're going to take the opposite position then like oh you're going to either be the boot licker or you going to be a part of the rebellion and it's just like, okay.
43:15
And then once you play the game for the third time and she's like, oh great, I have to make this exact choose exactly one of those issues I had maybe four and chances are as far as I can tell.
I didn't actually beat the game and the many times I played and I could consider myself pretty good at this type of game, though.
43:32
I mean, like, I think I just want a nice.
I can see very much the Reason.
Like I mean you draw five cards, you have 3, AP, you like and I know what cards are good in general.
Based on my understanding these games and I didn't beat the game in like the probably eight times I play it.
It's right.
43:47
Which means that you need to play it many more times to write exactly.
Medic currencies to you can like start with more Health, right?
Do they want you to play one storyline over more than three times?
And is my is my estimation, they want you to probably play it like five, six, seven times before you actually beat one of the characters.
44:06
And I have a big problem with that.
I got a big problem with that because that gets old real fast and then you're sitting there just like I am on the first down.
Run, clicking as fast as you can, throw all the dialogue because it's just boring.
It's just so just right click and it goes automatically.
Yeah well I wish I would have known that.
Thank you calling.
44:21
How did you not accidentally drank like II your fingers like this sweater is a left, click only game.
They remember when clicker, you don't have to get your finger doesn't accidentally click the right outside but I'm sorry, one time they should have been Oil on how to right-click because I would have definitely.
44:39
I mean I happened after it like the third time it happened.
I was like, oh cool.
Maybe my hands are just twitch easier than yours sidebar.
Over my mouse is related to tutorial stuff like the first, I don't know.
Maybe like the first hour or so.
44:55
I was like continuously.
Forgetting like how everything in this game worried but I think like I was glad that you just hit the start button, tutorial, bam right there.
In case you like, have the attention span of a fly like me.
And you're just like, wait a minute, how like, is, what am I supposed to do during negotiation again, boom.
45:13
Right there.
This is how all this stuff worked, very clear.
I thought that was great.
I think like, even, even now a lot of times when I'm playing sleigh, the Spire.
I'm just like, what happens if I do this like, oh my god, I'm an idiot.
45:29
Why would I do that?
Where's my undo button, undo button?
I don't think in the in Griff lands, I needed to to hit an undo button.
Even that very good tool tips.
Yes, they're too embarrassed on their cars is very good.
Well, tell me what you thought about the music and other irrelevant things.
So the actual game, I mean really the way.
45:45
So the music I thought I was a serious question because I don't remember if there was music or not.
The music I think was was okay to start.
I think, like, as I was digging through the music to put to anchor for the, for the end of the podcast, like, I was kind of bummed that like all the good music is for later characters and that's not to say that like you're beginner characters, musically, her bad, her music is bad or anything but like I think that like the music for like daytime and nighttime combat and negotiation is Like just slightly like better in a hard to describe way for The Rook character and the Smith character, just a little bit.
46:34
Like and I think that like also maybe a little too repetitive if there was like one or two more tracks in there or if it went slightly longer than like yeah, like I generally like the music in this game but if there was just like a little more or a little more variety to it because like at some point you know, It's like the same thing playing in the background over and over again, I'm like okay yeah I get it and you know, while playing this on the bus on the steam deck like I was mostly not playing with headphones, just kind of muted the whole time but when I was playing at home in the dust I'm like yeah, okay.
47:09
Like the music is good here sound effects, nice and crunchy.
Overall, like the art aesthetic, I think is great.
The music aesthetic, I think works really well with it.
I think that stuff works really well.
I don't like, I don't like clay visuals.
47:28
Like, klei entertainment.
I don't like the way that their games, look the very edgy Venture Brothers.
Almost kind of cartoon look to them.
It's not that edges.
It's the way that the like their bodies are proportioned or something.
I don't know.
47:44
That's, yeah, that's right.
I don't know.
Did you like the Don't Starve aesthetic?
I don't like Don't Starve.
I don't like, I mean, ghosts are fine.
And I just it doesn't bring anything of value to me, it gets the point where I just I just tune it out.
48:01
Like generally for me you there is no - for visuals.
There's just not having the positive.
So it just got a zero instead of a - but Like, Oxygen not considered did not actually that one is, one of the few games where I thought that the visuals somehow did drag it into a negative.
48:25
And this one just like, yeah, I don't know something about it.
The stylization just doesn't do it for me, but if you valued listener like that style, it is the best example of their style.
I think it's it's the best of the the clay entertainment games that I've played in terms of like it style is very good for what it is.
48:46
I just don't like it.
I mean, I mean, I agree.
I don't, I don't like it, right?
This is just like, I think I feel that way about many of the very cartoony, sort of games in general, but like with Don't Starve.
Like, at the time it felt like the, the 2D animation and a 3D like like, like sort of like herb.
49:07
Kind of a isometric game.
I realize that was somewhat novel.
I don't think I've ever that's fine and I thought that I thought it was really fun in that way and I thought I really added to the game.
The are in that game.
In fact I would say is like one of its really, it's great qualities and I think I gave that game like I don't know like it wouldn't hate or an 8.5.
49:26
I thought it's really pretty good game but this one.
No, I didn't actually help it and I, yeah, I did.
All the characters are disproportionate and I just think they're cartoony.
I don't like very exacting.
It's an exaggerated cartoon, right?
Looking at just like, pictures of Don't Starve.
49:41
And it's like the houses, like, shut up and out, and sideways and their planks are all at odd angles and everything looks like it's exaggerated more than I more than like gritty stylization or something.
49:58
I don't know.
I think my hot take here just to make will even more mad.
I think I like the art style here, a lot better than slate this buyer.
You are.
Oh my God, I can't even process that what I have no problem with you having that opinion slay, the spider is like a neutral.
50:18
On its like its aesthetic is fine, but it's not the goal of it.
And I think that this game does a good job of doing what it wants and it's it's it is the same as your love for the narrative.
50:34
Like yeah.
If you like the narrative, then it's good for you.
If you like this aesthetic style, then it's it does a good job at that.
So this fire is just me.
Hmm.
There is literally literally for a long.
Time to head.
Like the beta art was just like, I don't know.
50:50
I hand drew some shit like the art does not matter.
This game is not about the art, right?
This it makes it very clear.
What's important place prior game?
Not about our this game is about the are fun things about what a good job of coherently making that art throughout the game.
51:09
But yeah this is an unrelated question and I barely even remember what I was going to, but what made me think of it.
But Scott, have you play Disco Elysium No but like it's one of those games that like is an absolute Scott trap for me.
51:26
Yeah.
You should able far away from it because I'm definitely you will sink 40 to 80 hours into it.
I know just like it a lot.
It's got really.
That's the aesthetic that I like and it's got the thing where, oh, I remember was is the choices, you know, like speech versus whatever choices that one is like you get to make really.
51:48
Lee really interesting choices.
Yeah.
Like completely maybe we'll you'd like it too.
I don't know, but I know Scott would love it.
But you like the dialogue changes dramatically based off of what you can do, like the one where you just like can talk to objects and they just like whisper sweet nothings in your ears.
52:06
You like, talk to the like that it's unclear.
If you're actually just hearing voices, or if they're actually telling you things and the Arts, great and putting points into things.
Genuinely has a difference in the outcome of the game because it's a more like traditional RPG.
52:27
Right.
We're not like traditional RPG but like you have that kind of like point assignment system of like yes when you come to this to do that it's got a point.
It's got the RPG style stats, just the stats that the point that you're putting into our like weird, like one of them just like how much do you like drugs?
52:46
But that's like a point system of just like how into drugs are you and how how like how many drugs can you take and still have like a good time?
Yeah, I feel and like you can there's like a thing in that game where you like if you don't have enough Constitution you like sit down on a chair and it's a really hard chair and it's like really and it lowers their constitution and I died from sitting in the chair and it has specific dialogue for that was like you sit in the chair and it was like described viscerally.
53:17
Like how uncomfortable the chair was and how that was like the straw that broke you and drove you mad.
Nice.
It was delightful.
I mean, This makes me almost one.
I mean, if it wasn't so story-driven, it does look like a very well.
I think you might.
You might like it.
He's got very positive reviews and I like the sound of the xenyx of it.
53:35
It's nice.
And it looks like Fallout 1 or 2 or yeah, one of those early Fallout games with just another game that's the kind of game will that you like sit down you block off like an a-hole rainy afternoon, you have like a like a fifth-degree.
You have like a thumb or two Scotch I think.
53:52
Okay.
And you're just kind of like very like My assumption, of course, like, if I touch this game, I'm not gonna like sleep for two weeks, you know, and you, you very casually, navigate around the landscape, clicking on things, and getting like, deeper and deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, until you blink in this morning.
54:12
Yeah.
All right, yeah.
All right.
Now, please leave derailed this podcast, but I did want to, well, make sure that I gave that extra plug because that's a game that makes meaningful choices.
And I took it very Circle back to Circle back some to grow.
If lands would Griffin's in, your guy's opinion, be better if it was more in that RPG direction or better.
54:34
If like all the stories stuff was just totally stripped out and it was just the the combat and negotiation stuff.
I want the combat in the negotiation cards to somehow work together.
I want them to either be like both of there's there's a single deck and you either are playing the top half of the bottom half style thing like Gloom Haven.
54:56
We like, oh, you're getting a or, you know, you're getting new cards and you have to choose between one that has like a really good battle affecting ones that got a good like negotiation affect another half bad.
I don't know if that would be a good game.
55:11
I haven't really thought through it.
Be it would be a different game but I didn't like that.
They didn't That the two halves had nothing to do with each other.
There was really no Synergy.
There were no cars that you could play for one or the other.
55:27
There was a Synergy in a sense that like if you did all negotiation like at the end of negotiation, it gives you the opportunity to earn health and so the game was very much encouraging you to alternate between the two and so in that sense isn't a Synergy but I agree overall that that's the Decks that themselves like the game had Synergy but the decks themselves did not There are there was no overlap between them if I could you get a card that like is like if you have a gun and it's like the gun is like the overcharged or like the, you know, the flourish shoot, then your negotiation side should be like, instead of shooting the gun.
56:00
It should be like due to flourish and pointing at them to intimidate them like is that is right?
Yeah like I want I wanted the the cards to be Blended together and then also like the negotiations to be Blended together like threat of force as a negotiation texting, you Where it's like, okay you can still use all your negotiation cards but you still get the same like - modifier because you started pulling the gun instead and like you get the same bad malice effect from from fighting them or when you're I don't know like that this is started.
56:35
It turns it into a different game.
Yeah but like I wanted there to be some Linking of the two decks because otherwise it's just like, oh, I'm just I just playing to deck builders at the same time.
Yeah.
And it's diluting both of them.
Yeah.
What has to be super long so that you can upgrade both of them that you like you have Synergy like that was the whole purpose of like making the game too long and so that you can upgrade both.
56:57
That's basically slices long because you have to meet three times with a dialogue and cleanly and lets you right-click of course.
Yeah, no one cares as long because there's twice as many decks call.
You know what game is way too long, but does the the The simultaneous or the the single Deck with simultaneous actions, really?
57:14
Well then the other well remember like a million years ago we played War of the Ring.
Yes.
Those cards have like that.
Like you just click on that because I've never paid in Haven before but War of the Ring, like each of those cards has like, you know, a there like it's a single deck but it like yeah it's like it's two separate things going on simultaneously and yeah like well it's 100% right?
57:40
Like if you in the negotiation phase like gonna bring out the gun, all right?
Yeah.
Like the gun is part of negotiation amazing.
Like great idea and instead Of like the two decks being an either or situation, it becomes the single deck where the cards are either or and that I think is super interesting.
57:59
So like if nothing else you know the all-time you know a I'm sure all of the clay entertainment staff are big fans of the podcast.
So after we've been dunking on their game for for a solid hour, I'm sure they're going to write down all these notes but I guess of course they've cracked the code for Griffin's to but that would be something that the yeah, well.
58:20
Would be super great to see in either Griffin's to or some, someone ran with that idea for their own Indie spin-off game.
I think that, I think it would be much much harder to make.
That is a really hard problem, but yeah, there's a higher chance, there will be a bad game, but if you really wanted to have that dual aspect of it, that's what I think I would need in order to like feel like it totally engaged me.
58:48
And I'll just throw this out there, you know, because I'm just such a genius.
But yeah, this very mechanic of having your equipment affect the cars, you have.
This is what's going in through the game that I'm building, which is this latest fire.
Knock off.
So, that is a, I think a very great, I better be good.
Then it better have the game is building forts.
59:04
Well, I mean, mostly building, it's all I don't coming together.
Jerry Wars, you know, I saw, I have 40 hours left of that and will be so well on its way.
But okay, I do have to give my, how do you fix this game?
Sort of a Quick synopsis here because I think we've touched on it, but just to make it very clear like Mass Effect, just blend it with massive act.
59:24
If you're gonna, I get it, you're leaning into RPGs.
You want a story?
Okay, make those decisions important and make it so that you have to pay attention along the way because tell you what, you just right-click and through the dialogue and it makes absolutely no difference about like the direction the game go.
So make that important and also and that's my first piece of advice, second piece of advice.
59:43
Add x-rated conterra.
Okay.
Add Add in like, okay, so what made Mass Effect, special, and some sense.
Why did you care?
Why did you care as a player whether or not you're, oh, cuz you get to date some people, you get a form relationship.
Like, I already have liking and disliking make it so that you can form a romantic relationship with some 80's has that.
1:00:03
I know.
And this is just such an obvious thing for mind of like, what sells sex sells?
I mean, come on, this is classic marketing, come on.
And so the cells will love and that's how you make STS better, slay, the Spire you.
Did you need the Ironclad to find?
1:00:20
Love on the way through the tower?
And then to give up on defeating the heart and settle down and raise some little iron children whose Altair?
Oh no.
They that came before the shooting.
It doesn't kill the heart.
1:00:36
You're actually stitching two pieces together.
Oh yeah, that's beautiful.
No, I hate it.
Um, but like that.
No.
But you're right though that you need meaningful choices.
That's right.
That's that's what The if you want to have a narrative you need to have choices that matter to the narrative.
1:00:53
Yep.
As is just them talking at you.
That's that's my big, my that I mean I'm always here with telling people how to make better games is how you do it.
This one could have been a an 8.5.
I think they could have gotten up to an eight point five.
If these were meaningful choices and relationships were more important.
1:01:09
I think that these could have been a much better game because it had the solid basis as soon as you ground yourself and slay the Spire, it's hard to do less than a 6 out of 10.
Unfortunately, well I'll wait.
Do we want to get into the the rankings here?
Yeah, let's hit the hit that transition Lieber.
1:01:25
Okay.
Transition hit because I mean like okay base level if your ass latest by or knock off, you can't not going to do worse than six which is my minimum for recommendation.
But that's only this game gets up to a six point five which is like sad because it's got a lot of really like interesting components is got some interesting characters raises like, this whole world is design.
1:01:46
It's very novel.
Is got all these Is going into it, but it didn't get more than point zero point five out of that.
Because it's just so, it's just so annoying to go through all the dialogue and did not really feel like it's meaningful and to have two decks and to have the game last three to four times as long in a run and a game that you want me to play many times through and make the same decisions.
1:02:08
Know this is a very bad game design.
I mean, clearly, like, who's thinking about this?
This is a terrible.
So, so the six point five out of ten, I think that puts it at eight.
Eight out of the, how many we played so far, we've been quite a few 7:40 out of 22.
I mean, you made it onto the upper half.
1:02:25
But I mean, you're looking at competing with exactly some of the best games of all time here.
So that's not saying much.
I think that this puts it was it equal to stack Lance?
Yeah.
Equal to streets of Rogue, which we played just recently.
1:02:42
Yeah.
So like not games that I am.
Never going to play this game again.
That's that's the end of it.
I didn't finish it.
Don't really feel need to.
That's just how it is.
I'll go next.
I feel like, as per usual, I'm like somewhere in the middle between will and Scott.
1:03:03
But in this time, in this case, I think it's in the it in a weird way.
It's the I got the worst of both.
I got the Scots like I'm halfway between will and Scott for how much I like Slay, the spire and I'm halfway between for how much I like having narrative in my game and up being just like on the lower half of both.
1:03:29
Like I don't like deck building games enough and I dislike the story aspects too much, so it just kind of was like a Synergy of both of them.
Not being that great.
So I, this is, as 10/10 out of 22, whatever, which is like, right on the edge.
1:03:47
Edge of games that I'm like, yeah, like, yeah, again, I probably won't play it.
I want it.
I put it in my category of games.
I've want to like it.
It's got a lot of things going for it, but it's just, it's a lot.
1:04:04
There's just so much.
And I don't, I don't want to like, there's so many things, you have to learn, and I just felt like I was starting to understand how to play the first character.
And then I looked at the second characters like, Like every keywords different but now you have to learn everything over again and you're in a different town.
1:04:22
In the people, you're fighting have different abilities.
It's like there's a third Carriage driving and looked at it like this is a lot of work and if I really wanted to play Deck Builder game, I would go play a better Deck Builder and I want to play a narrative game.
I could find a better narrative game so it's kind of like it doesn't hit anything.
1:04:42
It's not the best in any, it's a jack of all trades and master of none.
So yeah, I think I'm gonna I'm gonna be I just looked at, I need to have 10 gigabytes of space in order to install disco Elysium.
I think I'm going to delete this game and make room for because my computer is way too full, but I think that's the great idea.
1:05:04
Well, when we have the, the the klei entertainment devs on to judge Wills game when we finally get to that, that'll be a nice thing.
Masterpiece it was an absolute Masterpiece.
I think it's the best thing I've ever thought of in my entire life.
The entire, the whole thing is just not enough romance options, 04, me like, I was walking around yesterday, and I was very confident that this was going to be my new number two game.
1:05:31
And I was like, you know what I really do.
Is a lot of stuff.
I really like about this game.
I'm excited to go back to it.
I really like the art style like unlocking new characters.
Like I'm excited to check like deep dive more of them.
And like the more that I thought about, I think both of you have raised a lot of really great points.
1:05:48
It's just been like tumbling down the rankings, I can agree on now as we've been speaking here.
You're like what to 341 lat?
Yeah, but like it's still I think it's still in good company and I think like Like I kept thinking, like, okay, is this game better than FTL because I kept waffling?
1:06:09
Like well, FTL has like a lot of like bullshit Randomness associated with it and field like doesn't have any story have deals art is kind of Spartan but it's like a titanically iconic game for a reason because like tight.
Yeah it's like it's very it's so tightly designed that.
1:06:26
There's like there's no room for gaps anywhere.
Yeah, so I think like, you know, is Griffin's better than Binding of Isaac.
Oh, I don't know.
Like Binding of Isaac also, random for similar, kind of reasons.
1:06:41
So, like, I think it's, it's kind of like, nestled down into the like Just behind The Binding of Isaac a little bit and just ahead of hand of Fate to just a little bit.
So I think that's like for me, that's good company and that that feels right.
1:06:58
And I probably have to close the spreadsheet.
Now, before it tumbles down any further, but like I think for me like it has a lot of things clicking for it, like okay, like everything is very is much is very clear about.
Like, what, what is happening?
So that I'm not accidentally like oh, I'll click this and oh no.
1:07:17
Like where's my back?
Boston, kind of the things.
So for me, it's my new number five, out of twenty, two games behind Binding of Isaac ahead of hand of Fate to that, that feels right.
The more that I'm kind of waffling around around on it and then that'll put grif lands overall at our new number nine, out of 22, average, averaging out all of our rankings here just behind risk of rain and just ahead of streets of Rogue.
1:07:44
Again, I think like that feels like welcome territories.
Like if people are fans of those games that I think they would be a fan of this to I think, for me this is the best roguelike deck builder that we've played so far and I'm sure that like of the ones that we have coming down the pipe, like it's going to get tight.
1:08:04
Like the it's going to be hard to rank these against each other as time goes.
Oh, just just to get some clarity here.
It, do you think Slade a spider is better than this game?
Well, holy shit.
You said well to that.
1:08:24
I mean, finish your thought, I know some other time.
Yeah, I kind of feel like we should do is lay the Spire episode eventually.
Yeah, that's that.
When we have independently, talk about it so much that we don't really need that.
I was, I was gonna selected for this one but I'm just like well, you know, this is low like that I've already played 8:00 of that one.
1:08:45
Yeah, I guess I need anything to make Scott played all the way and how it once does it does it combine Downfall with slay?
The Spire.
Oh down.
Yeah, the downfall.
Papa, I mean, you've downfall is just a work, I mean, just the most beautiful.
I mean, sorry.
I that's a whole other thing, but it's a beautiful.
1:09:02
So, so yeah, we have we like slay, the Spire, a stay tuned and a half for sure.
But yeah, lots and lots of other roguelike deck, builders including our follow-up episode after this, Would you want your train?
1:09:17
Yeah I'm gonna be doing Monster train and we're going to have a guest appearance by my friend Joe who specifically requested after can remember it was one of the earlier deck building games we did and he was like are you guys going to do Monster train?
1:09:33
If you do, I want to do Monster training so I can argue with Will about whether or not it's better than slow, this fire.
So guess what, their time talking about slay, the Spire again, not better in the context of whether it be monster, train and will.
See if if if it can roll roll its large train oh I've got a lot of thoughts on.
1:09:53
There's there's there's certainly a lot of things to be compared there and I'm sure I'm sure Joey's got a lot of brilliant insights to bring into this and I'm excited to hear what he has to say in a couple weeks someone who's actually made a game.
He might just kidding but is he is like is he as opinionated though because that's really what matters?
1:10:12
Um yeah my contentious I don't know probably not but He has strong opinions as well.
So we'll, we'll have some good times with our in this corner.
We've got a little ride in this corner.
Anything new.
Yeah, it'll be like Star Trek. 4 x 2 Star Wars, where they both probably like both of them but the subtle nuances breed hatred anyway.
1:10:39
Well the two monsters are going to duel each other out as this deck building roguelike train.
Rain continues next week with monster train.
But in the meantime oh yeah, well yeah, I got all these social plugs I got to do, what am I doing here?
1:10:55
This whole things out of order, but it's very important that people know that our email is grog pods own at gmail.com.
It's very important that people know that we have a mastodon were one of 10 people who do and that is grog POD at Game Dev, doubt, plays and it's very important that we have a website on the Grog pod dot Zone Zone, domain, because you can't get Any better than that, really?
1:11:18
So if you want to find all of our, all of our rankings and data and all that stuff that we use to form the show, you can find all that and website.
Yeah.
Next week monster train but in the meantime to play us out is going to be a ballad of a war.
