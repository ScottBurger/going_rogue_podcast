thank you

greetings friends and welcome to yet another episode of The Grog pod roguelike podcast where each episode we try to open and we try to run a game and we try to play it and we try to have a good time big or small and then we try to rank these games as best we can against all the other ones that we've done so far uh I am your host of the garage podcast home button shift tab shift tab Escape numpad one colon Scott Burger and joining me in the evacuation shelter group this week are my podcast co-hosts

old medieval churro who've been time traveled to the future if I did zombies

and uh you go we go I go Migo Andrew the Migo alien who has invaded um I'm the interloper who has invaded this Dimension that is the Grog pod oh and this is will and I'm definitely a brainless zombie just plain and simple mm-hmm well this week we are talking about our average day in downtown Seattle simulator cataclysm Dark Days Ahead release I think look almost every every point in this uh in this intro segment that I have going here is going to have all sorts of weird tangents uh this is a yeah so Air Force this this game was released originally on let's say GitHub January 2nd 2013. uh and recently on Steam March 31st 2023. uh as stated you can find this on PC from the cataclysm Dark Days Ahead website where the quote-unquote main free version is that I think redirect you to kind of all the different different downloads they have where I think there's maybe a different release of this game like twice a day or something uh and then you can find it on Steam for the low low cost of twenty dollars to throw some money towards the main developers way um or if you were some infected by some kind of zombie brain eating disease uh you could also find this on Android uh for the low low cost of free where you can find three different versions of this game you can find the I believe the standard branch cataclys and dark days ahead there's a cataclys and dark days ahead that has in parentheses an X next to it which I think is the experimental Branch I asked on the on the cdda Discord what it was and no one knew what it was uh and then you have uh cataclysm dark days ahead by Michael Davies it I think is the uh the author or publisher or something for that specific one again no one actually knows what that thing is uh I don't think that one's actually supported any more but yeah we'll get there but you can find a whole bunch of different versions of this game uh this game was developed by clear Raven which is not one person but many people uh this game was published on Steam by a fellow that goes by the username of corgent uh who is Curtis Merrill from Jeffersonville Indiana and an accomplished Italian opera singer if you find his YouTube videos very talented I can only sing his Praises in terms of uh of all the stuff that he does but um there's an interest so I'll tangent here there's there's a lot of devs for this game uh we did a couple a few developer interviews some time ago I won't take up the whole show with this but we'll put it in the show notes with uh two interview interviews that we did with uh some other previous developers of this ecosystem if you will and one interview that we did with corgent himself to get some perspective on the latest Steam release and things like that I think there was a little bit of controversy when when that came out we talked about it more but I think when if you go into the show notes you find that link you can find more info about about his perspective on it cataclysm rolls in on our steam data set as the 1700 1073rd most popular roguelike out of something like six thousand uh with roughly let's say 199 somewhere around 200 total reviews um the Google Play Store version of this game is a 4.3 out of 5 with 50 000 plus downloads for comparison I guess maybe not super surprising if it's free um but yeah like I guess our best comparison thus far has been shattered Pixel Dungeon which has about 120 000 plus downloads so um Colin what is the series of menu systems that's going to help us find the one sentence description of what capitals and dark days ahead is uh it's going to be numpad 222 uh G uh left parentheses and then ampersand uh which is down down G forget or grab and then you disassemble the thing and then you can craft it into a extra small left bar birch bark glove uh so that it can fit your weird medieval hand uh because I I I'm sorry so I played the uh I randomly found one of the like things I was like I'm gonna play as the medieval churl who got time travel to the Future and I so I was playing as a person who was illiterate but had like a weird sword uh but yeah uh so this is a survival crafting Rogue with just an exhaustive series of of menus and hotkeys to to do things and uh yeah you can make it all every single thing I think I'm gonna put a a Content or trigger warning for cataclysm fans uh if you've gotten this far into the podcast uh there's there's for me at least this is not going to be uh an objectively fun podcast for you to listen to uh in the immortal words of Lena Haiti uh this will not be over quickly and you will not enjoy this from my perspective uh but yeah I think like we we often say on this show all devs go to heaven and in this case this is going to be the most devs Go to Heaven episode possible because as as I kind of stated before this is an open source game uh with many contributors and many developers throughout the years uh we have pulling from the GitHub stats and I'll compare these with a shattered Pixel Dungeon which is another open source game that we've talked about uh cataclys and dark days ahead on GitHub has a hundred and six thousand total commits or you can think of those as like uh software patches compared to 7000 with shattered pixel dunion uh we have uh cataclysm has 3.8 000 total Forks or versions of the game you can think of compared to 859 with shattered Pixel Dungeon cataclysm has 5 000 plus releases compared to 45 for shattered Pixel Dungeon cataclysm has 1880 total contributors compared to two for shattered Pixel Dungeon uh so yeah I think this this kind of underlines for me the game being um how do I put this being rich with contents and uh oh yeah yeah uh there's a lot of stuff in this game you were saying though sorry I rudely interrupted well yeah okay so uh I think this this game feels very designed by committee For Me Maybe not even designed by committee but like designed by uh Anarchy almost uh I don't know that this game really has like Focus or direction to it uh and I feel like I'm jumping like way ahead into rankings already but maybe we should start where's my uh where's my Google I gotta use my Google docs to focus here Focus the topic of how uh some of the Pod enjoys or really appreciates when like a game is a solo Dev effort like that that factors into the ranking for some of us me included and also the price of the game sometimes factors heavily into the the game so that we're into the game's ranking so this is it puts us in a bit of a conundrum we've got 1100 Developers but the game is also free slash twenty dollars so I don't know it's like that that is blowing my mind I don't know where to put it yeah because on the one hand it should be like the greatest game ever or the worst game ever I I don't know right so so part of the Year 1100 wow okay I think that we know how many of those people are actively working on the like um cultivation of this game any idea I would say somewhere in the range between like 30 and 50. okay with like you know a very kind of like long tailed thing where there's maybe like five or six people who who do it regularly sure um and then uh yeah then you have like a very long tale of people who are like you know what this game needs left-handed guns I'm gonna code in some left-handed guns that you can only use with your left hand into this game bam I've contributed it I'm done technically like listed as a developer on GitHub but that's my contribution peace out see ya right sure gotcha is there is there some individual or like small group of individuals that is actually approving the pull requests that I believe is done by The Who did I say it was clear Raven uh Consortium which I believe is uh Kevin Grand and I think like one other guy I had this in the Google Doc and then I stupidly deleted it later but again this is all kind of we'll put in the show notes it's part of the um the interviews that we did uh but yeah there's there's like a few people who kind of approve the the uh pull requests in in GitHub so I guess like there's some level of like editorial discretion going on there question mark uh you can reject I mean you can reject or or request more effort or like you know say it doesn't pass tests and I think and again I I might be kind of like overstepping my bounds here as as an expert on the subject but I believe that the repo owners are TR like trying to deliberately create a very open Dev environment and if it's like hey you know if you want to like Fork this code and make something that's more to your style by all means but we're like the clear Raven Consortium is going to not blanket approve everything but have a very loose level of moderation I think for stuff that goes in so I I don't you know I don't think there's going to be like that much questionable content going in but hey you want a Porsche 911 Turbo in the game bam there you go it's it's coded approved rubber stamp um but that's not on the main Fork though right like that's that's how I imagine this like when I when you download the game and you play it on your computer getting like the the main version of it which doesn't include all the crazy nonsense I think that is the main version is that how that works okay because I figured that like there's just like a whole bunch of you know if someone who wants that Porsche they're just doing the fourth version but so there's an a a kind of a Schism going on with cataclysm there's a foreign

I'll drop a I'll drop a line here for cataclysm Bright Knights versus dark days and cataclysm bright nights I believe is a fork of cdda That's supposed to be more more streamlined less of less simulationist uh Insanity more kind of focus There's an actual like end state to the game like you can trigger an end of the game in Bright Nights uh there are things like um no cbms locked behind exodiai faction no removed pneumatic or sci-fi weapons or items which existed in the game originally uh no Exodia faction period no effects on conditions Json or brand new vitamins-based mutation system uh so those kinds of things right uh the yeah um where do we even begin with this uh this is a game about Zombie Survival probably me personally my least favorite genre possible so when will will Colin in the gang are like hey there's a new Open Access early early access zombie open world survival game I'm just like open world survival crafting zombie game I mean I mean seven days to die is one of the greatest games of all time and the forest which is a good game sons of the forest zombies but it's weird weird survival crafting these are good genres Scott's wrong on this objectively I mean it's it's okay to like a game even if you are suffering from a a brain amoeba uh so I thought like you know open world survival zombie crafting this has got will and Colin written all over it me not so much this is kind of stacking the deck a little um but in this game Our Story begins where it's not just one apocalypse it's all your favorite apocalypse is rolled into one you got plagues you got zombies you got interdimensional demon invasions you got spore-like creatures you name it uh your character has awoken uh in New England somewhere uh procedurally generated Town names but somewhere in the USA uh in the present day ish 20 xd6 time frame uh in an alternate reality uh where bionics I guess are common depending on the fork that you're playing uh and Your Story begins about five days after the event called the cataclysm uh where you are involved in the changing of the mundane routine world of civilization and you have to learn how to survive uh and that's that's kind of it you are kicked out the door into [Music] uh a series of Unix terminal menus uh with character creation and world world gen setup and and all that fun stuff uh I know I know for a fact that Colin and will you guys have both played Dwarf Fortress the very new extent Andrew what's your experience with Dwarf Fortress oh I have always admired Dwarf Fortress and I intended to play it at some point but I have uh watched it from afar and you know enjoyed reading green text stories and Reddit threads of tales of high adventure and dwarf forestry right it's about forestry uh no uh but so I'm aware of it but I've never actually played it uh but yeah definitely when I uh sat down to play cataclysm uh the first similar game that came to mind was tour Fortress Yeah this reminds me of the pre-steam version of Dwarf Fortress which I tried and failed to play multiple times and yeah uh menus where you go into the menu and oh my cursor is on the left column I would like to go to the right which arrow key should I click oh of course it's left so that you go to the right that seems like Scott and I were talking about that uh when he was streaming his his little game for us and it's like uh yeah like just memorize all the hotkeys that's how I feel like that's the way that you need to learn how to play this game watch YouTube videos that are out of date uh memorize the hotkeys uh figure out which which things that they tell you are no longer current um and then run around and get eaten by a dragonfly yeah maybe maybe this is a place to start uh because you can't really just you can't jump in and just start playing this game casually um uh how so maybe this is a place to start how many hours of tutorial videos did each of us watch I watched approximately I don't know somewhere between 90 minutes and like two hours I think approximately I would say by ratio of playing to watching tutorial videos is one to one and I played like five hours wow

they weren't all tutorial videos I watched some like role play e-videos because that's how I shout out to uh worm girl sure yeah like there are a couple of a couple of them that uh I ended up watching uh but like that's how I interacted with Dwarf Fortress for a very long time was through like a crook smash or uh you know yes the green text stories so like I'm familiar with the concept of games that I don't actually like playing but enjoy watching the creative content that comes out of them and so after I bounced off this game the first time I was like okay I want to like watch someone play this in a way that I enjoy as a way to like prime the pump to make me want to play it because I want to see how I could have fun because it doesn't show you how you could have fun you have to you have to trust on Blind Faith that you might get enjoyment out of it eventually it's it is a it is not a learning curve it is a learning wall

we'll put it we'll put so that was I guess like I'm I'm interested about how how learning this game now compares to how you have learned to have fun with Dwarf Fortress in the past because Colin you put you've put some a good chunk of hours into the into the steam door Fortress release I put a good chunk of hours into the the free steam version and I mean I didn't get anywhere right but but did this because this is like a brand new experience uh did this feel easier or harder than your Dwarf Fortress experience from in the past

um probably easier uh like

it has like at least the the things in it it's still like you are a character doing things so like okay I don't know what the buttons are I have to like scroll through but eventually you find something oh you click s to smash you click W to where or W uh apple w obvious Little W to wield or whatever it's like okay like there's not the like yeah deep intellectual challenge of trying to figure out like what zones are and how to do militias in polar Fortress which are like these are not naturally intuitive things um like the management system of Dwarf Fortress is like this is requires you to like understand like what's going on in the game versus this game you could just like kind of run around and smash things and you can just play it as that uh you don't even really into craft so you just grab stuff put it on go run around get killed by a zombie so like the the barrier to like your first death is slightly lower

um but still difficult like you just it's a lot of time looking at that help menu just being like I don't know what to button to push I want I wanted I desperately wanted to be able to right click on things they'd be like tell me all of the things that I can do in this Square because otherwise I'm just like randomly clicking buttons eventually one of them will like smash a window or something

yeah no that's that's that all sounds about right I mean that was my experience too like the first I went in blind and I'm just like all right here we go new game all right I haven't actually ever enjoyed a rogue like game as I describe which is actually is to say one turn everything moves when you move that that's how I'm gonna describe it um and I was like I'm ready to really get into one this looks like Dwarf Fortress all right oh man these menus and just like you're saying um I knew right away that I just like after the first play through getting eaten by a zombie after kicking a dog or something like that I just I just I'm not going to uh I'm not gonna invest the time to like find out if this is fun by myself I need to see I watch someone else see is there fun in it and so I switch over to like watching some videos and yeah it's a lot of I mean I I get the you know beard scratching like oh okay like there's a bunch of zombies here and here and you're on a roof and you're like can I get through them in order to get out of the city is like where 90 of the time of like all these people are doing and then they get out and then suddenly oh no a a Yumi appears on screen this is giant cat it's like much faster than you and it's just like oh I lost right there because he entered my screen and he saw me and I have absolutely no way of escaping him and I have no way of finding it that's just the end of the game and so it's like it's a it's a hard punishing game where it's just like all right you just keep doing that over again over again but like the time it takes to do that is intense because you start the game and you have to rummage through the house and when you're like wherever you're starting and you're just like going through the menu slowly getting some like anti microbials and all these little tiny things and then you finally try and get out and then you have like a 95 chance of dying before anything interesting happens and um that and maybe maybe it's not quite that bad when you get to the the expert expert level where you're like oh yeah I can just [ __ ] parkour off this door and just backflip up here and then I can safely step down here and like punch the zombie in the face easy I I never got to that level and um I think I think the reason I'm not going to give a super low rating here which I already know like what you're you're thinking uh is because if I did Master all of these things I can see the fun in the premise of this game I can see how the the intense depth of it could be really entertaining if you were just a master of the the menus and you got everything immediately and all the decisions all the time that you were spending was making crucial gameplay decisions that seem interesting as opposed to trying to find the thing that describes what a thing is so that's that's kind of how I feel about that I spent a lot of time like like there the course simulation behind it seems like I could have fun doing that I think will you're in the same boat as me absolutely yeah like this like we're both very into simulationy type games and this is a deep deep simulation it is I mean you got you got like the arch of your foot the toes of your feet like every little part of your foot is model your hand your your lips like you can you can go in Exquisite depth here but then also you have to go into Exquisite depth and so like I'm like Oh I wanna I'm this medieval churro I want to like get rid of my cloth loin or my loincloth rag thing and where like uh cargo pants and like the I I found myself in a house I'd kill the Zombies in the house and I had all of the stuff that should have been necessary to like make clothes and the effort that it took to figure out how to tear down the curtains and make it into long strings and then make those long strings into short strings and make those short strings into threads and then get the the other things so that you could make the cargo pants and then get the sticks so that you oh you got to drag the stick because you can't carry the stick because you don't have enough pockets and like just like and trying to figure out what you're close to being able to build or what you should be trying to do but like I would just open up my crafting menu every once and I'll be like oh cool there's new things I can build I guess like I oh I want to do this like how do I make thread like I had to go I had to go ask chat GPT how to make thread in cdda because the internet wasn't good enough I'm like I just need to make I mean actually thread's not that hard but like it's just like I don't want to have to look up on the like leave the game to look up every single crafting item to figure out how to like what does an all how do I make a you know what's a staff and distal so I can make yarn they need the chat gbt plug-in for the game and then you're just in the game and you could just query it right there that's actually not the worst idea that I've heard for this channel I mean it's open source why not like yeah just like literally have it they'll be like I would like to make cargo pants what do I need oh wait now that um animation that I can like I can understand images I wonder if you're able to say hey based on the screenshot right here what do you think I should do and like get some like I don't know like oh that'd be cool is like the cataclysm is a it's not a simple game but it's it's got input that you could put into an AI more easily than many other games it's text-based it's uh it's you know Sprite and pixel and tile based you could absolutely have that fed into uh the AI which is like a directly understand what you're looking at

I think so there's a lot of menus and a lot of depth and you're learning all these controls and I have kind of maybe a potentially rude question I I will admit that um you know this isn't really my sort of Survival game I'm more of a like Don't Starve type survival game player um so maybe I'm not the target audience uh and I commend every one of the 1100 cataclysm survivors that have contributed to this game but hey uh there's over a thousand releases on GitHub and not a one of them is fun you're learning all of these you're memorizing all these controls and there's all this incredible depth and I just I don't know I kept asking myself and I'll ask all of you like to what end because Master the elements to survive they come to fortify against the uh your stockpile so you can weather the storm and the big things that are coming for you

it sounds very exciting I don't know if the game conveys any of that sense of accomplishment you gotta go so okay I'll I'll give you the actual like the one moment that I had that I felt like I had true fun um which was in the first troll that I played that died uh I was like sleeping in some like patch of woods drinking out of a puddle and something snuck up on me it was a dog and then I followed the dog uh back to The Farmhouse where there were uh I was ambushed by zombie cows and I had a desperate flight into the house trying to like uh uh kill a cow with my dagger sword thing like get it stuck in the window and like stabbing it as it's trying to get through and then trying to like retreat further into house like let my bleed my wounds and like wait and hope that I can like hide and another cow came in and I'm like desperately backed into a corner trying to stab this cow and I killed it but then I heard the third cow and I'm like I gotta run I'm like maybe I can make a break for it I smashed through the window and try to run I was like I jumped over the fence I was like yes I've escaped and then it just smashed through the fence and came and just kicked me down and hooved me to death

Thriller moment um yeah no I see I got excited for a moment because I thought what I thought you were saying is that your weapon got stuck in the window but no it was like you were trying to get the enemy stuck in the window is that am I understanding that correctly yeah I see well that's interesting you know right you were trying to where their numbers will count for nothing where the cows numbers will count for nothing I remember that scene in 300. yeah um I just I feel like all of the activities available in this game and all the quote exciting stories of people playing this game it feels like activities and experiences that I've had more successfully in other games and that are that are available so maybe I'm just not the target audience I don't know um I don't think you're wrong I think that the developers I was listening to a a Ye Old episode of another roguelike podcast that I'll be one of those people to show for other programs uh roguelike radio did an episode with uh the developers years and years ago and they were talking specifically about like hey you know like we can we can kind of go one of two ways with development for this we can either do like really deep simulationist type stuff all outdoor Fortress or we could do a more kind of like streamlined like focused on like a specific story sort of thing and I believe that they opted specifically for the simulationist aspect in order to like allow like there was I think at the time the biggest debate in the cataclysm world was like what do you call the containers that you put milk in between like either either like yeah like is it a jug or is it the other kind of name for a Jung just like oh my God this is just it's it's just a bunch of like programmers with no supervision let loose on the internet and like throwing as much stuff into a game as they possibly can which is fine I feel like there's there's interesting stuff here that's overlooked as a result though uh like as I was typing out these notes I'm like wait a minute there's a lot of like parallels between ideas here with like half-life post-apocalypse zombie or like different types of like um alien monster invasions trying to survive in the open world and I kept thinking like man there would be like a really good idea for like a half-life style rogue rogue style Survival game here where it's after it's after the black Mesa incident the monsters are like zapping in everywhere and you have to survive and find uh uh Marines Breen's compound to surviven uh cataclysm has a bunch of different factions it has maybe like seven seven different human factions one of which is the Tacoma commune just down the I-5 from here wow uh we have uh the X X e037 The Blob the I think this is supposed to be the the main antagonist to all factions this is the thing that's the cataclysm this is the thing that's invading the Earth the thing that's animating all the zombies yeah uh you have fungal intelligence you have a plant monsters you have Super Monsters of some other ilk uh things that like are I guess reminiscent of the combine from Half-Life question mark uh you have post-human cyborg travelers from other cataclysm affected Dimensions you have autonomous locus-like robots with incomprehensible inner workings and you have a human created military artificial intelligence Network named Balthazar uh that I think you can load a nuke into and nuke nuclear your uh rated game instance all interesting stuff that you would never know existed if you didn't get pummeled by a child-sized dragonfly five minutes into trying to get to the Evac or the refugee shelter uh as we experienced in our stream last night um there's magic in this game too like there's actual magic systems uh there's all sorts of crazy nonsense but like I feel like like none of which really like is focused on because there's just so much other stuff happening um one of which is like is car driving I think that's like one of the it seems like one of the biggest draws like the most popular activity is building your strange uh grid like race for the Galaxy style um car and then driving it around and the way that like when you're driving at an angle and it like segments all the pieces out and it's like a super pixelated thing is very endearing and and entertaining um yeah that's uh I right like it seems like every time I watch a lot of the videos and things that I've seen have been about the the Mad Max isms about it and I do want to mention because I I've been you know pretty negative so far the actual uh like flavor and story of the type of cataclysm and the type of Invaders Alien Invaders is probably one of the most more one of the better parts of the game I think it's like kind of it's it's pretty interesting and engaging and I was you know reading through some of the wiki and everything it's not just a generic Zombie Invasion like there's a little more going on um in my experience of the game uh that interesting stuff was not really portrayed very interestingly in the mechanics or in the gameplay unfortunately but maybe I just didn't get far enough um real briefly I had an experience with a vehicle in that I managed to find a car near the uh evacuation shelter and um I popped in it and I did not quite fully understand the controls and we basically I drove it through the wall of the evacuation Center and made it pretty much no longer a very good uh place to uh to hold up uh so I felt a little bit bad about that a bit bad to leave the NPC high and dry like that um but uh and then I drove away I drove into another building and then I finally figured out how to get out of the car and figured let's let's just I'll leave it at that that's about enough driving for me that's right that's right I didn't even get to a car so uh congratulations on getting back thank you I got into a car and then I looked around in the car and I tried to figure out how to make it work and my guys this was not my troll my troll is a philosophically opposed to cars which gave me eight extra points to spend or something like that like a lot and that hey that brings us to what I think is another Pro of this game is the different character traits and features and the level of detail this is a level of detail where I'm like oh okay this is neat this does work for me as opposed to what I was talking about earlier which is yeah when you fire up a game like the Character Creator is very in-depth and pretty interesting and like if you randomly roll a character uh that was kind of a highlight of each playthrough it's like starting it off and then like opening up the character screen which can be accessed conveniently with shift two and looking at my pros and my cons and and everything like after a bunch of tutorial watching I felt like all right at one point I felt like okay I think I'm ready to embark on a semi-serious run here and I'm gonna I know what I'm gonna do the first thing I'm gonna do is in the evacuation Center I'm going to talk to the NPC I'm gonna see if they have any activities any any tasks for me to do and so I fired it up random character walked over to the NPC and then I was greeted in the dialogue options with uh sorry you were actually deaf um so you're not gonna be able to converse with this NPC I was like okay interesting um but uh what I lacked in the ability to hear I made up for in Firepower uh I started off with a nice little Arsenal so that was convenient um but yeah I like I think it's pretty cool that there's like so many different options and so much granularity to the character creation would this game be better as a tabletop RPG no absolutely not I'm glad you brought that up I would like to encourage all the cataheads out there the cataclysm players that I I think they would really like some tabletop RPG playing I think I think you could get a perhaps a more fulfilling and interesting uh experience out of out of a ttrpg um with a good you know GM possibly yeah okay there are also car combat games that exist that's also uh an option um and it's just a sense I get but um I don't know your questions Scott but yeah okay yes I see I see now where after Andrew I think yeah human human brain make simulation not computer game big simulation right if you had a character sheet that was like as large and as in-depth like like a direct one-to-one conversion to a tabletop game no probably not but like uh this sort of setting and concept in a ttrpg environment I think would be but it would be good in my opinion what do you think Scott of your own question I mean like my note in the Google Doc here is that like when traditional rogue rogue style games like this and we'll see how caves of cut shapes out in over the next few months uh but when games like this get overly complicated to a point they kind of like Aura boros back onto themselves of becoming like a a pen and paper RPG from which they originally like sprung forth from the head of the OG Rogue to try to solve right so I think the development history is like back in the 1980s they developed Rogue as like a way of like well I don't have any friends but I like playing D so we'll we'll make this thing that kind of splits the difference a little bit with the tech they had at the time and now it's just gotten like kind of like full circle moment backed like there's so much stuff in here just printed out on paper and you might have a better time I I feel like um so what was it like a few days ago I had uh a very generous tutor from the roguelikes Discord the snack uh who who walked me through like all the all the different stuff like hey you should pick a cybernetic gangster because they have like a Mega Man style like arm blaster on them great perfect idea you should uh start with the scenario here it's the easiest got it uh you should go navigate through these menus okay perfect he like this was a very like like gentle gmifying of this game system where I was like I I have experience with door Fortress like I'm I'm not no uh no newbie to like yeah come on you're not scared of a little you're not afraid of a little ASCII UI like but like when and I will say like the menu systems here uh are many and they are verbos I will say that they are probably better than the OG door Fortress yes um but that's not saying much uh and like there's just this is like a game you need a Wiki up on one monitor you need the main game on another monitor and then you need a coach in the room to tell you what to do in order to find where the fun is this is all just a UI issue though right what you're describing is not a over in my opinion I mean I still I agree with it pretty much everyone here saying it's not fun games as it is as it is right but like the concept of it and the idea of the deep stimulation I don't think is one that you can disparage so easily because what you're describing is just like oh I don't get it because the UI is so clunky and I I want to know how to do something but I have no easy way of doing that again like if if we go back to the Cog mine discussion like the the big outcome for me out of that was like just make this look like into the breach and give me like better like UI and suddenly this game goes from Total dog [ __ ] sorry but to like something that I really love and in this in a similar fashion to this game is like if you just had a UI and maybe maybe it's not a like a top down sort of like like I know that's how this is like designed right now but like I know call you and I have talked about like these really deep simulation like what's the what's the fantasy game we have it's a deep simulation where it's like a 3D thing where everything's procedurally generated and it's um uh uh you know yeah a version of can't you I mean like that does have like there's a very specific like an important uh uh uh uh management of the landscape everything's custom made and I think they do that very well it's not actually kenshi is actually very much not in the realm of procedurally generated but it's more it's more emergent than procedural but right yeah yeah the immersion in battles is a nice stuff that's all that's all very great but so I think is possible the procedural is possible but only if it's done right and I just don't think we've seen it done right I think this is a good point will if uh you know if we just if this game just had Mouse controls and you can right click all those options as you were saying Colin like so I've learned the hotkeys the difference between the Kit Fox steam Dwarf Fortress version and the OG Dwarf Fortress is substantial like I did not end up playing like I didn't end up being like Oh the new Dwarf Fortress is my favorite game but I did play it I put a bunch of hours into it and being able to like right click on things and having like a good menu system made a world of difference in terms of being able to figure out what was going on yeah like I yeah I was like oh which button do you push just like it gets tiring to have to look it up again and yeah I like because you're learning like you're learning almost a programming language for the game instead of learning like I know how to play video games like just let me play the damn video game right I don't need to learn C plus plus in order to have fun here maybe that's why there's so many contributors because uh they're like oh yeah coding is more fun yeah the next game that we're working on so my I I guess for for a Roblox podcast we have not played very many true old school broke like games so I I am curious how much of this is us being like when I tried to teach my mom how to play portal and she's like I don't know how to walk I don't think this is a broglite game no but like the G forget or like all of the different uh hotkey shortcuts like how much of those are in the old school roguelike games I don't I don't really know ironically too many of them ironically I think those older games are probably way simpler because they are simpler but I wonder if this is just an expansion of that where it's like half of the like oh you click at to see your character it's like well that doesn't make sense to us but it's like at is the symbol for your character in real life games yeah like that's it's like it's the equivalent of saying like uh click click I for inventory it's like yeah I can click at for yourself because that's you so I wonder how much of it is us not understanding the like old school design language of roguelike games well I think like there's there's UI there's ux and accessibility right yeah and coming flake coming to cogmines defense here uh like Cog mines like art artistic style is very traditional roguelikey tile based Graphics I mean credit to cataclysm here you can zoom in and out of the game can't do that in COG mine kind of a kind of a plus in right quality of life thing that should be in all of these tile based games yeah exactly um good job but yeah like cogmind you can play almost entirely just with the mouse new Dwarf Fortress you can do that uh Kit Fox has been yeah like they did like that that huge uh polishing pass on dwarf like just the fact that you can play Dwarf fortress on the steam deck now is like landing on the moon level of human accomplishment I think so and Kit Fox Now is like is turning their their focus onto caves of cud for a similar kind of polishing pass which like you know Standing Ovation debt like I mean cut probably playable before it but for me I think definitely deserves that kind of uh accessibility overhaul on it I could see if Kit Fox took an overhaul pass on cataclysm forked it to like the kit fox version where hey we're gonna put in an end goal we're gonna put in like some more uh less aggressively anti-user pattern uh menu navigation and we're gonna make it a snare a scenario that's a tutorial well yeah I mean like there there is the quote-unquote tutorial in here but I I almost felt I almost left the tutorial more confused than when I started uh which I did not I did not demo for our stream because I don't know if it would have been that helpful to be honest uh yeah I mean just go watch YouTube videos instead yeah but like there's there's interesting stuff I think in this game that's really locked behind its aggressive uh and like borderline proud uh obtuseness where like you watch you watch like the content creators on YouTube and they're having a good time they're generating all these interesting and cool stories at it like great I would like to engage and like make those also cool stories without getting beaten to death by an emu 10 turns in uh but it's just every time I fired up the game it was just I felt the energy draining out of my brain of just like I'm programming all day long the last thing I want to do is jump into more obtuse menus and again God help uh or you know thank you the snack from the Discord who I'm surprisingly is an assembly programmer so you can definitely see that this game would be catnip for for that person uh but yeah like this there's interesting stuff here that you just need so like a flood of ux and accessibility programmers to jump into that GitHub and start throwing those pull requests in there

is it just 100 software Engineers that play this game that's why it is what it is I can't imagine any people with like an art degree would jump into this game well I mean there are tile makers so there are yeah like and again this game accomplished artists this game comes pre-packaged with tiles which again Standing Ovation a sort of Rarity to see for traditional like big big pillared Rogue style games I mean if you like if you like the Maxis The Sims you should like this right it's the same sort of game I think that's uh yeah that's not at all there's no overlap there I think if you were a programmer at the game at the studio that makes the Sims and you're like oh boy I love programming simulations then you're probably firing this on your laptop on the bus ride home so I think Sims is actually uh not not the Sims uh Sim City is an interesting comparison to a game like this because they're they are both very much simulation games and there's a lot of stuff that's going on behind the scenes in SimCity but you don't really have a way of affecting them so you don't have to deal with it as much I feel like this game has an overwhelming amount of systems that you must engage with immediately I like I made wooden clogs for my feet so I could get rid of my rags and it's like ah now your feet are chafing it's like now you must make socks so your feet don't your your arch of your foot is chafing I'm like ah like

I like that it is simulating all of you but like even like something like Dwarf Fortress where it's like oh you know it's simulating all when you when your dwarves get in combat it's like the right uh fat abdominal fat has been bruised it's like cool great I don't actually need to to know about that I'm just I love that it's doing it in the background and it's fun to like read it in the stories but you don't actually need to be like ah I better make a right abdominal fat protector armor you're not the one managing that level of complexity exactly exactly so in like SimCity you there's like oh it's calculating all the like figuring out where all the people are going and whatnot but you don't really have a way of controlling that granularity you're dealing with things on a more macro level um I don't want to deal with the 10 different kinds of flour that you can make I wanted to be like cool you got you got like here's some things you can make a sandwich um it's just Food Source One Food Source two yeah and maybe the special food source three and maybe if you like want to engage on a deeper level you if you to like eke out that extra five or ten percent you're like ah yeah you know you get your macronutrients perfect and it makes you a little bit better cool great but you don't need to do that immediately to survive at all yeah yeah you're like you're in a kitchen there's like there's definitely food around here but like I don't oh I don't know how to like make this sandwich it's like I don't know just put the things together and eat it well your sandwich making skill was zero so there you go yeah yeah like the civilizing another simulation right and like the city management is the same way like you don't have to open up your city and like control where all of yours like uh your population like goes to like control exactly how much production's happening um you can just like let the city run and then it's gonna produce normal amounts or you can go in there and micromanage all that stuff but it had a very good UI for that and so like if you want to ignore it it does its thing naturally and if you want to go there and like be really uh particular about it you can and I think that that's that's an example of a really great implementation of this and I think I don't know how that would I mean I'm trying to imagine like how that would work in this game I mean the only the only way I really think it works is if like yeah foods have like like there's just a slider of like not difficulty but complexity and so like foods are just like they they go from like the most complex different sorts of flowers and ingredients and like you turn the scale to the most idiot like where it's something good for me anyways and it would be like it is just like this makes this makes food bar go up and like you don't have to worry about all the like oh my salt management and my you know what's my cholesterol levels right now oh my God my ldls yeah well I mean like you could do something where it's like uh there's a recipe that's just like food Mash it just like put calories in squish it all together because it's like all the recipes they have like very specific recipes like I ate a wheat free bread Jam sandwich it's like that is an extremely high level of like the fact that it's not like oh like someone is there why is there wheat-free bread and like this specific cucumber sandwich is different than Jam sandwich like you could extract you could like simplify that down to sandwich and gives you 10 percent less food benefit in exchange for a 100 less mental complexity to deal with and then later once you're a god tier you're just like uh you you you've burned the mouse and you you are you're cutting an emacs and like just your fingers are flying across the screen or across the keyboard then you get into your uh your wheat-free Jam sandwiches uh and you compare the the literal like you oh I gotta get more calcium in my diet from the milk in this fridge Colin Emax is a rogue light this is a roguelike podcast so we can only talk about them here I don't actually know what your next is programming stuff

so the game uh like aesthetically is like very simple and it's very you know um you know systems driven which is like there's something to be said for that like there's not like a bunch of needless fluff like everything means something um and like it's very like tangible and like trackable and it kind of goes back to what we were saying earlier about how oh you could feed that information to chat GPT um the way I've thought about it with like these really simple looking but very sophisticated behind the scene games is that like there's this bargain being struck it's like you're giving up usability and you're giving up pretty Graphics to have these cool complicated systems that can interact with each other and produce like unique and interesting and engaging situations and that is what has always Enchanted me about or Fortress and I'm just like spitballing here but like every other thing that I'd read about Dwarf Fortress would be like oh uh yeah I was playing in my Fortress and I invited like uh a group of uh visitors from a neighboring Fortress and during this um Summit we were having in the in the Mead Hall a goat broke in and started an argument and started a fight and that caused uh the relations between the two fortresses to go south which culminated in a war which resulted in me having to like break open a lava Dam to like kill the Invaders and then uh that ended with like my dwarves uh just you know of their own accord erecting a statue to uh you know glorify the person who broke down the dam no no they directed it to the goat they erected it to the goat yeah like cool [ __ ] like that and so I was I was hoping that there was similarly cool stories to be told in this game so I went looking for them and they're all what able to find where like old stories so maybe the game's way better now I don't know um but they're all very similar to your story Colin where it's like here is a story about how I got killed by something and when they break it down into its simplest parts these stories aren't that interesting it's like I went to X location X enemy attacked me and I died in x-wave and like it's a lot of stories of like of those sorts of situations and I was reading one thread where it's like all right now we're cooking now we're now we're in a situation this guy's talking about how he has this base and this person has this base set up and a Jabberwocky monster which is this horrible like gibbering Mather like the thing monster breaks in and he has to and he so he he escapes and it's basically he has to work on getting back his fort and like oh cool are there gonna be some like some neat Like Home Alone Styles sophisticated traps or something where he's gonna come up with some really clever cool because again we got all these like detailed systems that hopefully should be interacting and hopefully should be resulting in like cool stuff uh is he gonna have to do something neat like that MacGyver it and and get this monster out no uh he ends up just like sort of uh uh uh aggroing the monster and guiding it outside I'm like all right cool he's got a plan something's going on what's the plan he jumps in his car and and drives away and he just baits the monster away and then he in the third the story's like and then I came up with this idea and then I had an idea and I was like all right sweet he's gonna activate the like James Bond like you know the features of his car and turn around and like do some cool put down on oils like light it on fire I don't know I'm just spitballing here um again this is kind of things that you could have if you've got a GM running a post-apocalyptic game for you anyway uh nope that's not what happens his grand plan is just to do a 180 and drive away and the monster then stopped chasing him and I was like what where are the cool stories what is it what is what are we doing all this for what are we hurting our our faces against the keyboard for and learning all these systems all those rules just so we can get killed in like kind of unique ways a lot of these stories that I read about cool stuff happening I felt like could be accomplished with a game of you know just just like just just an improv game I don't know anyway I'm getting you well I'm getting yeah I worked up where where are my lava dams I was I was thinking that like he was gonna turn the car around and run over the monster with his car that was more interesting in a very like horror movie style comedy Factor but yeah like you would think a game that has like um like something I think there's like uh yeah you have like Skynet you have the combine and you have the blob all in the same game where is like I never encountered any of this like I never encountered like any any hint that like any of this cool stuff was in here get a human-sized dragon or child-sized dragonfly attack you I mean and I I did my damnedest and Colin and Andrew will attest to this to swing my acoustic guitar at it but I was I was just not not skilled enough and you'd think you'd be able to hit a child-sized dragonfly with an acoustic guitar pretty easy but uh I guess I didn't have uh my MP3 player charged up enough to give me enough of morale boost to swing in its direction to intercept but uh but yeah it uh it tore me to pieces and you had that was in the game where we started it on easy mode right yeah that was like the easiest difficulty level in the smallest world and my tutor was uh was saying like if you can get in the evacuee scenario and we haven't really talked about the scenarios but there's a whole bunch of them evacuee scenario the easiest one if you can get from there to the refugee shelter which is like I don't know like 25 to 30 minutes of gameplay that's like an intermediate level of of skill and I'm like okay that like that doesn't sound too hard on like the easiest mode bam dead bam dead bam damn like it just it doesn't feel like it has that hook of like oh I died oh that's I died because of this factor I didn't account for haha right I'm gonna account for it again this time it just feels like I have no control over the Umi appears on your screen it's faster than you that's it I feel like yeah will you talk about making just like the fun comes from making interesting decisions and I feel like the decision was don't have that thing be near you roll the dice better yeah yeah I mean that's honestly like some of the gameplay I was watching was like is like yep he has to get on top of this roof and there's like every single time he gets off of a roof there's like a you roll a dice about whether or not you break your leg when you get down he's like you there's no other way to get through the scenario you just have to get on the roof and like all right are we gonna restart the game now let's find out drop down oh broke my legs there's no ropes in this Rich simulation I mean like he's just like just like he had some specific goals like I'm saying difficulty or something but I see I see thousands of hours with this player I'm just like I'm trying to watch the pro like you get a sense and like you gotta leave it up to just a random dice so I hope I don't break my legs right and 90 of the game was like well do I take do I take the dice roll to go on top of the roof this route or do I run this way and see if I I think let's see if he's gonna ride this speed and I'm right here am I gonna calculate it so that he won't grab me what's the probability of me grabbing me it's just like yeah that is a little bit uh I mean to some extent I get it because like tactical like sort of decision making is super it can be super fun but um there has to be a decision to make in order for it to be fun decision making and I feel like the decisions were not usually by the time I was making decisions it was already too late because the decision was too close how hard do I fight before I run away and I'll die either way

should we get to ratings I feel like how long how far I think yeah we're we're definitely in the rating zone now um maybe I'll go first I think I probably have the most negative things to say about this uh despite like I I tried so hard so so hard to jump into this and be like okay we even have like an extra month because we failed to do our homework last time I'm gonna like jump in I'm gonna try all the different launchers and stuff and it's just like every time I felt like I was hitting a brick wall of enthusiasm of like yeah the character creation menu is fun but like you know there's like a million other games that have better character creation stuff in it if I just want to play Paper Doll mode all day um the like the menu system We've joked about a lot but like it's it's not even just like what's displayed in it's like how you get to it is like doesn't make any sense to me without having like mult like like a NASA style screen of like monitors each with like different Wiki pages of okay what's what's the hotkey that I need in order to put a left shoe on versus my right shoe just is like bafflingly complex for no reason uh the steam release I understand the the need for the developers to have like an official presence on Steam I don't have a problem with that but the price is like way too high for what this game is uh Tales of magical a stay tuned and a half for sure uh kind of similar design uh background as cataclysm uh but that game is five dollars on Steam and it like it it kind of doesn't compute for me of like well why is one of like the other game four times more expensive for like a tenth as much fun um I'm particularly biased against zombie survival games I don't think the genre is very interesting uh I think this game suffers from Walking Dead itis of like there's no goal and that's the whole point uh and it's a game about nothing

[Laughter] I mean are we talking about is it overcast why is it so dark outside hey get a lighter get a flashlight uh but I will say I'll say some good stuff here um being able to zoom in and out is an underrated aspect for this game uh the character creation options are are uh many and are interesting enough to like pick and choose like oh yeah maybe I am allergic to vegetables and I I hate them and I only meat eating and I have cybernetic rollerblades okay sure um I think the background lore of the game is super cool but like let me engage with that more like I want to be able to build like more more easily build up a compound of NPCs and like have like the humans wage war against like the combine equivalent of this game that sounds cool I want to do something like that um and then uh oh yeah like when you equip stuff your your character sprite changes visually that's like something that we've come like kind of complained about other games uh probably no easy feat in this game with how much clothing options there are um and well that's where ten thousand developers were working on that I mean yeah it probably seems like it uh and I like the scenario starts in this game I like the fact that like oh you can choose like oh yeah definitely I was a helicopter pilot and I ran out of fuel and had to land in a bridge and I gotta go go to the airport to get fuel and bring it back for my helicopter like that sounds like an interesting goal to achieve if I just didn't get eaten by a blob five minutes into gameplay um so for me this game I had this game like rated as high as like 26 out of 33 on my list and I just I couldn't do it I couldn't like after that stream yesterday I was like no this has solidified my position as my second lowest game on my list just ahead of Realm of the Mad God and just behind a valley without wind this game was like like actively physically unpleasant for me to play because like I I I amend and I applaud the content that people produce out of this I think this that's much more interesting than playing the game go and watch those videos go and like download 10 hours of rikon role play videos of him doing like a nuclear facility escape sequence like that's cool to listen to when you're on your drive like invest your time in that like for me personally I don't want to invest any time more into learning the systems of this game at all so for me 32 out of 33 uh that's where it's gonna land

yeah I'll jump in um let's see here uh where do I place it I um 33 out of 33. no no no no no I think I mean I'm gonna give it a better rating I don't I I the way I'm kind of ranking this one is looking at like the other games on my list here and like kind of feeling like you know what where what which would I really prefer to play here and it doesn't make it too high up on the list um but like like compared to brotato we get brotato's got a 4.5 here I gotta say I think I would rather play this game than brotato um I I know you're giving me the oh you know you know this is a crazy decision uh but um there's just so much I feel like and I Know It talked about this before the podcast but like it's one of those things where I feel like if I was locked in a room and I had to just play a game forever I think eventually once you go up that wall of complexity I think there is some like real fun to be had here I think that once you get up that wall this problem this game is probably like a seven out of ten but I'm not up that wall um and so in reality it's probably even lower than what I'm going to give it I'm giving it this rating in with the expectation that if I was to climb some way up the wall then it gets better and I'm kind of taking the average of these I think right now I give the game a 3 out of ten if I was gonna say like what do you I mean like right now how do you feel oh God no I just I really don't want to even think about learning the menu systems and like all the minutia of the threads and the short threads and the long no it's a three out of ten but to kind of split the difference here I'm gonna give it a five I think that uh it's I'm giving it a 5 out of ten which makes it my 17 out of 30 however many uh 32 um games we've rated or uh 32 for me anyways I know I skipped I wasn't here for the last time but perhaps uh this is not the the space for for uh for discussion and debate uh but if we're not mistaken five is the minimum

the story that I I just told uh a little while back about out driving away and and out running a uh a Jabberwocky it did start with a NPC sneaking into this person's base and stealing something and then and then the the Jabberwocky was sort of let in as a result of that that's interesting like the game needs sort of like more of that these complicated in-depth um simulation systems like interacting and uh interesting emergency gameplay yes yes so I think that perhaps I feel like maybe this game is uh what has been built so far these simulation systems could be taken and and made into something really amazing potentially it is it is not amazing for me um I feel like most of the sort of like victories and triumphs and achievements in this game at least at the level that I was playing it was did I successfully survive the day did I successfully eat food sleep on a cold bench get woken up by the NPC person who was in the building like fighting a zombie uh you hear gunshots would you like to continue sleeping yes um you know did you and these sorts of achievements the way I see it is it is hard enough surviving in the dark days that we're currently living in for a lot of America and but at least when you like deal with all the baloney all the be all the [ __ ] that you got to deal with in real life um there's at least the possibility that somebody cute you know likes you on Tinder or you you meet someone interesting or you have a cool social interaction that's not gonna happen probably in cataclysm Dark Days Ahead uh I think that uh IRL is is enough of a survival Simulator for me at least at the at the moment um I mean you and you love Don't Starve and like and that whole survival Dynamic I mean that's a that's a like you're in someone's nightmare essentially oh well this is this is an interesting interesting question I guess I haven't played Don't Starve in a long time but you know it's accessible it's whimsical I can kind of like make a goals for myself and there is sort of a tech tree of sorts that you get to follow I guess they're cute Beefalo right okay never mind the cutesy like differences I guess for me that's an interesting question and it's possibly you know possible that you know don't starve might be a stay tuned as well but uh it's an interesting point uh that uh yeah don't starve I guess I found fun and unfortunately uh cataclysm I I did not find to be fun uh and I so I looked through my list and I was like hey what games would I rather Play More Than This uh I believe I'm sorry to say that I I think I would like to play brotato more than cataclysm dark days ahead so it goes at the bottom of my list um again I salute the the proud 1100 devs keep it up and hopefully this will turn into something glorious and even enjoyable to a pleb such as myself right and I'll take us home uh I right now have it ranked as 17 out of no that's well I have a 25 out of 33. um yeah I feel like that's about the right spot I I I feel like I'm in very much the same kind of mindset as well where I'm I'm ranking it at least a little bit on the like where I imagine climbing to um I had a couple of moments of like satisfaction I won't necessarily call them fun but like the the the thrill of uh conquering something of of of of managing to figure out how to get something done did feel like it was a an accomplishment um you know I like murdered zombies I got into that house I successfully fed myself I closed myself like I got a little house thing I got some some food from the ground like it felt much more like a true achievement than almost all the other like survival crafting games where it's like go punch tree food falls from sky super easy like uh when uh we played uh what was that stupid game we played recently well with the one with the to like minds and the worms that spit acid at us and and whatnot oh um you know what was that game we oh it was a Icarus that's right yeah Icarus so another survival crafting game where we're like oh this is boring it's too easy like we have too much food like it's literally overflowing our chests with like meats that we because there's just animals running everywhere like Auto head shots for you like surviving in this game felt like an accomplishment and

I wish that it felt like an accomplishment because of the gameplay and not because it's like managing to like fight against the game like I wanted to be able to fight with the game against things in it not against the game and the things in it so uh stay tuned for when uh chat EBT consumes this game and spits it out as a uh interactive role play whatever whatever you know I'm pretty sure that that might be the origin story for the Balthazar AI system that exists in cataclysm that's probably what's going to cause the cataclysm so also it has no music yeah there's no music or sound effects in the base game if you find uh if you find one of the Myriad of launchers that works I think the one that I've been recommended to is the is the Catapult if you just search cdda catapult launcher that's what I think you have to do that yeah I don't want to have to play like this uh I want to be able to just load a game up and be able to play it without having to utilize like five hours of external resources to be able to play the game you've ever modded Skyrim or Fallout I have but you can play Skyrim without modding it is it really playing is it worse

like I don't have to I don't have to mod music into Skyrim [Music] can you mod in a uh an alert that says there's a a dragon nearby safe mode is on press uh press exclamation mark to turn off you can transform the dragons into Thomas the Tank Engine you know I wish that uh that feature had been in um the uh the fan made aliens franchise roguelike that I played way back um because I I did get killed a number many times just by I was moving and didn't realize that oh no an ASCII art alien had popped out and was eating me but oh gosh was that aggravating to have to deal with like I know you can turn off the safe mode but the game is kind of designed with that like in mind and especially when you're first starting out it's like you you want it on but like gosh what a just turned combat into such a painful experience I can understand what it warns you of serious threats like Canadian geese but yeah when when you're running into extra dimensional monsters you're like yeah I got it um all right let's let's quickly touch on our on some similar games to this there's some more I think accessible open world Rogue Style zombie survival games that I don't think I would touch with the 10 football but maybe more of like an intro to this game that people might find more interesting uh to start with as as a gateway drug there's Terminus Zombie Survival which I think might have all of the quality of life improvements that we've been complaining about um and then a game called project zomboid I think those kind of fill in uh specific zombie related ones uh and then there's our big list of of specific sandbox style make your own fun Rogue games uh including but not limited to dwarf fortress's Adventure Mode specifically caves of cut I'm gonna Loop into that that category um ironically unreal world where you are a Bronze Age uh um Scandinavian survivalist probably more accurate than this game in terms of uh like having to rebuild or like live without Society uh and then you have your uh your downtown Portland uh survival simulator Neo Scavenger uh which follows a similar vein of having to to shank junkies for for bottles of of water to survive so um give those a look see if those tickle your fancy and if you're like you know what I need more complexity cataclysm might be might be right up your your alley I'm looking at project zomboid right now and in open world isometric yeah it's it's it is this game but but better I played it and it didn't really capture my attention it's uh I think much much better I agree with will I've played a little bit of project zomboid way back when it was like fresh and even then it felt more like I'm talking like one 10 years ago uh or complete more more it felt more like a game
