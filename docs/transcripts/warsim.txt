[Music] what's up [Music] come friend and welcome to the throne room of the going rogue gaming podcast I sit before you newly anointed king of the gogpod who hath just pulled a sword from a stone and therefore rightfully deserve the title of King Scott Burger and without that accent and uh with my Royal Court of advisors here may I Grace your court as the official Egghead of the land a will and I of course your uh Infamous Goblin the perhaps a monster in your monster pit or uh Court Jester take your pick

today we are talking worsen the realm of islona released June 28 2017 in Early Access on Steam and recently just graduated out of Early Access in uh December 20th of last year 2022. uh you can find this only on PC on Steam itch.io and is coming soon to Gog I think it's probably a good fit for it this is a solo Game Dev effort by Hugh millyard wait hang on Hugh Millard thought there was an extra eye in there uh solo Game Dev from Cardiff out in Wales uh who I would describe as a total lad but we'll come back to that uh Warson comes in on our data set at the 417th most popular roguelike uh that we have with 132 total reviews and up in the 88th percentile will I think it has it has over 900 reviews now I'm pretty sure I just saw that yeah uh so this is this is because I'm reading from the most recent data poll that I did which I think was in December I'm trying to trying to do that data pull operation once like once every three months or so because it's like it's just annoying enough that like I don't know it takes maybe like six hours to crawl the steam API to do it and not not get kicked off of their their platform uh but you know I think like refreshing that data set every three months is like the good the proper Cadence to like let new stuff come in and mature and not like oh you know it went from 932 to 935 reviews that was worth six hours of watching my computer overnight uh but will you have a in unruly uh Bandit who's just coming to your throne room and you have to describe to him what this game is about or pull the track door button well I'm not gonna pull the trapdoor that's that's a noob trap right there the trap door but um let's see I I would describe this game as uh it's a Tech space adventure betting game or betting fantasy medieval civilization Kenji uh game it's um yeah it's you're building a kingdom and you're making all kinds of decisions at all levels of granularity down to from a throne room level like decisions peasants coming in making decisions about their lives to Wars at large mercenary armies adventuring guilds exploring the lands and Demon hordes and it's just all of this chaos kind of brought to order through the lens of 12 options essentially on a home screen which take you through these various things and over 50 turns you um 50 or more turns you build your kingdom and find your place among the the other rulers yeah I would say this game is very is very unique I think this is this is something that's kind of hard I was trying to figure out like okay what what sort of tags do I apply to this on the grogpod.zone website to to kind of like make sure I don't put like 50 like tag descriptors on there but like it is it is all of that and more it's kind of insane with like uh with it all being wrapped up in a very uh dos-like 1991 style text-based menu um but but it feels it feels much bigger than that

I mean yep that's that sounds right to me Colin uh uh one large complaint right from the get-go is oh we started we're starting to swinging coming in swinging eh well we were talking about we're in the arena wait wait wait wait wait we got to place our bets we gotta place our bats in the disagreement Arena here I'm gonna put 2 000 gold on Colin here this is a this is a meta complaint but uh but also possibly my own my so my keyboard doesn't have a numpad um and big mistake wow yeah physically uncomfortable for me to play this game because you have to click zero and enter many times and my fingers don't stretch that far very well and like my hand would get tired from clicking zero and enter many times and then also like I have to look at the keys to figure out what number I'm pushing so playing this game was frustration I almost went and dug out my old keyboard like 20 keyboard to play this game yeah that would have saved you a lot of grief this is not this that was I think one of the top complaints I saw I think just like some of the Steam Reviews is like yep my keyboard doesn't have that well too bad you know well that's so that's super interesting because I I spent all of my 10-ish hours playing this game all on the steam deck and you would think that this game would be like how impossible to play on it and for the most part I think like uh some people were saying like you know uh oh that you know this this game on the steam deck you have to open up like the the touch menu UI and like press in little buttons but someone had created a um like a fan controller scheme which I think I think the dev should like set as default for it where like the the left track pad just becomes like a a number wheel and like that worked really well where I was just like okay um I need to arrange diplomacy okay left track pad rotate over to the four press and then hit the a button for enter and it was it felt very fluid and natural um I think like the I don't know one or two hours that I spent actually on the PC I was just using like the numbers on on like the top like the thought to use the numpad hadn't really ever occurred to me really I that was absolutely Paramount for me I was navigating everything through the numpad and um if you're I it and this is what I would say to anyone playing on a steam deck or other like if you're not playing this game with it on one half of your screen and a g sheet or Excel or something on the other half you're doing it wrong because you're you're dead you're just guessing you're what you're just you're just uh absolutely guessing at what everything does until you start to build a sense of it through through uh Gathering some data looking at some of the uh uh the variants and all that fun stuff what uh so so this game you can generate generates like a gazillion what was it the a billion different possible races or something I think it's like 98 billion or something something crazy so what what kind of races did you get because I feel like perhaps my playthrough was strongly influenced by the race selection here or the species or whatever you want to call it it shouldn't be I think but I I I I started three games and so I think I've got to sense at least some basic sense of the variance that you should expect and I think that what it usually does is there's probably at least one race that you just can't have diplomacy with out of like I think it's like five races in total or four or five something like that and so one that you can't have diplomacy with because they're too barbaric and so if there's like a certain like subset of dudes that are just they're just so overcome with savagery right yeah they're like trolls or like in this game there's like always two um factions which are goblins and so so those ones are kind of put aside but there are four other independent factions and I'm pretty sure you're always start at war with three of them and then one of them is neutral but like their actual composition only really matters in the sense that yeah if you get I mean obviously if you get attacked by someone whose average battle score is like 250 um yeah you're gonna get dunked on because yours is uh much lower with um yeah I guess battle score before getting into like I I don't want to get too off topic but we're gonna cover this anyway so I'm coming back to you Colin but like just so folks know that battle score is like basically everything in this game is based on some sense of battle score and so um it's just like all the races yeah yeah all Races have essentially three classifications of dudes which is like a peasant class A Soldier class and a night class which for you as a human is 50 100 and 150 but when these other races are generated what happens as I understand it is I'm not sure if it goes from the top down from the bottom up but it basically chooses a random number and it assigns it to that class but it's not quite random because like my assumption here is that when it decides that it wants to build a troll for instance it just chooses from a higher average value and it chooses like a number that's kind of higher in general but then to make sure there's no overlap such that like if it's choosing within a range it's going to make sure that the middle range doesn't go below the first range but you could have a dude for instance I had I played one game the second game where the first the race is generated where was like 13 was the battle strength of their peon like their little like peasant class and then the next one was like at like 49 and a lot was like 113 so it was just super easy to crush them so from that point of view Colin I think you probably could be right in the sense that if you're fighting super strong dudes and you're like actually at war with the independent nations that sucks but so wait hold on I want I want to get a sense of like how weird this was so I didn't really fight the Nations that intensely but when it came to the betting in this Arena which is like as far as I could tell it is the game it's just betting in this Arena one of my races was called the Behemoth lunar godlings um and they had an average HP in the seven to ten thousand range

and they I they did not lose a single fight ever uh the only time that they lost a fight was when there was accidentally two of them against each other and it took like five minutes of me holding down the space button for one of them to win what difficulty were you playing on like easy mode easy interesting the one above easy mode yeah I feel I think I may have accidentally like messed up my race uh settings because I was like I was like whatever this game seems like it's about random okay full random all possible all possibilities and I think I got one that was just like uh you feel like a race of gods and they just kill everything honestly it may have only been like five dudes they're just rotating around through this combat but basically I was just like bet on that guy when he comes up yeah yeah no the you that was broken actually that's uh yeah and I'm just looking at like these so maybe um extras the section of the the menu it shows um what the maximum possible combination of races are and that's the Behemoth Arch demigod King comes out with a battle score of 108 000 but even at the lowest like and that's at the um uh Night level at The Peasant level the best is the Behemoth Arch demigod Guardian which is a 1500 battle score and so this better score relate to battle score is it's roughly um HP from the the analysis I did is roughly um 1.3 times Battle score linear relationship but it's it's near that okay so that sounds like it's absolutely possible yeah so it's possible but like that see it should be unlikely to have yeah I think I think yeah just like the Behemoth and like archdema guy there are some that just are positive modifiers and I think what did you say they were the Behemoth lunar godlings oh yeah Behemoth and then Godly yeah yeah of course that's like probably right next to the maximum possible one out of the 90 million possible I like to think that there's some sort of like anointed like deity from the Stars has come to your like fledgling Arena to like yeah in my fighting pit not even an arena yet it was just a fighting pit there was the uh Behemoth lunar godling King who had like 14 000 HP and he'd fight like a peasant uh-huh oh my God it was like the peasant had like 57 hit points yeah that makes betting really easy I bet uh it does I did find another pit another fighting pit that in the north that didn't have that and it was the betting was a lot more like ah hard to do um yeah like the brawling pit or the scorpion fighting pit yeah I think it's a brawling pit so we we've kind of so I think to answer Colin's question originally about like the races in this game I think like the random generation in this game comes out with a lot of humor and I had a lot of fun with the races that were generated for my game where I had I had some some of the various kingdoms that that I had written down here are Council of the dire are romancers who have various skill levels like will was talking about with like their their peasant their dire novice their dire arm answer and their dire Masters uh we have the foreshadowed tribe the Goblin Kingdom of Iraq uh the infinite shogunate I thought it was a pretty cool name uh and the uh the creatures from the infinite shogunate are soul Demi jellyfish that I could only imagine were like those like creatures that you fight in like one part of Eldon ring that are just like the like if they're real jellyfish floating around and I was just picturing one with like holding a sword and one tentacle and holding a shield and another tentacle like getting like Beat to Death by some lowly peasant from my kingdom uh I think my favorite one from my playthrough right now is the kingdom of barbaric fungus shape-shifting horses uh who are also surprisingly weak uh who on numerous occasions have lost fights to peasants and have cost me thousands and thousands of gold and then we have other things like you know like your typical Bandits or like Savage clan implings um Goblin Berserkers all that good stuff but I had the uh dastardly uh salt centaurs which are not centaurs may have salt but in fact just cowardly and pathetic centaurs that like to rub salt upon themselves which I I did get a kick out of that yeah one thing that I think that overall I really like about this game where I know there's a lot of I well okay I think there's a lot of procedural generation going on I think there's a lot of bespoke custom writing going on as well but I think it's a good sign that I can't tell which is which half the time yeah now that that especially showed like for me I was like when I restarted the game I was expecting new locations like for every but that was one of those things like oh it's the same location so I had no idea that there was going to be um uh that would be that everything there was bespoke and totally like um you know in-depth made by the Creator versus the races which were all made so when you mean locations you're talking about like regions of the world right like things explore in like the north east and south and west of the the realm of ozlona as it were because I know that um so okay so uh coming back to what do you do in this game uh you start with a a tutorial from your old Crone who has just sat you down as a as a newly anointed king and you can or queen and you can select like various origin stories uh I wound up picking the I you know pulled the sword from the stone and therefore I'm the rightly king option but I'm guessing YouTube probably didn't pick that one because there's a a big list that you can choose from including one that says it's a long story I did random and I was uh uh I made a pact with demons so that uh the old king killed himself and I became uh ascended to the throne and no one likes me I think I just did a random one as well and then like my my father was assassinated and I took the throne uh I got demons every turn really yeah huh my I I I was like sworn to a demon and my goal was to like end the world I'm pretty sure

I wondered how like public opinion plays a role and I'm guessing that like that was a side I didn't explore like if you go really negative like I'm guessing torture becomes good or like having a really bad rating where you're just absolutely causing evil is good for your kingdom well I don't know I didn't actually I didn't I didn't play I don't think I played into that quite enough okay I mean there's a was my first playthrough so I didn't really understand I don't really understand what's going on yeah you don't really the first will to satisfy your uh demonic flavor there's a there's like I think it's an Easter egg in the game we're like at the main menu if you just type 666 it'll go into like Devil mode where you torture people yeah I saw that on the subreddit yeah just like someone someone found the secret thing when they type in the 666 and like yeah looks very uh there's lots of torture in this game as I found in the various areas and a specific um area filled with vampires for instance there's a an area where you can just like you know poke people's this guy's eyes out slice his ear off and like do all kinds of messed up stuff to him it's great I killed them all out of Italy which which ones the the southern vampires oh you did okay yeah yeah no that's uh I think that's the best option there well I didn't even know like there's like wanna fight and I was like yeah I'll fight you and then I killed them all and then there was just like an empty town so I'm guessing if you have demons demons all have like a battle strength of like 666 I think which is like way above everything I had my my Army at this point is like 1 million yeah God oh you're on easy mode though right I'm on the like second easy mode okay yeah that's right that's a good way to go through the game the first time but then everything gets so easy that it's just like uh well you dare do anything I will just destroy you yeah I feel like playing on normal mode and trying to be like like the good guy of the kingdom is maybe limiting my options a little where I feel like so the the first thing that you're greeted with as you start this game is that you've recently taken over the the realm the kingdom and you have to prove that you're a worthy ruler because you have a rebellion on your hands and or at least this was this was in my case again like I I don't know if this was the case for everyone else you always have a rebellion do you okay and yeah so it's like I think there's there's that kind of pull in the early game of um figuring out like hey here's how Warfare basically works by starting you off with like hey you know you gotta watch this Rebellion otherwise you're not going to be able to to rule effectively which I think is probably a good a good starting point um but because I'm like well maybe I don't want to throw everyone into the prison just yet uh I feel like like I'm maybe trying to be like too constrained by like your classical like good guy King archetype and maybe not exploring as many options as I as I could be by serving the Demonic Lords or or what have you

yeah no I didn't uh I didn't really have that and my first playthrough I was just trying everything and like hey yeah let's see what happens when I pull this trap door and kill the dude let's let's see what happens when I give a presence uh no gold when I give him as much gold as he's asking for more than that and like just kind of like doing everything and that kind of gives you I think a good sense especially early on of like what is all possible what sort of reactions to expect from things um could you describe for me what you would do on a normal term year oh I had that all saved in fact in my logs over here um game three turn notes and it's very detailed um yeah this last you want to hear like what attorney I do because I'm genuinely unsure where the fun is okay so this is turn nine and this is on insane difficulty in which you start with one land and you have uh 50 gold I think you have some in the bank but I don't remember how much and you have like 25 men or something like that and so um and everyone else has like thousands of men and you are just like this tiny little dude with no upgrades in your kingdom and like it's it's a rough start but I think with the optimizations made it's what allowed me to by turn nine the first thing I did was I earned 33.75 000 in the um Arena um first thing uh you learned early on that you subsidize the arena as soon as you do that you unlock an insane amount of uh gold betting and then you just never lose that gold budding when you have optimize how to do it and so when you have a Google sheet of like all of the uh the battle scores well yeah you're right I mean like there's a chance that you could lose like but the chance gets very small if you if you mitigate that risk through just the the right analysis and your right understanding of like what battle scores um win at what probability but anyways so you in 10 in 10 Rounds essentially you all you have to do is win about three or four and if you don't have enough money early on you take a loan because if you take the loan make the bets make them right then you can pay off the loan you have tons of extra money but anyway so I earn money um I explored a little bit to the east my goal right now is to first hit all the mines and unlock the mines because that's the highest income like Roi investment as far as my analysis shows and then you um so hang on what do you mean by hit the mines exactly because I've come across a few mines so far and I've only just really kind of talked to the people who own it and like oh yeah are you supposed to like conquer them are you supposed to do trade deals with them well right now um they said there's 129 different unique locations each of these 129 I have in my document over here with um how far like essentially there's like three or four different levels of depth from you and so I made this and I for each one of these 129 I get assigned a level of desirability based on its incoming provides or the function it provides and how useful it is to your Empire because I and then I created the build order essentially that says I need to go here first then here then here and here and so my build order is essentially like go to the Montford mine West is the first thing you see you could demand tribute early on it has 350 men after you're able to take it you put 500 peasants in there and then you're earning 4 000 gold per turn yeah what okay yeah the mines are good yeah and it's consistent there's like a lot of them have variation but these ones are just always the same amount every time um and then like Caravans or another things like you got to hit the Caravan establish a trade route and that's just easy income and so like yeah there's a whole build order here um and that's what I've been playing at on turn nine uh I I had a new Goblin slaver this is just a random thing that happened my my old one died new one came in he charges only one gold for a goblin usually they're like five six seven eight more twelve but no gold and so what you do is like I wanted to lock him in so I immediately hired a a an army of guards to protect this guy and keep him permanently safe and so now I can always get goblins every turn for one gold for a goblin and goblins have the second highest Roi in terms of battle score for for per gold coin so I got into this if you can't tell that's why I mean as you'll see I give this game a good rating because I just anytime I can crack a g sheet open and figure it out I love it there's a very uh uh appropriate like level of hinchy style like over overwhelming analysis that you can do I feel like for like optimization and like how many slaves do I need in order to get my economy running kind of a deal exactly and that's that's for me what so much of the satisfying part is um the turn concluded though with one extra thing which was I hired a mercenary Army to um I wanted them to take the lands from the rebels they had six lands left and they get five attacks and I found the one that I did analysis of each of them to see the average battle score the number of units per for the cost so I could appreciate the the mercenary companies yeah exactly um and so uh yeah I just uh hired them I sent them out um he unfortunately the one I hired they kind of randomly decides whether or not they charged for Invasion and so this was costing me an extra 2100 to do the an actual invasion of the land you can either um Skirmish raid or invade lands and I wanted to take their land and so I decided not to raid i instead I assimilated them there's basically a one-third probability that when you asked to assimilate them that they do nothing um but they end the contract you just lose them they lose the gold or they join your army and if they join your army you essentially like that's the best way to grow your army size in terms of cost Effectiveness because you spend essentially like 6 000 gold on what what is like 312 soldiers which would otherwise cost you about 30 000 gold to like purchase them over the course of many turns because it's hard to get that many all at once so that was my turn and it was highly successful and now I've got like something like 5 000 units on this insane difficulty by turn nine 19 lands because you have the way I've hired mercenary it's just oh it feels so satisfying to feel like I really at this point there's nothing that can stop me this is insane uh once you know how to play the game and how to beat it interesting so when so okay your your main menu that you have in this game I think we've talked a lot about uh Arena betting uh we've talked a little bit about the bank uh this like main menu allows you to like do troop management allows you I think you've kind of touched on hiring mercenary companies there also but you can hire uh staff and champions to kind of like help uh sub manage elements of your Empire uh so having like hiring a spymaster that will tell you like you know oh here's I think that's how you go about assessing enemy and or other Empires things like their troop trees so you can see their battle score or like their relations with other Empires and things like that um which is super interesting I think for me with like not not quite not quite the uh the scale of uh Google sheet optimization strategies but for me more like okay who should I Ally with so that I can like push against like an an enemy like mutual interest or something like that one of my one of my Royal advisors suggested that so after I put down the Rebellion group uh there's still like these Bandits that I guess roll around your city and they're you know they're just like gangs that kind of push people around and steal gold here and there um but one of them was suggesting like oh we should uh Ally with a couple of them and then have them just infight each other so we don't have to fight all of them at once like that that sounds like an interesting strategy I don't know if that's something that like the game suggested because of the state that I was in or if that's just something that that royal advisor always says but I was like huh like that that like ticked a box with me of like being interesting and unique enough that for just like this quote unquote simple looking text-based game felt very deep and Rich for what it was um and I feel like that that just kind of like touches very briefly on the surface of of like the diplomacy menu for example um I haven't even really gotten into anything like changing the laws of the land is another option you have in your main menu Kingdom upgrades like I don't have a library yet so none of my people could read books and I look at the prices of them I'm like God 25 000 gold where am I going to get 25 000 gold from I think I've been always sitting at like five to nine thousand gold at all times I'm just like okay I know I could go the FanDuel sponsored gambling addiction route in the arena but is that is that like the most fun and best way to play in the early game do you do you want you want some numbers I mean I can give you I can tell you exactly what to expect here uh let me pull up my uh my income statement uh here it is uh so um on a per turn basis uh it looks like it varies but um the arena makes up about 78 to 85 percent of my income wow that's across all of the assets that I have and all these assets are the Primo like the like in theory the best assets you could have at least at this stage of the game so which means that like essentially I last turn I made 33 750 from the arena and I made in terms of all of my other assets put together 9153 oh that's all the taxes across 18 lands all the the goblin slaver the the Caravans the pillaging so the arena once you under like that's why Colin I think was saying that like this is the game is the arena betting like once you figure that out it accelerates you towards everything so much faster and they and the arena grows like it like very quickly in terms of how much you can start to bet like I I wasn't tracking it before turn seven but it went from Max bet of 35 000 to 45 000 to 65 500. I think it might scale the number of lands you have I'm not 100 sure I haven't actually analyzed that quite yet but um if that's the case then that might be what draw is driving this increase because I'm rapidly expanding but and you have to and the only way that you can get income from the arena is to bet is that right I could own it too I mean I think in my game it's 45 000 to purchase it and I think it generates about five to eight thousand and yearly um revenues yeah because like I like I like the idea of the Arena where you go into the arena menu and it's like okay uh Champion lowly cowardly fragile bill is gonna fight Omega hyper warlord uh skull crusher nine thousand you're like okay this seems like a pretty easy bet ten thousand gold on the skull crusher and then it goes to like a little ASCII menu or like little ASCII animation of a little gate opening which I find kind of fun I love that yeah uh and then you know it goes through like a step-by-step process of like you know the lowly crippled peasant tries to swing at the skull crusher and trips over his own two feed and then you know the the skull crusher is you know stabs them in the heart and you know over kills them for five thousand damage or something and all that is fine but you gotta do it a lot right

Arena tournaments and a grand champion tournament like or around uh 11 rounds per turn and and I feel like it's I've I've been pretty entertained by it but I feel like the more that I've been trying to maximize income from the arena it almost becomes I don't know chore-like in a way after a little bit where it's like okay I I have a feeling this guy is going to win big bet on him and then like you know Colin was saying spacebar space bar space bar space bar to like roll through the rest of the combat and I know you can turn on the option to make it go through but then it's just like what is the game so wait what there's an option I feel like this game is already Dwarf Fortress read the battle lugs the game and if you're like what are you what is where's the fun come from is my real question for this game like I I feel like well you and I have very Divergent opinions on this game I appreciate the uh the scope of it what it's attempting to do but I didn't I didn't I found it boring like I mean maybe it's because I wasn't doing all the analysis and stuff but yeah I was just like okay pass through there's there's no animations there's just like text of what the the people are doing okay all right they slap each other for a while you get good at figuring out who's gonna win and like I mean I didn't uh do the the G sheet mode but I could figure out if if any of the Lesser races were were fighting I'd still bet I'd still try and figure out who was gonna win and I could get it right most of the time but even then it's just like ah the the the scarred uh dastardly salt Centaur Gladiator uh versus the one-eyed Bandit warlord it's like then there oh he swung critical hit good job the number went down yeah like the crowd interactions too I thought were a delightful novelty added to that to be fair like it's not just swinging back and forth Miss hit like it's sometimes they'll pause and they'll like fart at each other and then there's a sound effect of that or like they'll like kind of like uh you know taunt each other a little bit or there'll be a warlock in the audience that shoots one of your dudes for you know the fireball for like Critical Hits and kills them so you lose all your money not that that's ever happened to me but uh that's uh certainly uh I think it adds a little bit of flair but the novelty does burn away and that burns away for every single aspect of the monotonous sort of like things I totally agree and um in fact the um the Creator agrees as well um this is uh this feedback is one that I in a steam comment I I you know or uh uh was it a comment a review I uh I posted that and he's like he kind of acknowledged it and I said yep I mean I get it this I think started for him as a a coding exercise that he just kept building on it was like oh yeah this is going on I'm just so like at some point it's just like oh well now I didn't have the end in mind so this mechanic is just really dense but like you kind of once you absorb the novelty I just have to have a way of skipping it and that's why you hire a Stewart for instance to take care of all your throne room stuff that's why you you skip over lots of the minutia of the game eventually yeah I feel like honestly this reminds me you saying that it started as a coding exercise like a lot of it clicks into makes sense to me it clicks into place like this feels like I want to like it a lot because it feels like something that I would make for myself and I think I would have a lot more fun engaging it the way that you have where I'm like trying to really break down how it works or if I were the one programming myself it myself like I built that whole weird Taurus creature simulator thing I spent hours and hours and hours making that and it had nothing it wasn't it wasn't a game it was a weird simulator that I made for myself um I feel like without that though like I was trying to treat this like a game game and I don't I didn't get it yeah I think like I'm kind of in the middle between Wills like hyper obsessive number optimization and Collins kind of bewildering confusement because like I I too like I really like this game I think it's super original I think it's very funny uh it has a very kind of like neither of you have seen the show black at her have you I've seen like clips on YouTube yeah it's very um British super dry humor yeah and I feel like this is this is like the Dwarf Fortress equivalent of Blackadder which like meshes two things very nicely for me uh so I I do appreciate a lot of the the humor and like I think the randomness like really works in this game but like I was getting a little burnt out on Arena vetting uh it was also like okay I need to step away from it because otherwise I'm gonna have to like call one of those gambling hotline commercials that I see on NFL games all the time uh and I was like okay let's go explore the realm another option you have in your main menu thing let's go explore the realm let's see what else is out there and there's like you know will was saying there's a lot of stuff out there uh and I went to I think it's like in the west or the North or something there's this um this like black uh Black Market kind of town that you go to that has all like these little districts in it like okay I wanna like explore this world more like get me more into the theme of like what's what's happening outside of my like little kingdom and throne room and it felt very very interesting to explore more of that stuff so I went into this uh um black market Zone and I went and looked at all these kind of like slums and like talk to like people and they're they're like all have these kind of different personalities and each thing that you in this game uh that you interact with has like a little like ASCII art thing that pops up at the top I think all the ASCII art is very well done in this game uh it has a very like good um sense of like abstractness to it but also like kind of comic cartoony funness um so I went to I went to the black wall uh to see all of the the um Local Heroes that had banished uh uh uh enemies of the past uh I've I went to uh this one uh dingy uh bar Place who that's run by a and I don't know if again like is this randomly generated or not like if it is incredible if it's not it's still fun where uh you approach the woman known as mag and quickly noticed the worst smell of is not the food but her uh and so I was like boy this food sure looks tasty and her response was like

or something like that and I was like okay this food looks disgusting and then her response was like are you coming home tonight and I was I was just like this is this is perfect and all the food there looked disgusting there were bloody rags and maggots in it and everything and like this is this is great uh I found I found a strange orb that I could buy for 500 gold coins I don't know what it does I don't have an artifact Hall to put it in I should go probably build an artifact Hall and see what happens probably something bad but maybe something fun um there is there's a lot of references to to Demons in this game Colin I think like you you may have spawned as like basically the final boss and we're basically like if if you had started a game of Oblivion and you were like no it wasn't the final boss I was the final boss's Minion Okay I could see him in the mirror I could go talk to a mirror and I would talk to like the Demon Lord and and like ask him for more demons and you'd be like how dare you how dare you ask me for more dreams we already spoil everything there is in fact something you might consider a final boss that is within the demon gate to the South yeah and I was yeah that was going to be my next thing was like there's there's like these little dotted references of like some people come to your throne room saying like I worship the Demon Lord and you should do and I'm like tell me more and they're like you know I've seen the future and he brings a world that will destroy and devour all and it would be yes I'm like okay guards kill him uh and through my explorations of like the South and the East and stuff I'm like okay I'm finding like hints to this Oblivion style demon gate thing that I want to investigate more so I think like my fun with this game is is not so much like the economic optimization part I I kind of like that's kind of like wearing on me a little if there was a royal advisor that I could just say like hey go go bet for me and like I want you to bet in this kind of style and I don't want to have to think about it ever again like do that kind of factorio style optimization and automation for me and like we're golden like I don't want to I don't want to have to go in like into each individual Empire to like get reports on them like that's what the spymaster is for do that for me uh maybe it's just like that's missing for for like the gold getting aspect but the yeah I think the principal fun for me has been exploring the world seeing what all there is to offer and failing the stupid history quiz that they have for the the history Guild that was like why is this here's this like incredibly detailed history of the northern lands with like how the Western Empire invaded and how like the the thick Bloods and the and the black Bloods were you know betrayed by uh by the Swift snow tribes and all these things like okay okay uh this is all fun Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip oh there's a quiz at the end uh let's see how good I like that I didn't uh and I got a uh I think I got an 11 out of 20 on the quiz at the end like I'm pretty sure it was like this and then the the uh The Guild Master was like came so close to a passing grade but now I have to take the quit I have to go through all the studies all over again if I want to try to get uh accepted into the history Guild so there's stuff like that like there's stuff that um and again like I'm I'm only like maybe 10 hours into the game like there's it feels like there's a lot of more stuff than just the arena but I do remember there was like this funny screenshot posted to will mention to the very active subreddit for this game uh the the developer is I I would say very very dedicated in keeping a lot of the uh the life in his uh game alive uh where there was one screenshot in there that was like you know um oh we should arrange diplomacy with this one uh one Kingdom or something uh and then the advisor saying like oh well this is warsim ain't it it ain't peace sin huh there's lots of little equips like that all throughout the game I mean as you said like the the writing for each one of these unique experiences is so novel and uh I mean I agree with you completely like that's that's to me what a lot of the draw of it is I think there is a a type of gamer that like where it's the extension of this that wants to read all the lore all the Poetry all the books and this stuff and that's uh that's not me and uh they're they definitely they definitely provide a lot of that in the form of like read all this history and then take a quiz on it um but that's not me um my goal is to crush my enemies see them driven before me and hear the Lamentations of their women so like that was and to do that in the most optimal way possible so I skipped a lot of the walls of text and ended up just not engaging with a lot of those kind of quizzes this quiz or you know all that stuff yeah so I think maybe my experience was the bad Synergy of both of yours I neither engaged with the Lamentations of their women nor their walls of text and instead just wandered aimlessly in the wild North uh looking at at uh at rocks and then finding the tombstone and touching it 13 times as you said I should never do GameStop 13. it even says if you touch it 13 times it kills you and what do you do you touch it 13 times incredible

Joy uh yeah I did I touched it 14 times you're right um uh that did bring me some small Joy I was like well I guess I got exactly what uh what I what they said uh was going to happen so there we are um so here's a question this game is nothing like nor should it be nothing like uh Civ or Stellaris right but I feel like they feel like yeah there's a

it is in that itch it's the simulator yeah so what Colin for you because because you're a big fan of Civ you're a reasonable fan of Stellaris I played Europa universalis by the Crusader Kings uh

this game I think the the the dev had said like it was it was very much inspired by like Mountain blade warband uh he said it was also inspired by another game that I haven't heard of but I looked it up and looks very like you can see where the inspiration comes from called King of dragon pass yep um I have that okay I never played it that much but it king of dragon passes is another game that feel it feels very similar it's a text-based uh decision generator yeah and

honestly I think maybe one of the things that's come out of this is that I I actually do need Graphics like the fact that there was not a map deeply deeply made my I I need I needed a map I needed a map of Their Kingdoms I needed to see where it was that I was going like I need to see what why are why is this Kingdom hate this other Kingdom I don't I need to I need to graph I need I need visualizations I I can't go in there and look at just I found that there was a lot of reading and I'm willing to do a fair amount of reading but I need to be pretty darn invested in it to go do that and so without a map without graphs or statistics or plot charts or something like that I mean so when I made my own basically Evolution simulator which is like my equivalent of this game half of it was me figuring out how to make cool graphs of it or cool visualizations of it and like find ways to because I feel like there's there's a lot of stuff going on in this game in the same way as like something like Dwarf Fortress which I feel like is a is a similar feel where it's a simulator of a whole universe there's a lot of stuff going on in the background um and I'm trying so hard to to bring that out in an efficient way uh but it's not it's mostly like will just brought it out by manually putting it into a g sheet and calculating it all out and I maybe want my food to be cut up a little bit more for me yeah I I want you to to yeah I want my hot dog I don't have to go hunt it first yeah I'm 100 on board with with the map idea I think that like the ASCII art in this game is great and I think if there was like because when you go and explore the northern lands it looks like it's filling out a little a little map for you right yeah okay this is great like I can then see like where everything is kind of located relative to everything else I think there's been some stuff posted in the worst subreddit of like here's this like handcrafted you know like very artistically beautiful map that they made of their world like that's great give me like a goofy looking ASCII version of that like I would love that that would be amazing um and the the other thing that I would really want is um some kind of like very hand-holdy like Noob level um Throne Room advisor that's like here's what you should be doing next because I know like this game's very open-ended and very open world and but like you know is is there like an end goal that I should be going towards or should I just be betting on snail races the whole time like is that the end goal of the game like maybe it is for some people but why did you get snail raises uh there is a town in I forget I think it's like in the west somewhere that one of like the little things that you can do there like that's where you find the snail races it's in Rim Village that's a depth one in the farad uh desert to the east

you make good money betting on snails right here no the only betting you should do is the arena all the brawl All the Other pits and everything like the the names don't make it obvious enough to know which to bet on it might at least in my quick view of things but I want I do want to address the map complaint here because I think you're completely wrong uh the map like the map a map wouldn't really make sense here because of the way like it's designed in such a way that when you're exploring you're going you know in the four Court cardinal directions and you just go out 10 and then like you go out 10 more and like you're basically going up and down one grid like you know up to in the in the case of the West like 40 grids away and you're able to from go from the furthest west to the furthest East South like you can jump around in one turn to every single exported area and so like what would the map do for you like none of that like not being a certain distance away from other things doesn't really make any sense like distance in this game is really just it's just not a an actual unit of measure it's a unit of exploration that you have left to do so beating the game in my view is exploring everywhere and um and maybe like beating all the the rebels Bandits and goblins and like maybe the other independent tribes if you want to but like once you've done that you're pretty much in a dominant like unshakable position yeah I have this idea in my head of I want to see like a little ASCII map of like if if there's procedural generation with where the locations are placed like I want to see like oh I've discovered this volcano that's cool put like the little volcano next to uh like the little Dusty town next to it like just something something that I can like visually wrap my head around of like okay like this is this is what this world looks like I'm less concerned that like oh the mountain is like you know 40 miles Southwest of you know where the the ice Lord's Tower is and that oh it's unrealistic that I'd be able to get to both of them in the same day I'm fine with like magical teleportation because of all the zaniness in this game I'm I'm more just like I want to I want something that I can like print out and hang up on my wall be like this was my adventure that I spent like 100 hours in I remember when like that volcano exploded and flooded everywhere with with lava I don't know if that's an actual event but maybe or like if demons come out of the demon gate like being able to see like that stuff on the map and like from the 10 like you know if you're in a if you're a royal king like you have a map somewhere right you get like one of those big Game of Thrones map rooms that you're walking around yeah I'm just I'm scrambling to find oh something to attach onto like to make the world more real to me uh Will Will made it real through a deep analysis Scott made it real through actually reading some of the text and I need a map I need I need a map I need a I need a picture I need a graph of something I I just I felt like I never really got invested in it um and if you're not invested in it it's a lot of clicking buttons it's like imagine if I I like you're clicking enter in an Excel spreadsheet and it's a random number times 0.6 and you're betting against yourself on if it's going to be greater or less than 0.5 or something like that it's like the fact that it's procedurally generated or even the fact that it's video game I mean I I had I had the same kind of thing in um in Eldon ring where I'm like okay I'm grinding to get better than what uh a non-existent entity like it doesn't matter that I'm better than night number five like I like cool I get better than that but like the fact that in in in this game the fact that I knew that all these things were personally generated and like the betting if I wasn't invested in the world like I there's too much there's too much for me to follow and I feel like and get that in more Fortress too sometimes where it's like I'm trying to follow the combat logs and I just can't do it there's too much going on I can't make sense of it and I need I need a visualization I need a graph I need a play-by-play uh that shows what's going on in this fight that's not just a block of text

isn't that what generates the motivation though I mean like I don't know that was my experience I got into this game I'm just like what the hell is going on like okay I got this log this is how much damage this did okay um this is how much money I got from okay I don't like and I just was full of wonder about like what caused that how do I affect it like and then like what are the tools I have available to me to understand these things and so I of course went right to my G sheet and I'm like well I need to start like figuring it out through you know documenting like you know in this case the arena seems obviously like the biggest source of income so the arena occupies most of my the analysis doesn't make any sense where's the goal come from where's the where's the where's the pit owner getting all that gold from well the the Central Bank patrons yeah it says it tells you how many patrons visit each of the the things every every uh you're ringing them dry every time does it make economics I really am it doesn't make sense that he'd want to do Bets with me if I'm just like winning them all close down the pit he should be like I'm sorry will you're too good at betting we can't allow you to bet here that's you that's really what he should have done and that actually is a serious complaint though the fact that the arena betting is such a large component of your income absolutely 80 cents the Creator wants you to not be that good I think I think the Creator expects somewhere like in between all of us where like yeah you're supposed to just kind of like kind of get it right sometimes oh you're supposed to lose all your gold once or twice and realize oh I shouldn't do that and then kind of be more conservative but you're like supposed to make some money but like not a lot essentially I think is kind of what but if you're optimizing it like you're not supposed to be making like 37 000 like in Gold you're not supposed to be making 85 of your income through the the the arena I'm pretty sure yeah you think the original owner would be like you think the arena owner would be like man this guy keeps winning a lot of bets here um maybe we should cut you off for the evening or something

right or like just like instead of you know paying uh 1.5 times like just yeah hey we're gonna pay you 1.1 times when you win because it looks like you win yeah something like that so okay so like I'm on I'm on like the flip side for your guys's passion for like um for kenshi I guess like can she to me feels like the closest 3D analog to this game and for the life of me like I'm I'm like kind of in the column camp on that game of like okay like what do I do here but like I know you two are both much more into that game than I am so what's like what's like the principal draw in kenshi which is a very open world not quite as as kingdomy management sort of a game but similar in the aspect of like you know oh you're like building up your Kingdom equivalent with respect to all these other factions that are going on like is there is there something that like is missing from warsim that exists in those other kinds of games that would benefit here other than enough I mean I think that the the similar like the core appeal is how do you break the game and figuring out this this is a these both games in my view are puzzle games where it's like you want to understand the economy or like some form of like what makes your dudes able to crush anything how do you get to this status and what's the fastest way to get there so in kenshi answering that question like well first you have to understand what the different factions do I have to understand how the economy works like what you need to produce how big how many dudes do you need to your squad how do you optimize a collection of dude like there's all these questions and how do you solve these questions like solving that stuff is what creates the passion for me and so I know I had lots of spreadsheets for that game too and like looking at all the different lands and looking at all the very specific you know what's the agriculture here what's the water what's the acid level was it the level of the dudes in the area because you can only level up when you're fighting dudes they're more powerful but you don't want to be too powerful and so it's like how do you manage all of that stuff so kenshi the thing about kenshi is that it does does not have procedural generation at all it is a deeply bespoke world that you can get very invested in the specifics of the lore and stuff like that um it is very um what's the word I'm looking for like uh the the stuff happens organically even though it's not procedurally generated but there's like things yeah yeah it's very emergent though yes it is and I can see like so for like they both have kind of do your own goals type of stuff but for something like can she look you can you can choose your mission of like I really want to destroy the Holy Empire or whatever and then I felt like there was a very clear goal that I was striving to towards the majority of time I was playing with kenshi is either get stronger so you're not beaten up by the dust Bandits or then eventually like beat beat the holy Empire or whatever it's like Max the tech tree out I think is kind of like the like what goes along with pretty much every style of play except for unless you want to be completely nomadic pretty much like you always want to like get work on the tech yeah and then build a base yeah which kind of like that's you're either a base Builder or you're a a nomadic sort of like Bandit or a bounty hunter and that's kind of like the two major ways to play the game

I think yeah I think honestly I feel weird and shallow saying that the difference is just that it has a has graphics like I don't like to think of myself as the kind of person who's like uh I only like games that have pictures well so a potential stay tuned episode armored Commander 2 very ASCII driven but also very visually driven in that there's like a big like campaign battle map like you can see advancements of enemy front lines and stuff like graphical to some degree but also very ASCII in that same regard um where I think like yeah like you know Graphics aren't the the be-all end-all but the flip side of that is like yeah you do need some kind of um and like there is a good visual element in here with like the different like pictures of the people's heads that show up or like little yeah cute little like ASCII boats and things and like here's what the artifacts looks like and stuff the art that it did have I thought was very good like I mean good is in a very relative term like it was good for what it's going for it was like a very interesting visually interesting ASCII art yeah um but it did not convey it conveyed story information but not uh Global understanding information

most I just didn't I just didn't understand what I was doing what I was driving for where I was trying to I didn't feel like I had a real goal I mean it was not wasn't exploring the like the entire like map like or like I went North and only North I made the mistake when I first I was like I want to see how far north I can go like that was my goal and I just went that direction and I just kept going and going and I I think that's a very like that was a the goal that kept me like drew me into the game initially now I got to the tombstone and I was like that's far enough North that's pretty yeah that's uh it's Square 19 on the second one right so I mean the north has only three three definitely three so um

you know I don't want to go on a huge stand I just want I'm just I'm just excited for the the future though where this kind of game okay if we can just imagine the not too distant future we're plugging a just chat GPT style of thing into the creation of like the story and like all the dialogue but then you have like the extra layer that doesn't exist quite yet which is like creating the betting mechanics creating like these mini games essentially and like all that all the behind the scenes in the depth behind each of these locations and like really varying the the degree of depth on these locations too like somewhere just Baron some of them are like you know buried but like that could all be created by some AI in the not too distant future and I think that'll be very cool just like boom just create games have people play them and the best of them just raise rise to the top of like this is the cool new warsim like game that you know is AI generated I think you're half right in that I think like everything procedurally generated and programmed here is is great for what it is maybe there needs to be and maybe there is but I just haven't encountered it yet like more of that emergent interaction between like oh like if I like bet a ton of the snail races like how does that impact my relations with or like my interactions with things in the throne room or other factions um but like to Collins point I I think I would almost prefer the flip side of that where like the game is programmed and written how it is but using like mid-journey or stable diffusion to like AI generate the art of like the stuff that it's describing because there's lots of like tell me more about this Ice Wizard what does he look like like show me a battle scape of like this invasion of of the Northlands like that sounds kind of cool I want to see what that looks like and even if it is like some like goofy looking ASCII thing like cool or like if you had something where on the back end it was plugging the stuff into mid Journey it was plugging in the ASCII art and then like weird set key phrases it and just like here's a generated image of this dude would it work I don't know not not today but in the future Maybe um are we thinking maybe we should uh oh uh yeah which rank I'll I'll start off I'll start off with the rankings uh well and not because it kind of leads in from the I I want to like this game because it it deeply intersects with my interests of simulation and

building an emergent game and like the the I don't I I have a hard I'm having a hard time even explaining like what I want out of it but for whatever reason I just I didn't find it very interesting and it makes me sad and I don't even I like I don't think that that means other people wouldn't find it interesting and obviously some of you did well uh I I feel like this is going to be a polarizing game for us but I would imagine it's a it'd be a very polarizing game if you gave it to a random subset of people there'd be some people who really like it and a lot of people who just bounce off it's like I don't understand what I'm doing here um so like for me I I put it as my number 10 out of 15 games it's below dungeons of dreadmore it's a dreadmore I think it's still pretty I'll go to bat for dreadmore it's uh okay so for me it's above a valley without wind so it's it it is well I guess that's where I mean it needs to be above that game but so it's I'm gonna say that right now it it is the threshold it is now the lowest end of the threshold of games that I'm like this wasn't an objectively bad game like you would like to like

I would recommend it to very specific people and I would be willing to watch it and I want more games like it to exist which I feel like that's a weird it's a weird contribution just like I didn't like it but I want more games like it to exist I feel like that's kind of how I feel about Dwarf Fortress where I'm like I didn't particularly enjoy it but I want more of it I want I want simulation you won the rim world that came later yeah exactly so um I like the idea of it I just didn't really enjoy playing it

Scott um yeah I'll go next uh I really like this game I think it's very unique in that uh I never really played a lot of Dos games growing up but I feel like this is what would be like the Pinnacle of of like early 90s dos games would be uh and yeah like it's it's rough around the edges you know you I think like it's hard for games that are developed by just one person to really have every element like fully polished to like a triple A level but my expectations for this were uh like some kind of interesting Universe to explore um I think the humor in writing was like a neat surprise like I didn't expect it to be like as funny and like you know I mentioned earlier very black artery as it was that kind of very dry uh like British style humor uh I really like a lot um but yeah I think like the the aspect of like early game like okay you put down the Rebellion great like that's a very clear goal to have now what do I do like it kind of seems a little overwhelming if there was an advisor to say like well do you want to focus on like exploration do you want to focus on economics you want to focus on diplomacy here's here's kind of like you're you're very like Noob friendly options like I'd like to focus on exploration please what can I do to make my kingdom better at doing that like send like oh here's how you send nights out on quests and stuff and okay great like hand hold me through like the first game and then like allow me to take the training wheels off for insane mode for like that that Uber challenge of like oh now I've got to go and fight you know the the the super sieve on the other side of the continent kind of a deal um but yeah overall I really like it I think the the ASCII art is super good uh I've been taking like copious screenshots of like all these goofy encounters that I have and there's like on the um like I'll mention the war Sim subreddit once again like there's a uh like a couple lists that the developer put on there of like here's 101 things to do in the game and he put out another like 101 like goofy things and some of them are like uh view the corpse sculpture in the thundle tavern watch a monster fight in bayaya listen to a thundle vampire Bard torture someone by us by his torture chamber listen to a procedurally generated gnome Whistler like enter the Demonic realm these are all like like this is this is like perfect for me I don't know that I can sit and play this game for like longer than 30 minutes at a time because it does it's it's almost kind of like reading a book to some degree it doesn't like require that you're doing for like eight hours in a row just one book straight through well I mean I'm a pretty slow reader too like I'm not one of those freaks who can just like look at the words and then like process them later like I have like I have a little voice in my head that's like enter the Demonic realm one word at a time um but yeah I think like I think this game is very fun uh I'm glad that that we picked it out uh this for me I was waffling up like do I like this game better than Binding of Isaac and I think no because uh I think Binding of Isaac like engaged like kept me engaged more like I could sit and like play Binding of Isaac for a solid eight hour straight no problem um we did just play fights in tight spaces I feel like this kind of splits the difference between the two for me as my number four game out of the 15 that we've ranked in that it's very unique I like all the art style and goofiness about it um I just wish there were like better hand-holding options or a more clear uh call to action for like okay you put down the rebelie and now what like have I beating the game like what else is there to do uh I get that there's like a lot of stuff and I'm excited to explore it but like give me a hint or two of as a war should I go next

reasonable um incorrect of course because it's the best game that we've played so far to dates out of the 15 games this is my number one spot I give this game an 8.5 out of 10. um of course I I can she as mentioned earlier that's one of my very of my five 10 out of 10 games of all time and so um yeah this game uh for a an ASCII art text based game I was so surprised and delighted that um that we we played this um I in fact that I'm going to continue to play this probably for another like five ten hours I think at some point the novelty will be completely Zapped out of it and I think that once you do explore everywhere um you can't try every option right because once you destroy a place like you can't do all the options that you didn't choose but like I kind of get the sense of how everything goes now but like in getting that initial novelty it's just so delightful and I think just like as you're talking there like what you reminded me of is like when I went to there's some Caverns where you find some gnomes essentially and they and they uh and they have like a gnome uh insulting challenge that they have and so they and there's like and so like all the other Battlers the Scorpion battle or the Broadway the brawler battles like all these little betting games there's probably like 10 or 15 20 different beta games in there this is one where they just two gnomes and they have like their self-respect as like the something like that as like their like HB and then like they insult each other and then when they get insulted their eight their HP their self-respect goes down and then they eventually run off crying and that's them losing and I'm just like that is great you talk to the the uh uh the owner of that the caverns and you say hey why aren't you betting on this and he's like what's betting if you introduce the concept of betting to the civilization you come back later and suddenly this guy's Rich he's got golden Idols to himself he's in he's just like yeah thanks for telling me about betting I just made I'm not I'm a rich now and here's some money thanks for doing that for and it's just like that sort of thing where it's just everywhere is a surprise and Delight in addition to all the optimization in addition to the puzzle solving of the the betting of the diplomacy oh my gosh like the there's lots of depth in that too but I could ramble on and on and on about what's the best way of doing everything as you as you've seen here and I probably get it wrong too because there's some aspects of the game that I haven't seen yet but yeah 8.5 out of 10 for me and I don't know I don't think there's much that I can criticize here other than like the things that already brought up that at some point things get monotonous and the best games don't allow for monotony to work them into the games they evolve so like the paper clip game is a perfect simulation game um in the sense that everything you're doing is scales up and as something is about to get old you've done enough times it morphs into a different mechanic and that's new the novelty is refreshed and so that's something that this game could have utilized a little bit but I don't know how you would have done that without keeping kind of the end and the progression in mind from the very beginning because uh that's a that's a that's something I don't know how it would have been accomplished I think it's as good as it can be for what it is

all right uh email if you want to write into the show grogpodzone gmail.com if you want to follow us on Mastodon we're grogpod gamedev.place and we have our fancy website grogpod.zone where you can find all of our rankings you find a Google sheet of where we're getting all this data from I should probably refresh it at some point but probably wait till till March or so to do that um Colin can you give us a little preview for what game you've selected for us to cover next oh you know you've been waiting for it it almost came up before we're gonna be doing Cog mind yay finally uh my actual introduction to to like a true true roguelike I think this is gonna be the the rookiest roguelike that we've done in quite some time and I I know Scott and I have both played it before and both very much enjoyed it and will has played it and didn't enjoy it but maybe he'll enjoy it this time around right yeah New Perspective and he should like it because it's creaking
