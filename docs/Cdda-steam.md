# Cataclysm: Steam Days Ahead

The 2023 release of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead on Steam has garnered some controversy in various channels like Discord. For the [GROGPOD Roguelike Podcast](https://grogpod.zone), I sought out some major developers from CDDA to get their take on the situation. 


## As one of the top contributors of CDDA, were you aware of any plans to have KorgGenT place the game for commercial release on Steam?

### Kevin Garande
KorGent worked closely with the core contributors before,  during,  and after the release. He explicitly had our blessing to do it. 

### Dave Seguin
Yep, pretty much all core developers have been aware long before the Steam release was anounced. I believe it was one of the other senior devs who pitched the idea following the Dwarf Fortress Steam release, and suggested to Korg that he should set that up.


## Are you aware of any revenue-sharing plans from the Steam release to be shared amongst the contributors of the project?

### Kevin Garande
There are none. We did not anticipate earnings being large enough to meaningfully distribute,  and so far the steam stats bear that out. It's a nice windfall for KorGent, but not enough to go around. In addition,  NO ONE who is remotely in a position to be the legitimate head of funds disbursement would want anything to do with it. We're doing this for fun,  and we don't seem to have any contributors that think highly contentious accountancy is a fun thing to do 

### Dave Seguin
I think initially some ideas for revenue sharing were briefly floated around, but the majority of the team have been against it, since they really didn't want to deal with whatever mess comes with monetization (myself included). Moreover, Korg has been in a rough spot during this time, and he actually did the work to Steam-ify the game, so it felt reasonable to let him manage the release and the revenue.


## Where do you see CDDA development in the next 1-2 years as a result of the Steam release?

### Kevin Garande
I see it potentially accomplishing several things.
1. Allowing KorGent to work on DDA more. He's a pretty prolific contributor,  so this is quite a big deal. 
2. Keeping someone outside the project from attempting to make a steam page. This has already happens twice before,  it's not at all hypothetical.
3. It might become a hub for mod distribution.
4. It might drive more people to play a maintained stable release. We've historically been extremely bad at providing a maintained stable release due to lack of percieved payoff, but this might change that.

### Dave Seguin
To be frank, I really don't think the Steam release has (or will have) much bearing on the project itself. It's really a side venture headed by Korg. And he the rest of the team are focused on improvements to the project itself as an accessible free and open source game. We are seeing more first-time contributors than ever, but I would hesitate to attribute that to the Steam release. If anything, we're seeing more players finding the game through the Google playstore (how people manage to play the game on a mobile device is both impressive and scary, haha).

Overall, I think the Steam release is a neat side project. I'm impressed with the work that Korg did for it behind the scenes, and I wish him great success!

You can track the stuff being added to the game in our GitHub repository. Folks are contributing some really cool features for the upcoming 0.H release, and I can't wait to see where it goes :)
