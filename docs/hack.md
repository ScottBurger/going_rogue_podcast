# Q&A with David Williamson of Hack, Slash, Loot

## How did you get interested in video games? What led you to start developing your own games?

Well, I got my first computer in the mid 80s, a lovely Commodore C16 pus/4, and it came with about 20 games. From that moment I was hooked on games. It also came with a syntax book for Commodore Basic, and being the curious type I had to try and work out what all the weird code words meant. It’s a short leap to put an enjoyment of games and an enjoyment of programming together.

## What was your experience publishing your game in 2012?

It was very exciting, and a whole load of confusing. I’d been a hobbyist game maker for years, releasing games for free online, but the rise of Steam and Humble Bundle allowed me to publish a game ‘for real’. It being early on in the cycle though meant there were a lot of headaches. Steam’s back end in those days was a nightmare, but equally they were really helpful in overcoming any problems that that I hit.

## What other games inspired you to develop Hack, Slash, Loot?

This is a tough one as I don’t think I had other games in mind when developing HSL. I’m sure I subconsciously drew inspiration from many games, but the only one I can think of really influencing the game was Eye of the Beholder. My main inspiration was probably tabletop D&D, and lovers of that game can probably see it’s influence running through HSL.

## What makes this game unique in comparison to other Roguelikes?

The limited equipment slots. I know many other games have limited slots, but HSL takes it to the extreme with only being able to carry nine items max. When you combine this with item traits the game is more about equipment management than combat strategy.

## Indie development was very hard back in 2012. What tools do you wish you had available when you were developing the game that are widely accessible now?

Believe it or not my workflow is very similar today as it was back in 2009 when I started making HSL. The toolchain has changed a lot, but the process is very similar. I think the big change in modern tools is their accessibility to those without an existing knowledge of the field. Unity, Blender, etc. are so easy to pick up and use without prior knowledge these days, and there are so many learning resources to help. That’s the biggest change.

## What did your typical day-to-day look like when developing this game? How did you organize your time? Did you rely on any specific tools heavily during development?

I tried to keep a normal work schedule, 9-5 mon-fri, and would work a little extra here and there. I didn’t really find it hard to organise my time. I’d been laid off shortly before working on HSL so it was easy to keep a normal work routine but work on my own game. The only things used to make the initial release were a broken laptop, BlitzMax, and Photoshop Elements. I did receive a lot of help from fellow indie developers though. The indie dev community was probably the most helpful tool I used during development.

## If you could go back and do one thing differently about your game’s development, what would it be?

This is another tough question. Ultimately I made the game I wanted to make. I dropped a couple of features from the game, but I’m happy with the finished results, and development of the game went relatively smoothly.

## If you had all the means necessary to make any game you wanted, what would it be, and what would you hope to achieve?

My ideal game to develop would be something similar to Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress. I don’t mean gameplay wise, but more the way they can keep adding to it forever and it’s still the same game. Potentially Dwarf Fortress development could go on forever and they could still be adding completely new stuff to it.

## With your wealth of knowledge, what advice would you give to upcoming indie developers?

It would be that any advice you get from seasoned developers is specific to that developer. Yes it can be helpful, and you should seek out all advice you can, but remember whatever advice they have may not work for, or be suited to, you.

## The Roguelike genre has expanded considerably in the last 10 years. Where do you want to see it go in the next 10 years?

I’d really like to see it carry on expanding the way it is. I enjoy procedurally generated content, I enjoy the perma-death mechanic, and I enjoy turn-based games. If more developers look to incorporate those features the better.
