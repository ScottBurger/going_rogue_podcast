Every other week we play one of the top 100(ish) games in the roguelike pantheon then rank em. If you're interested in our raw source data that we use to guide the podcast, [you can find that here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RzxBuEFFthKQf1n3AtJONe92vnCsHcyM6qyIaoFmwnw/edit?usp=sharing).

<!-- 
when finished:
* games that X liked more than Y
* games that X and Y agreed on perfectly
