Each week we play one of the top 100(ish) games in the roguelike pantheon then rank em.

* Scott rankings only
* Will rankings only
* Colin rankings only
* Guest rankings

<!-- 
when finished:
* games that X liked more than Y
* games that X and Y agreed on perfectly
* top 'gems' = avg rank vs review rank
* top 'anti-gems' = avg rank vs review rank
-->

The combined ranking data can be found below:

| Game | Scott Rank | Will Rank | Colin Rank | Avg |
|  :----: |  :----: |  :----: |  :----: |  :----: |
| Dungeons of Dredmor | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1.33
| Binding of Isaac | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1.66
