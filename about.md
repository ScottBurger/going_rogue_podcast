## About
![mono](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScottBurger/going_rogue_podcast/master/assets/img/mono2.png)

We started the GROGPOD because we like roguelike games and like complaining about them. Inspired by other podcasts like [Ultra64](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ultra-64-wii-universe/id1308062617?mt=2), [Roguelike Radio](http://www.roguelikeradio.com/), and [Ascension Run](https://ascensionrun.podbean.com/), we thought to bring a new podcast to the genre we love to play. Once every two weeks, we use our combined knowledge of data science, DnD, and general madness to give our thoughts on what we think about roguelikes and try to rank the best ones.

## What is a Roguelike?

If you've never heard of roguelike games before, strap in for a fun and widely varying genre! Generally speaking, roguelike games involve run-based gameplay and a large degree of random variety with the idea being that every time you pick up and play, it should be a fun and unique experience. We recorded a lengthy [deep-dive episode with our thoughts on the topic which you can find here.](http://grogpod.zone/2023-10-11-what-is-a-roguelike/)

But don't take our word for it! Defining the genre is a historically tricky problem, dating all the way back to the era of UseNet. [Check out some examples of how people have been thinking about the genre over time here](https://github.com/ScottBurger/going_rogue_podcast/wiki/What-is-a-roguelike-database).

## What is a "GROGPOD"?

Originally the podcast was titled the "Going ROgue Gaming PODcast", with the idea of covering rogue games of all sorts, but with the option of "going rogue" onto other game genres as well. It turned out to be a mouthful and awful for SEO purposes, so we shortened it to GROGPOD. Not only does it optimize for weirdness, but if you use your imagination you can just assume it means something like "ROG-POD" or "Roguelike-Podcast", with an extra floating G that could stand for anything your heart desires. "Great Roguelike Podcast", "Good Roguelike Podcast" or "Garbage Roguelike Podcast" depending on how poorly one of the hosts rated your favorite game.

## Show Me The Data!

If you're reading this far, you're probably interested in the data we use to drive the show. [You can find all of our historical data snapshots on rogue-type games here](https://github.com/ScottBurger/going_rogue_podcast/wiki/Roguelike-Steam-Dataset).
